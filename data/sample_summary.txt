INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  by . anna __pursglove__ . published : . 18:04 est , 20 november 2013 . | . updated : . 18:04 est , 20 november 2013 . we do n't need analysts to tell us what we already know . the evidence is there on high streets across the country for all to see : well-dressed , middle-class women armed with those familiar brown paper bags bulging with cut-price clothing . and not a hint of shame in sight . primark has become such a middle-class staple that it has even opened concessions in swanky selfridges department stores . a generation ago , these women were customers marks & spencer could confidently call its own . this month , however , poor old marks announced its ninth successive fall in clothing sales - a trend that has been going on for two years , despite its slick # 5 million advertising campaign by renowned photographer annie leibovitz , featuring ` leading ladies ' dame helen mirren , darcey bussell and tracey emin . primark , meanwhile - playing on low prices rather than swanky advertising - announced a record 44 per cent rise in profits in the same period . so is this where the m&s shoppers have gone ? and can primark 's budget clothing really match m&s 's quality ? anna __pursglove__ took to the shops to see exactly how their winter wardrobes measure up . primark : embellished jumper , # 16 , jeans , # 7 , shoes , # 12 , total : # 35 . m&s : embellished jumper , # __49.50__ , jeans , # 35 , shoes , # __29.50__ , total cost : # 114 . primark . embellished jumper , # 16 , jeans , # 7 , shoes , # 12 , total : # 35 . fabric : the acrylic fabric of the jumper is too fluffy for the __embellishments__ and i kept getting them caught on the sleeves . unless you keep your arms pinned to your sides , you 'll have __snags__ galore in no time . fit : the jumper is too bulky to be sexy but too __rhinestoned__ to be practical for daily wear . and do n't mention the shoes - agony . i think primark may have forgotten that women have toes . m&s . embellished jumper , # __49.50__ , jeans , # 35 , shoes , # __29.50__ , total cost : # 114 . fabric : i love this sweater . the __embellishments__ are beautifully detailed without being in your face and the fabric feels as soft as cashmere -lrb- although , in fact , it 's mostly man-made fibres with 8 per cent angora -rrb- . fit : beautiful - the plunging __v-neckline__ sits in just the right place for a subtly , sexy look . you could easily dress this up a bit with a pencil skirt . and the shoes are far more comfortable than primark 's . verdict : save money by buying your skinny jeans in primark and get the rest from m&s . do bear in mind that primark sizes are significantly smaller - i was easily a 10 in marks but a 12 in primark . primark : coat , # 25 , jeans , # 7 , shoes , # 12 total : # 44 . m&s : coat , # 139 , jeans , # 35 , shoes , # 25 total : # 199 . primark . coat , # 25 , jeans , # 7 , shoes , # 12 total : # 44 . fabric : the jeans are lovely and soft , as is the coat - despite being 100 per cent synthetic . i 'm not a fan of the __ultra-shiny__ buttons -lrb- cheap __fastenings__ so often give budget clothing away -rrb- , so i 'd change these for something less obvious . fit : the short coat has a nice sixties vibe , although primark has n't quite got the funnel neck __right.it__ catches you just under the chin , which gets annoying quickly . again the shoes are painfully __unwearable__ - even though i only had them on for a short time . m&s . coat , # 139 , jeans , # 35 , shoes , # 25 total : # 199 . fabric : excellent on all counts . the coat - a polyester and wool blend - feels warm without being too bulky . the jeans are beautifully soft , yet nice and fitted , suggesting they wo n't bag __dreadfully__ around the knees or bottom . fit : i 'm only 5 ft 3 in so often get swamped by coats , with the result that i was particularly pleased with this one . and thank you to m&s for some very comfy leopard-print heels . these i could dance in . verdict : again , save some money by buying your skinny jeans at primark , then spend the difference on the m&s coat . this red number was one of my favourite finds and feels far more expensive than its # 139 price tag . primark : blouse , # 9 , skirt , # 14 , shoes , # 12 total : # 35 . m&s : blouse , # __49.50__ , skirt , # 149 , shoes , # __29.50__ total : # 228 . primark . blouse , # 9 , skirt , # 14 , shoes , # 12 total : # 35 . fabric : the skirt is nicely lined -lrb- i do hate the feel of a __scratchy__ sequin against your skin -rrb- and surprisingly heavy given the price . but the shirt is n't particularly breathable , so i would n't advise any heavy lifting or vigorous dancing while you 're wearing it . it could all get a bit sweaty . fit : full marks for the cut of the shirt and skirt , which is an excellent budget buy . not so many points for the metallic high heels . m&s . blouse , # __49.50__ , skirt , # 149 , shoes , # __29.50__ total : # 228 . fabric : believe it or not this skirt is 100 per cent leather , which is why it feels so lovely and breathable . the shirt fabric , although man-made , still feels airy and light . fit : the shirt is great -lrb- if a little too __piratey__ around the sleeves for a __short-armed__ woman like me -rrb- . but the cut of the skirt is disappointing . neither an __a-line__ silhouette nor a pencil , it 's an indeterminate shape for such a bold fabric . the designers should be more courageous . the shoes pinch a little - not for dancing . verdict : i 'd go with the m&s shirt -lrb- i particularly like the embellishment around the neckline -rrb- , but save yourself some money and go to primark for the rest of the look . primark : cardigan with chain detail , # 14 , dress , # 12 , shoes , # 12 , total : # 38 . m&s : __boucle__ jacket , # 59 , dress , # 69 , shoes , # 25 total : # 153 . primark . cardigan with chain detail , # 14 , dress , # 12 , shoes , # 12 , total : # 38 . fabric : the dress looks ok from a distance , but the lace layer was already beginning to tease itself out into very unattractive strings when i picked this up in the shop - not a good sign . fit : the lining of the dress was too long for the lacey overlay . all wrong . and , yet again , it 's best not to mention the shoes . i like the cardigan , however . it 's cut nicely and is a good compromise if you ca n't afford to splash at m&s . m&s . __boucle__ jacket , # 59 , dress , # 69 , shoes , # 25 total : # 153 . fabric : this lace dress is lovely and soft , and __boucle__ jackets are a particular favourite of __mine.you__ would expect to pay well over # 200 for a jacket like this from a designer label , so this really is an absolute bargain . fit : the frock is so flattering - it really sucks you in at all the right places . the shoes with the bow detail were almost as comfortable as the leopard-print heels . verdict : the primark dress looks and feels cheap and is cut very badly . i 'd go for the marks one every time . as good as the primark cardigan is , i must say that the winning item in this section is that classy m&s jacket . primark : dress , # 10 , shoes , # 12 total : # 22 . m&s : dress , # 99 , shoes , # __29.50__ total : # __128.50__ . primark . dress , # 10 , shoes , # 12 total : # 22 . fabric : i was definitely braced for __scratchy__ lace considering that this __skater-style__ dress cost only # 10 . but again , a pleasant surprise from primark - how on earth do they manage it ? fit : a shorter , __flirtier__ style , but every bit as good a fit as the m&s dress - for nearly a tenth of the price . just a shame once more about the excruciating shoes . so tight ! when it comes to these outfits , primark just ca n't match the quality of marks ' wearable shoes . m&s . dress , # 99 , shoes , # __29.50__ total : # __128.50__ . fabric : not a hint of scratch to the lace here either , so well done m&s . the red shoes are reasonably comfortable but not quite as suitable for a night on the dancefloor as the leopard-print pair . fit : the lining of this dress was a little too flimsy for my liking , and really was n't as supportive as the chic black lace number . you want to feel really sucked in by a __va-va-voom__ style like this and i did n't . but the full-length sleeves are very flattering , especially for older arms . verdict : sorry marks , but i ca n't see a reason to splash out nearly # 100 on a red lace dress when you only need to spend a __tenner__ . primark wins this one hands down . or should that be hem up ? styling : eliza scarborough .

' those opposing the law cited a fear that dutch residents could sell the marijuana they could legally purchase on to tourists at an inflated price . national party deputy gerardo __amarilla__ said the government was underestimating the risk of marijuana , which he called a ` gateway drug ' for other chemical addictions that foster violent crimes . ` __ninety-eight__ percent of those who are today destroying themselves with base cocaine began with marijuana , ' __amarilla__ said .

'' but merah had appeared on the security services ' radar , according to molins . during his first trip to afghanistan , `` afghan police checked his id during a traffic stop , and as a result he was handed over to the u.s. army , who then put him on board the first plane heading to france , '' molins said . -lrb- a senior u.s. official gave a different account , saying afghan forces had actually handed him over to french troops , who had him repatriated . -rrb- . merah had been under surveillance by french intelligence for years , according to interior minister claude __gueant__ . even so , he was apparently able to visit the __afghan-pakistan__ region a second time and then accumulate weapons after returning home , including an uzi machine pistol and an assault rifle , plan a series of attacks in toulouse and __montauban__ , and force the french government to step up security precautions nationwide . the jihadist trail . french authorities believe that between 20 and 30 french nationals are tied to jihadist groups in the __afghanistan-pakistan__ border area . however , one french intelligence estimate in 2010 put the potential number as high as 200 or 250 . in 2008 , a group of militants traveled from france to pakistan 's tribal areas , where they joined al qaeda , including hamza el __alami__ , a french citizen of moroccan descent . __alami__ was killed in fighting in the border region . who is mohammed merah ? in fall 2010 , another militant returning from the region and suspected of meeting with al qaeda operatives was arrested on suspicion of plotting a terrorist attack in france . france 's growing pakistani diaspora has added to concerns about travel flows to pakistan . french intelligence services have invested heavily in keeping tabs on nationals who have made the trip recently . in april 2011 , two french nationals were arrested in lahore , pakistan , after meeting with umar patek , an indonesian al qaeda-linked operative . the two -- one of whom was of pakistani descent , and one of whom was a convert to islam -- met patek so he could transport them for training in north waziristan , according to pakistani intelligence officials . radicalization in europe . what is unclear is when and how merah was radicalized , whether online or through membership of a radical islamist group in europe . __gueant__ said wednesday that merah became radicalized amid a small salafist group in toulouse and had connections to a group called __forsane__ __alizza__ -lrb- `` knights of pride '' -rrb- . but there is no evidence that any of its members was involved in or aware of his plans . __forsane__ __alizza__ was outlawed in january by the french government , which alleged that it was a terrorist organization training members `` for armed combat . '' for its part , the group said its mission was to fight islamophobia and has said it will contest the government 's decision . but its website used militant language such as calling for `` soldiers '' to defend muslim women . and while there is no evidence that __forsane__ __alizza__ has been involved in acts of violence , it has certainly promoted the threatening rhetoric of others , glorifying __yemeni-american__ cleric anwar al-awlaki , who was killed last year . one member suggested that the right-wing swiss politician oskar __freysinger__ deserved a `` bullet in the forehead . '' __freysinger__ has campaigned against permitting __minarets__ on mosques in switzerland . __forsane__ __alizza__ also seems to be tied to a group called the force de __défense__ __musulmane__ sur internet , which campaigns to have __islamophobic__ material removed from websites . __forsane__ __alizza__ appears to have been strongest in paris and the central french city of __limoges__ , where several of its members were arrested in 2010 after invading a mcdonald 's restaurant and shouting anti-semitic slogans . the group has also protested a french law banning women from wearing a full veil in public places and posted a number of __well-produced__ videos of its protests in french cities . its outlook appears very similar to other radical islamist groups in europe , such as __islam4uk__ in britain and __shariah4belgium__ , as well as revolution muslim in the united states . videos purportedly produced jointly by __shariah4belgium__ and __forsane__ __alizza__ have been uploaded to youtube in the past month . islamic radicalization increased in france in the 2000s , fueled by growing militancy in social media , the role of french troops in afghanistan , and the palestinian issue . bleak socioeconomic prospects in the suburbs of french cities where many french muslims of north african descent live , the rise of the far right in france and the government 's ban on the niqab -lrb- full veil -rrb- has added to the sense of grievance felt by some young french muslims . unlike in the united states or britain , french laws restricted the ability of french radical groups to freely __proselytize__ , but according to some analysts , the lack of a public pressure valve may have itself been dangerous . before his death , osama bin laden tried to tap into the grievances of muslims living in france . in an october 2010 audio recording attributed to bin laden , he attacked the french ban on the niqab . `` the equation is very clear and simple : as you kill , you will be killed ; as you take others hostages , you will be taken hostages ; as you waste our security , we will ... waste your security , '' bin laden said . that message , and similar audio and video postings from the likes of awlaki , resonate with a fringe of marginalized young muslim men living in the poorer __quartiers__ of french cities , with little prospect of work and regular confrontations with police . according to french officials , merah had a series of convictions for petty crime and had been turned down for army service . al qaeda changing gears . al qaeda propaganda and recruitment efforts have shifted emphasis in recent years , from spectacular attacks on the scale of 9/11 to `` do-it-yourself '' attacks that require less training and planning . in june 2011 , the group 's media production arm as __sahab__ released a video titled `` you are only responsible for yourself , '' encouraging followers to carry out acts of individual terrorism in the west . in the recording , __oregon-born__ al qaeda spokesman adam gadahn said it was easy for american al qaeda sympathizers to go to a gun show and purchase an automatic assault rifle without having to submit to a background check . al qaeda 's yemeni branch has been especially vocal in encouraging lone acts of terrorism . its english-language magazine inspire has a section dedicated to helping terrorist sympathizers in the west carry out attacks , including bomb-making recipes . according to authorities , one such formula , `` how to make a bomb in your mom 's kitchen , '' has been downloaded by individuals plotting terrorist attacks in both the u.s. and the uk .
