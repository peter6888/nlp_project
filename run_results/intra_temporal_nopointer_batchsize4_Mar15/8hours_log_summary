INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  england 's campaign at the european under 21 championship looks set to be dominated over whether harry kane is included - but gareth southgate may not need him . in front of over 30,000 at the riverside stadium , england came from behind to defeat germany 3-2 and record a victory against not just old rivals but the pre-tournament favourites in the czech republic this summer . southgate is still expected to do everything he can to include the tottenham striker , but the win over germany shows that the young lions can go toe-to-toe with the cream of europe . here sportsmail looks at england 's three stand-out stars from the win in middlesbrough . james ward-prowse . the southampton star has already become an established member of the first team at st mary 's and is set to be a key member of southgate 's side in the czech republic . the 20-year-old scored the winner with a crisp low effort after __ghosting__ into the penalty box to find space . but his attacking play extends to set-pieces . germany 's julian __korb__ reaches out in vain as james ward-prowse fires home england 's winning goal . the under 21 captain celebrates his late strike following a fine midfield performance . in ward-prowse , england have potentially their best __dead-ball__ specialist since david beckham with his passing range and accurate shooting already a highlight of his game . ward-prowse was captain for the germany victory and his rapid progress on the south coast in the last two years suggests he is worth keeping an eye on . carl jenkinson . named the official man of the match , jenkinson put in a close to perfect performance - albeit he was slightly at fault for germany 's opening goal after allowing the cross for philipp __hofmann__ to fire home . but after a slow start to each half , the west ham full-back , on loan from arsenal , imposed himself down the right-hand side . carl jenkinson runs the ball out of defence for england as germany substitute nico schulz looks on . jenkinson put in a man of the match display having assisted two of england 's three goals . it was the 23-year-old 's cross for jesse lingard which helped draw the three lions level in the first half , while he also provided the pass for ward-prowse to tuck home the winning goal . with england 's senior team lacking depth in the right-back area , roy hodgson could do worse than pick jenkinson . because if he does n't , then finland will as he can still play for the scandinavian team . nathan redmond . relished the battle with germany full-back christian gunter , often managing to pull away from his marker to lead an attack down the right wing . redmond is not all about pace though as he often tried to cut inside to mix up his approach , with his passing in the final third managing to catch the german back four flat on a number of occasions . nathan redmond rifles home england 's second equaliser across goal into the bottom corner . redmond celebrates after drawing england level late in the game following an impressive display on the right . it was a much improved version of the winger who struggled in a poor norwich side in the premier league last season , but having struck the equaliser against a talented germany team he looks to be improving . now a veteran of the under 21 set-up , it will be difficult for southgate to leave him out of the side in the summer to help make space for kane as he has often impressed on the right wing for the young lions .
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: england recorded impressive 3-2 win over germany in under 21 friendly . young lions twice came from behind to seal late win at riverside stadium . james ward-prowse , carl jenkinson and nathan redmond among stars . gareth southgate 's side look in strong shape heading to the european under 21 championship in czech republic this summer .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  wayne rooney has warned harry kane not to let his full england debut be ruined by dirty tricks from italy 's defenders . england manager roy hodgson confirmed on monday night that the young tottenham star will definitely be unleashed from the start in tonight 's friendly in turin . phil jones is expected to operate in midfield as hodgson __tinkers__ with a team who have won seven out of seven this season , and theo walcott could return to the starting line-up . england captain wayne rooney has warned harry kane not let his full international debut be ruined by italy . kane celebrates after scoring his first international goal during england 's 4-0 victory over lithuania on friday . all eyes will be on kane , however , and hodgson spoke of the ` magic touch ' which has helped him score 30 goals this season , including his first for his country -- within 79 seconds of his debut from the bench against lithuania on friday . but england captain rooney , who is set to win his __103rd__ cap playing at the forward tip of a midfield diamond , warned kane what he should expect from the likes of giorgio chiellini and leonardo bonucci . rooney said : ` with italian defenders , they 're clever defenders . they do anything to try and stop you and you have to be aware of that , and not be frustrated . ` they 're a passionate country who love their football and they 're probably the closest in europe to south american teams . they 'll do anything to stop you . they 're tough to play against , organised , make it as difficult to play against as possible . they 're the best in europe at doing that . ` harry 's taking the ball and running at the defenders and getting shots at goal . ` that 's all he has to do , ' insisted rooney , who hopes to match tommy lawton 's record of scoring in six successive england games , set in __1938-39__ . ` i 'm sure if he does that the way he has , he 'll be fine . ' rooney insists italy 's defenders will do anything to stop the opposition and kane must be aware . kane will come up against leonardo bonucci -lrb- pictured -rrb- and giorgio chiellini on tuesday night . when italy beat england at the world cup in brazil , no-one thought kane anywhere near an international breakthrough - but he has made incredible progress . hodgson said : ` it 's great to see people like harry kane come on the scene and it 's a fairytale for him at the moment . he 's got the magic touch . within 80 seconds got a goal on his debut . it does n't get much better . this will be a tougher test , but he will start and hopefully play a large part in it . ` our system will be slightly different because we had a lot of forwards available for lithuania , but we lost raheem sterling and danny welbeck , which has changed my thinking . ` we still have what i consider to be a very offensive line-up . it 'll be hard work for the front six , who have a hard job on their hands .

' but the harper issue does bring back memories of a __depressingly__ frank admission from billy stark , then scotland under-21 boss , in june 2009 . a month earlier , xavi and iniesta had passed manchester united to death during the 2009 champions league final at rome 's stadio olimpico . recalling a community coaching forum at hampden 24 hours before , stark said : ' i was asked whether iniesta and xavi would have flourished and come through the scottish system . ` it 's hard to say because you 're looking at two different cultures but the answer is - probably not . the spanish place an emphasis on sheer technique and movement . our game is based more on power and pace . so there 's an argument that they would n't have come through in this country to become the players they are now . scotland under __19s__ manager ricky __sbragia__ claimed harper is not big enough physically . harper is currently midway through a five-year deal with real madrid and is tipped to have a big future . ` but the spanish approach is working for them and it deserves to be copied , ' he added . former scotland manager craig brown has urged caution in the rush to condemn the under-fire __sbragia__ . ` i 've the greatest of admiration for ricky as a man and a coach , ' said the 74-year-old . ` my friend archie knox speaks highly of him and he 's also worked under sir alex ferguson at manchester united . so i 'd like to hear more on the context of the words spoken by him -lrb- about jack harper -rrb- . ` but i would say this : people are saying this young lad is a real madrid player . he 's not ; he 's never played for real madrid . i was a rangers signing but i never played for rangers . ` real madrid will have hundreds of kids in their system . i 'm not for a minute saying jack harper is not a good player . i have n't seen him so i do n't know . former scotland boss craig brown -lrb- second right -rrb- revealed his admiration for under 19 coach __sbragia__ . ` but i think people get hypnotised by the name real madrid . there 's a frenzy going on but if -lrb- the same player -rrb- played for another club would there be the same impact ? ' brown admitted it is an occupational hazard of a national youth selector to end up looking foolish . ` you ca n't get every player right , ' he said . ` here 's my example : when i was scotland under 21 manager , i got a phone call from the late alex wright , manager of dumbarton , saying he had a good player for me . it was owen coyle , and he was good , but i did n't think he was as good as kevin gallacher and gordon __durie__ . ' i told alex the only reason i would be picking owen would be solely to prevent ireland getting him -- and that would be unfair . he would have been a bench player for scotland . ` so the irish picked him instead and our next game was against ireland at easter road . my __over-age__ centre half that day was alex mcleish and owen knocked the ball past alex and stuck it in the roof of his net . ' i remember thinking ` i 've messed up here ' . but we ended up winning 4-1 and i think __durie__ scored three . but you can get egg on your face ... '

' neilson believes his side 's 2-1 stoppage-time win at ibrox against rangers on the opening day of the season set the tone for a fine campaign . but it was n't until a battling 2-1 victory at queen of the south on february 21 that he truly believed his side was destined to win the league and return to the top flight after one season away . ` i do n't think you ever take things for granted until you are over the line , ' he said . ` but i think that queen of the south game was a big one for us away from home . we went a goal behind and we had to fight back to get all three points . we eventually got there and , from then on , i thought we had a real chance of taking the league . ` but that win against rangers on the opening day was a huge one for us in terms of morale and also for our fans . a lot of times you can go to ibrox , go ahead and then rangers draw level and you 're then hoping to hang on for a draw . hearts ' __genero__ __zeefuik__ celebrates after giving his side two-goal lead against falkirk . the hearts players celebrate as they beat falkirk and edged closer to an impressive title win . ` but we went straight up the park and scored again to get all three points and that set the tone for the whole season . it gave us a real belief we could go on to win the trophy and now we 've done it . ` to finally get over the line is magnificent . the players have worked so hard and i could n't have asked for more . ` we can now speak to players we want to get from outside the club and speak to players at the club and try to renegotiate . we 've got guys who have been fantastic for us and we want to keep hold of them . ` it 's just a great day and it 's testament to the support we 've had all season from the fans , the hard work of -lrb- owner -rrb- ann budge and -lrb- director of football -rrb- craig __levein__ and all the players . ` the fans in particular have been magnificent and they deserve to have a great night and a great few weeks .

' 2014 was a difficult year for andy because he was returning from back surgery and any kind of surgery you just do n't recover quickly from , ' said judy murray , speaking at the sse arena at wembley , where she is a mentor for sse 's next generation programme , which provides vital financial and development support to 100 young athletes from across the uk and ireland . ` but i think when it 's in your back it takes a long time to get it to the stage where you can put it through what you need to , to play tennis at the very top level and i think once he got into the back end of the season he finished it very strong . ` he won three tournaments , he qualified for the end of year finals and finished the year at six in the world , which is an incredible achievement considering he had what he would say was an inconsistent season . amelie mauresmo watches murray during practice in miami . ` but then he had a really good off season with his coach amelie mauresmo and played incredible tennis all the way through australia and the preparation events . ` that was a really good sign and it was good to see him back moving well and happy and healthy and playing his best tennis . ` and i think we saw some of his best tennis again at indian wells , which was great to see , so i think he 's back on track and he 's happy and he 's healthy . ' murray is hopeful of adding to his coaching team this week ; with the appointment of former world number four jon __bjorkman__ . the swede will join as an assistant to amelie mauresmo sometime after he finishes his involvement in a swedish television dance show . the arrival of __bjorkman__ to team murray is timely after djokovic dismantled the world no. 4 at indian wells ; the defeat sparked a twitter row with a disgruntled fan and highlighted the urgent improvements needed if the scot is to challenge for grand slam titles again . but mum judy has called on fans to be patient as murray __rebuilds__ his career ; while she is convinced another major title is only just around the corner . ' i think you have to remember that novak is the best player in the world presently and no match against him is ever going to be easy , ' she added . ` andy made the semi-finals of the french open last year and has a good game for clay because he is a great athlete and has a great engine on him . ` growing up , we trained a lot on clay in barcelona . he played a lot on hard courts in scotland , albeit indoors , so that will always be in my opinion his best surface . ` the grass season is very short and less of the top players play well on grass because they do n't have grass courts in their country , so they are not used to it . ` so i think grass always presents itself a big opportunity for any british player . ` but i think andy 's goal is the same as it was when he was a little boy , he wants to win grand slams and he wants to be the best . ` he has a very good record in grand slams over the last four or five years so he will be out there and doing his best .

' i think that 's a bad mentality to have , when you think he 's going to be back leading the team in a couple of weeks ' time . ' cook led england to a champions trophy final on home soil two years ago , and the top of the world rankings , but their recent one-day international record under him deteriorated . vaughan added : ` alastair cook 's last six captaincy jobs in -lrb- odi -rrb- series for england , he lost every single one . ` the only series they 've won was away in the west indies , when he was n't the captain . ' michael vaughan claims cook is ` bitter ' about the decision to replace him as captain . cook could only watch from afar as england beat only scotland and afghanistan in their world cup campaign under morgan , but he sensed they were ` shell-shocked ' and in need of ` real leadership ' . vaughan argues cook must move on , and start scoring __prolifically__ again - as he has for the vast majority of his record-breaking career . ' i do n't think it 's great that the captain comes out and criticises the leadership of the captain that takes over - but he 's clearly bitter . ` he 's got to clear that out of his head , because it 's so important that by the time he gets to the west indies england need him scoring runs . ` he has to score runs in the caribbean ; he has to get runs against new zealand - so by the time the ashes arrive in july , no one is talking about alastair cook 's position in the test team . ` he has n't scored a hundred in any format of the game for two years . that has to change in the west indies .

' pietersen has hinted he could change his ipl contract in a bid to push for an england place . both whitaker and ecb managing director paul downton -- the man behind last year 's controversial sacking -- have repeatedly insisted pietersen will never play for england again , a fate that appeared to have been sealed by the publication in october of his __score-settling__ autobiography . but pietersen , desperate to add his __england-record__ tally of __13,797__ runs and 32 centuries , seized on a stray comment made this month by new ecb chairman colin graves , who said the ` first thing he has to do if he wants to get back is start playing county cricket ' . but graves was simply stating the obvious : affiliation to a county is the minimum requirement for anyone with england hopes . but , emboldened by what he regarded as the first stage of a peace offering , pietersen took every opportunity to state his desire to play for england once more . after playing for the big bash league 's melbourne stars , pietersen has signed with the __sunrisers__ hyderabad . surrey were initially wary of resuming ties with a cricketer who turns 35 in june but pietersen has often been at his best when he has had a point to prove . and the prospect of a __hatful__ of division two runs as surrey push for promotion prompted director of cricket alec stewart to bring him into a middle order alongside sri lankan veteran kumar sangakkara . county bowlers may not agree , but the move is a smart one . as long as whitaker , downton , coach peter moores and cook remain in situ , it is inconceivable that pietersen can resume his international career . but assuming he manages to extricate himself from his # 200,000 ipl deal with __sunrisers__ hyderabad , as well as a contract with st lucia __zouks__ in the caribbean premier league , that means he could be available for most , if not all , of the county season . the nightmare scenario for the ecb officials who have stated their position so unequivocally is a glut of runs for the man they continue to consider persona non __grata__ . kumar sangakkara appeared to confirm pietersen 's return to surrey this season after sri lanka bowed out of the world cup with a convincing defeat by south africa . the call from his many fans on social media for pietersen 's return would grow -- especially if england fail to put a disastrous world cup behind them as they embark on an absurd programme of 17 tests in 10 months . on wednesday pietersen told tms : ` if i can do anything that can help me get back into it for england then it 's something i want to do . i love playing for england . ' his best hope is the sacking of all the men who object to him -- and for that to happen england would need to perform terribly in the ashes . in other words , the only plausible scenario that can rescue pietersen is one he can not be seen to hope for . not for the first time , english cricket and kevin pietersen find themselves engaged in a tense __catch-22__ . pietersen has not played for england since the ashes tour of 2013-14 after which he was dropped .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  make no mistake . a first trophy as celtic manager was a huge , significant step for ronny deila . he took the old cup from rod stewart , skipped down the hampden steps and refused to let go until the ` ronny roar ' -- his ceremonial bonding session with the club 's supporters . but this was a day when sobriety was the parkhead __watchword__ . sober reflection , followed by a sober celebration . celtic 's first league cup since 2009 is the platform for deila to become only the third celtic boss to win a domestic treble . but that 's it . a piece in the jigsaw , no more . the celtic players celebrate on the podium with the __qts__ scottish league cup after beating dundee united 2-0 at hampden park . celtic manager ronny deila gets ready to lift the scottish league cup with his players as the __bhoys__ kicked off their celebrations . a scottish cup replay against dundee united -- who else ? -- beckons on wednesday and that ensured there was no prospect of glasgow 's fast-food outlets cashing in on a celtic team session last night . the players , captain scott brown included , were under orders to be in bed by midnight . ` we should enjoy the moment , ' said a relieved deila after an eventful , if unremarkable , final . ` but there is not going to be any nightlife . ' we should have known brown would be a key figure here again . the celtic skipper escaped punishment for the tackle which triggered two red cards -- both rescinded -- when these teams met at tannadice last week . his manager then overlooked the front-page pictures of a night of __rabble-rousing__ in edinburgh before the final . yet the greatest __let-off__ of all might have been here when referee bobby madden denied united -- who ended the game with 10 men and a strong sense of injustice - a penalty kick . popstar and devoted celtic fan rod stewart hands celtic captain scott brown the trophy after the 2-0 victory over dundee united . scott brown lifts the scottish league cup alongside keeper craig gordon -lrb- right -rrb- after a difficult week in the headlines . celtic captain scott brown takes a selfie with a unusual phone case in hand as he captures the moment at hampden park . kris commons -lrb- left -rrb- , who scored celtic 's first after 28 minutes , poses with the scottish league cup trophy on sunday . dundee united -lrb- __4-3-2-1__ -rrb- : __cierzniak__ 7 ; dillon 6 , morris 6 , __fojut__ 6 , dixon 5 ; paton 6 -lrb- erskine 72 -rrb- , butcher 6 , rankin 6 ; mcgowan 6 , dow 6 ; __bilate__ 6 -lrb- __anier__ 59 -rrb- . subs not used : __szromnik__ , __souttar__ , __telfer__ , connolly , __spittal__ . booked : mcgowan . sent off : dillon . celtic -lrb- 4-2-3-1 -rrb- : gordon 6 ; ambrose 7 , van dijk 7 , denayer 7 , izaguirre 7 , __bitton__ 8 -lrb- henderson 81 -rrb- , brown 7 ; stokes 7 , johansen 7 , commons 7 -lrb- forrest 67 -rrb- ; griffiths 7 -lrb- guidetti 67 -rrb- . subs not used : zaluska , scepovic , fisher , mcgregor . goals : commons 28 , forrest 79 . referee : bobby madden . attendance : __49,259__ . __motm__ : __nir__ __bitton__ . celtic were ahead at the time . they had exploited their opponents being down to 10 men when skipper sean dillon collided with virgil van dijk and left the pitch in 23 minutes to receive stitches . he was gone for fully eight minutes . ` i was about to make a change because it seemed to be taking too long , ' said manager jackie mcnamara afterwards . ` it proved costly for us . ` i had blair __spittal__ ready to come on and i was going to put ryan mcgowan to right-back . unfortunately , i do n't have a magic wand for those circumstances . ' dillon would eventually leave the pitch on a permanent basis in the second half for a reckless challenge on emilio izaguirre in 56 minutes . thereafter , celtic dominated , scoring again through james forrest and emphasising why the __tayside__ club were so willing to wait for their captain when he left the pitch for lengthy treatment . he was n't to blame for the __insipid__ paul dixon free-kick which allowed craig gordon to gather and trigger a celtic counter . but it was from his position that anthony stokes -- who had a fine game - chipped a left-foot cross that was prodded towards goal by kris commons , changing direction as it came off the inner thigh of __jaroslaw__ __fojut__ . somehow __rado__ __cierzniak__ in the united goal clawed it brilliantly on to the post , but commons would not be denied , thumping the rebound emphatically into the net with his right foot for 1-0 . ` hindsight is a wonderful thing , ' pondered mcnamara . ` if we had scored from that dixon free-kick , everyone would be saying it was a great decision not to substitute him and give him a little more time . ' there was more cause for united regret in 36 minutes when ryan dow , chasing a through ball into the area was pushed in the back by brown , a __villainous__ figure through tannadice eyes . referee madden had a good , long look then decided to turn the other way . brown had ducked sfa punishment last weekend and here was the cause of another tannadice gripe against authority . not without justification , it should be said . james forrest curls in the second goal for ronny deila 's side as the scottish premiership leaders proved their superiority at hampden park . john guidetti -lrb- left -rrb- , on loan from manchester city , celebrates forrest 's strike for the hoops as they beat dundee united . celtic manager ronny deila urges his side to remain focused as they continue to chase a domestic treble . forrest roars in celebration with the celtic fans at hampden park erupting after deila 's team prevailed 2-0 in the scottish league cup final . predictably , deila -- perhaps seeing it through green and white shades -- saw things differently . ` it was hard to say , but , from what i have been told , it was a good decision , ' he claimed . ` i think the referee was very good . we are after him whenever he does something wrong , but you have to give them credit when they do a good job . ' in contrast , united __foamed__ with frustration and knew they were done for when they went down to 10 men in 56 minutes . last sunday , paul paton and dixon were sent packing . paton 's proved to be a nonsense , but dillon 's here was __inarguable__ . the defender lunged into a dangerous challenge on izaguirre . the honduran was fortunate to escape serious injury . on the united touchline mcnamara raged with the perceived injustice of it all . his side had lost the scottish cup final against st johnstone last may and they knew , now , another showpiece occasion was slipping away . celtic 's extra man was telling . dundee united captain sean dillon -lrb- right -rrb- is sent off for this late challenge on celtic defender emilio izaguirre . dillon ca n't hide his devastation after the dundee united captain was sent for an early shower having been sent off at hampden park . in stokes , stefan johansen and __nir__ __bitton__ , they had the best players on the pitch . in 67 minutes , johansen got across __fojut__ to jab a leigh griffiths cross towards goal , the ball shaving the post en route to a narrow united escape . it was the last act for griffiths before he made way for john guidetti . james forrest replaced the tiring commons and the substitutes would make quite an impact . forrest and guidetti started brightly enough , the winger sweeping the critical second goal into the net from 16 yards in 78 minutes after the swede teed up a johansen __cut-back__ . their manager was less impressed with the very public falling out as the two __haggled__ over a penalty kick five minutes from time . kris commons managed to fire celtic ahead from an acute angle during the first-half , as deila -lrb- right -rrb- roars in celebration . commons put the __bhoys__ ahead on the half hour mark with his 11th goal of the season in all competitions with celtic . commons is congratulated by his team-mates having put the scottish premiership leaders in front during the league cup final . referee madden showed no hesitation when forrest was pulled back by dixon . ` he was very quick to point to the spot that time , ' said a caustic mcnamara afterwards . forrest grabbed the ball , resisting guidetti 's determined and very vocal efforts to do the same . the winger placed the ball down , then placed a weak effort too close to __cierzniak__ , the united keeper preventing a third goal . an unimpressed deila explained afterwards : ` both of the players who were going to take a penalty , leigh griffiths and kris commons , were off the park . it looks like it was the first to the ball , but i do n't like that they argue about that . forrest earned celtic a penalty late on under this challenge from dundee united 's paul dixon in the closing stages . several celtic players wanted guidetti to take the spot-kick but forrest insisted and eventually missed his penalty . ` it is stupid . that is not the team spirit i want . ' as the final whistle signalled a significant day for the norwegian , guidetti marched straight down the tunnel in a huff , clearly furious . he was retrieved by mikael lustig , possibly on deila 's orders . ` there is a lot of emotion in these situations and strikers , especially , want to score goals , ' he continued . ` again , we have to put the team in front of ourselves . it is something we have work on all the time and learn from through experience . this is not team spirit . it is individual thinking - and i do n't want anything to do with that . ' collectively , celtic have much to excite them . a treble hovers on the horizon . the late night celebrations can wait . keeper craig gordon gets the drinks flowing in the dressing room and sprays champagne at his team-mates . celtic goalkeeper craig gordon poses with the scottish league cup trophy in the winning changing room . celtic boss __eonny__ deila enters the dressing room with a smile on his face after the the __bhoys__ won the scottish league cup final . goalscorers james forrest -lrb- left -rrb- and kris commons -lrb- right -rrb- pose with the scottish league cup final trophy in front of the fans . after a testing week in the headlines for the celtic captain , scott brown holds up the trophy in front of the adoring fans . deila hopes to become the third celtic manager to achieve a domestic treble with the __bhoys__ , having won the league cup on sunday .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  it looks like the aftermath of an earthquake in __suburbia__ . but this broken brickwork is actually the result of a botched building job that brought the house down on a couple 's plan for a basement extension . ed __goldswain__ and his eight months pregnant fiancée __jacquie__ hale fled for their lives when the building cracked in half , escaping from their ground floor flat with their upstairs neighbours as debris fell ` like something out of a disaster movie ' . that was just the start of their nightmare . for although the builders were found by a judge to have been ` incompetent ' and were ordered to pay # __287,000__ damages , the firm is believed to be __insolvent__ , the high court heard . and while the couple had buildings cover , the insurance company has so far refused to pay up . now the pair fear they will never see their money -- and they are still saddled with a 23-year mortgage on the # __345,000__ flat . edward __goldswain__ and his partner jacqueline hale , who was eight months pregnant at the time , were planning to extend their # __345,000__ ground-floor flat into the basement of this property in finchley , north london , when disaster struck . mr __goldswain__ said aims plumbing & building services ltd were paid to do the work , but he and his partner soon noticed cracks appearing in the walls of the edwardian home . after a bout of heavy rain mr __goldswain__ said he noticed the cracks widening dramatically . the pair alerted their upstairs neighbour and all of them were forced to flee as the building fell down into the basement . yesterday 39-year-old investment banker miss hale described how , in ten or 20 seconds , cracks in the wall went from __1cm__ wide to 10cm before one side of the building fell away . the trauma caused her early contractions and she had to be taken to hospital . the baby boy was born unharmed six weeks later . miss hale and marketing manager mr __goldswain__ , 40 , bought the house in finchley , north london , four years ago and decided to extend into the basement . aims plumbing & building services limited began work in september 2012 . it went wrong within two months and the couple sued . last week mr justice __akenhead__ said the ` overwhelming probability ' was that the builders failed to carry out the work with reasonable care and skill . barnet council has demolished the building and made the site safe . and the couple -- who now have a second son -- have been renting as they contest the insurance company 's decision . miss hale said : ` the good news is that we 're happy and healthy and we 've got two lovely kids . ' the judge ordered aims plumbing & building services limited to pay the couple almost # 290,000 for the destruction of their edwardian home . mr __goldswain__ and ms hale were forced to move out of their dream property , along with their neighbour , and subsequent checks by finchley council revealed the house would have to be pulled down . broken home : workers dismantle the property in north london after the botched basement extension . a judge today ruled that it was the builders ' ` incompetence ' which led to the collapse . in tatters : the builders were ordered to pay # 290,000 in compensation to mr __goldswain__ and ms hale , but the couple were told they may not see a penny because the firm has gone bust . all gone : the couple were forced to live a nomadic existence after the house was taken down -lrb- pictured -rrb- , moving through a string of temporary homes , but have now settled in __harpenden__ . there is now nothing more than a hole where their old house used to be , with supporting beams used to keep the neighbouring properties up . edward __goldswain__ and his partner jacqueline hale , who was eight months pregnant at the time , had to run from their flat as the house collapsed . but the court heard aims is ` believed to be __insolvent__ ' , so the couple may well never see any of the money . describing it as ' a sad case ' , the judge said the couple bought a lease of the ground floor of 4 stanhope avenue in 2011 . they needed more space for their growing family and decided to extend into the basement , aims starting work in september 2012 . however , it all went horribly wrong on november 24 2012 after a heavy rain storm , said the judge . cracks which the couple had already noticed began to widen fast and ` they could actually hear the fabric of the house tearing apart ' . the couple and the upstairs tenant , who had a baby , hastily evacuated and watched as the building crumbled . ` deeply shocked ' , mr __goldswain__ and miss hale escaped with little more than the clothes they stood up in , the court heard . they watched as the flank wall first ballooned outwards before collapsing in on itself . the next door house was also badly damaged . heavily pregnant miss hale went into premature labour due to the trauma , although her baby was happily delivered unharmed . the council took emergency steps to __shore-up__ what remained of the building and it has remained derelict ever since . since the destruction of their home , the couple have led a nomadic existence , moving between temporary homes , but have now settled in __harpenden__ . and they suffered yet another blow when they discovered that the loss was not covered by their home insurance . they now face paying off the remaining 23 years of the mortgage , while dealing with the heart-breaking loss of their house , according to the evening standard . the couple 's lawyers argued that aims was ` completely out of its depth ' and ` not competent to do the job which it had been employed to do ' . and the judge ruled : ` the overwhelming probability is that aims failed to carry out their work with reasonable care and skill ' . ` the firm had taken no effective steps to to prop up the flank wall or to lay a concrete floor slab which could have averted disaster . ' however , the judge said aims had ` played no part ' in the case and was believed to be __insolvent__ . the couple also sued engineering firm , __beltec__ limited , who designed the essential structure of the basement extension . however , whilst expressing ` the greatest sympathy ' for the couple , the judge ruled that the company had not been negligent and bore no responsibility for the disaster . aims was ordered to pay # __287,754__ damages - although the couple are likely to face an uphill struggle in getting hold of any of that . denying claims they opted for the cheapest service on offer , miss hale said she considered quotes from a number of builders before selecting aims . she and mr __goldswain__ checked references and chose a firm that said it had carried out basement extensions in the past . she added : ` the builder did have insurance , which i made him get , and checked before he started . i also called the company to make sure he had it . but they also declined to cover him . ' some neighbouring houses were damaged by the collapse , including one that the wall fell against . some of those neighbours ' sued the couple . ` they will be paid , ' miss hale said . ` everyone but us gets paid , basically . '

' he claimed that the militias , the overwhelming majority of which is made up of shiite fighters , have their own surveillance drones . ` we buy them anywhere , ' he said . ` we have our own ... controlled by iraqis . ' a series of us airstrikes north of tikrit , in the vicinity of __beiji__ , in recent weeks has had the indirect benefit of tying down isis forces that might otherwise be operating in defense of tikrit . on wednesday , for example , the us military said it had conducted five airstrikes tuesday near __beiji__ , home of a major oil refinery that isis has sought to capture . that bombing targeted isis combat units and destroyed what the us called an isis ` fighting position , ' as well as an isis armored vehicle . warren said the iraqis are discovering how difficult it can be to carry out ground operations in an urban area . ` we heard quite a bit from the iraqis and some even from the iranians -- some fairly __high-confidence__ statements about how rapidly the operations for tikrit would go , '' warren said . `` we 've seen otherwise . ' ' i think it 's important that the iraqis understand that what would be most helpful to them is a reliable partner in this fight against isil , ' warren said . ` reliable , professional , advanced military capabilities are something that reside very clearly and very squarely with the coalition .
