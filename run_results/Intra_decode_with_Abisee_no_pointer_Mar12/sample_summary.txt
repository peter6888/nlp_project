' i had to change my bed every day because there would be so much skin and my eczema wept so much the sheets got all sticky . ' i __itched__ constantly and there would be blood on the sheets too . it was just permanently painful . ' miss james , who works for a recovery firm in northampton , first suffered from a small flare up aged three . she said : ' i ca n't remember not having eczema . it started in the creases of my arms when i was little . ' the eczema gradually spread over her arms and patches appeared on the back of her knees , followed by her hands , stomach and over her legs . in her teens , the eczema progressed and by aged 15 , it had spread to her neck and her face . she said : ' i was teased for having ` __lovebites__ ' on my neck but it was the eczema . ' i used scarves to try and cover it up but then people thought i was covering the __lovebites__ . ' and while most distraught teenagers would reach for the foundation , miss james had no idea how to use cosmetics . she said : ' i was n't one of those girls who knew how to use make up . i did n't know how to cover it up . ` when i got to college and started going out , i just saw so many girls on nights out who were beautiful and i looked disgusting . ' i just could n't even hide it , so on a bad day i would n't even leave my room . ' i thought it was down to stress with exams . ' miss james ' eczema used to cover her entire body and caused a ` snowstorm ' when she walked . even sat at her desk , miss james was faced with problems . she said : ` at the office i would have to go to the bathroom and have a scratch for 20 minutes . ` my fashion sense went downhill because i could n't wear anything that was n't cotton . ' despite trying countless treatments , nothing worked . skin diseases such as eczema are the most common reason we go to the gp , according to figures from the british skin foundation . the condition , characterised by dry , itchy red skin , is now estimated to affect up to 20 per cent of school children and up to 10 per cent of adults . eczema is an inflammatory condition of the skin characterised by dryness and itching . the skin barrier is unable to function properly , which leads to water loss from the skin , triggering itching . bacteria readily gain entry to the skin - especially if it has been scratched - and cause infection . __moisturisers__ or __emollients__ are the first line in treatment and contain __humectants__ . these contain ingredients that draw water from the lower levels of skin to __rehydrate__ the upper levels and those which prevent further water loss from the surface while the barrier repairs . the inflammation is treated by topical steroids . oatmeal baths have long been recommended for people with sensitive skin conditions including eczema . oats have properties which meant they are able to naturally __moisturise__ the skin and relieve itching . they also contain antioxidants which have an anti-inflammatory effect . ` i 'd used light treatment , different creams , medication , herbal remedies - i 'd tried everything , ' she said . and in desperation to keep her condition at bay , she became reliant on steroid cream , which if used incorrectly , can thin skin and increase the risk of skin infections . miss james said : ` if i had a flare up , i would use the cream all over then it would be at bay for two weeks . ` but when it came back it would be worse than ever . ' eventually , miss james came across the international topical steroid awareness network -lrb- __itsan__ -rrb- which has research showing a link between steroid cream and worsening eczema . ' after discussing with her doctor , miss james stopped using the treatment in may 2014 and is now using other skin creams to calm the eczema . but one of the most surprising and effective treatments she has found is porridge oats . she said : ` now i make a face mask using goat 's milk and porridge oats , it 's really soothing . ' i have __oat__ baths , you just use a pair of old tights to put the oats inside . ` the water looks disgusting but it works for me . ' her home treatment , along with __anti-histamines__ from her gp , have cleared up her eczema on some of her body . she said : ` my face is much better now , and my stomach and legs you ca n't even tell i 've got it . ' however she still has severe eczema on her hands , neck and arms but is hopeful she will have further recovery . despite porridge having helped her , she still wears cotton whenever she can . miss james also credits her the support of her partner of six years , nicola wilson , 26 , with her progress . she said : ` people do n't realise how serious eczema is , they think it 's just red skin that 's a bit itchy ' she said : ` nicola is a teacher so she works long hours and then she comes home and looks after me . ' i ca n't bathe myself because of the condition so she washes me . ` we joke that she 's become my carer . ' however , due to the stress her body is under , and because she scratches patches of eczema on her head , for the past nine months miss james ' hair and eyebrows have been falling out . she now washes her hair just once a week -- with shampoo for thin hair and to stimulate hair growth -- so not to irritate her scalp further and cause more hair loss . she said : ' i have to be careful with my hair as it 's holding on by a thread . i think others in my condition would have shaved their heads . ` it upsets me as i got my hair really long and healthy and then one day it started to fall out . i __back-comb__ it to cover up bald patches . i 'm trying to make the best of it . ' she added : ' i started a blog to document my journey and so many people have been supportive . ` i 'm no longer just the girl with the eczema .

' instead , on learning of gordon 's rapidly deteriorating mental , emotional and physical state , the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab . dr phil stated : ' i do n't think he has any chance of turning this round . left to his own devices he will be dead within the week . ' gordon 's mother , michelle , was by her son 's side as he __alternated__ between compliant and aggressive -- at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed . she described her son as ` at breaking point . ' she said : ` he can not take too much more of not being able to see __kriss__ . he blames himself . he 's torn up and carrying guilt . ` he 's dealing with it by drinking . i 've begged him to stop . i 've tried to help him but he ca n't let go of the guilt .

' their relationship was also very volatile . ` when whitney died nick was left with nothing , so he knew he had to control __krissi__ to get access to the money . she 'd do whatever he told her . ` he was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her . they would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around . ' according to __stepho__ : ` but __krissi__ really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother . she was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her . nick knew this and took advantage of it .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  traveling is meant to be one of the most exciting events in a person 's life . but more and more frustrated australians are ditching their travel plans and spending more time searching than they are on their actual holiday , a new study has found . a survey of 1000 people across the country by travel search engine kayak found that one in four aussies spend the equivalent of more than half their annual leave researching and planning their trip . travel agents ' interests , the overload of information online , hidden costs and fluctuating prices were found to be making __holiday-bookers__ extra cautious with their plans . about 38 per cent of people admitted they spend more time looking for flights and hotels then researching the activities they hope to do on the trip . one in four aussies , like sydney marketing manager sam kelly -lrb- pictured on his last trip to bali -rrb- , spend the equivalent of more than half their annual leave researching and planning their holidays . sydney marketing manager sam kelly , admitted that the number of hours it took him to plan his last trip to bali amounted to two weeks worth of working hours . ' i spend a lot of time - hours and hours - it 's a big process . i do n't go on budget holidays , but i 've saved thousands of dollars by going through this process , ' he told daily mail australia . the 27-year-old said that he spent the time researching potential hotels and destinations by looking at various booking sites and reviews , adding that despite enjoying the process , he found it took up a ` ridiculous amount of time ' . ` it 's the amount of information out there . one website that will do that __legwork__ for you and get you the best hotel prices , show you reviews and airfares all in the one currency - one true source of truth - would be ideal , ' he said . mr kelly admitted that it was during office hours that most of his searching and booking occurred , and he 's not alone . according to kayak 26 per cent of those surveyed from canberra did the same thing - a figure which almost three times the national average . it also found that 31 per cent of people have resorted to completely abandoning their travel plans and bookings due to their frustration . investment banker todd __fortescue__ came close to doing so himself when he and his girlfriend found themselves constantly bickering after becoming frustrated with travel agents helping them with their trip to canada earlier this year . the 27-year-old said there was an information overload online and admitted that he did a lot of research for his flights and hotels while at work . instead , the couple ditched their travel agent , choosing to find their own booking deals online . ` we were getting frustrated that we were n't getting anywhere with booking and that it was costing more than we had anticipated and were thinking that maybe we should postpone it for a year when we had more time and knew exactly what we wanted , ' mr __fortescue__ told daily mail australia . ` we went to a travel agent to get assistance and gave them an outline of what we wanted but some of them would give us all these different stories about why they did n't have accommodation in certain areas . it seemed like they were working on commission with hotels because when we looked into the areas ourselves , we found plenty of options . ` there was this constant back and forth of emails and some agents were in different time zones and the more time we wasted the more money we wasted as we got closer to the dates . it was much cheaper when we did it ourselves .

' the move by the caa comes after the authority carried out a six-month review of airline policies in relation to supporting passengers during disruption , including their approaches to paying flight delay compensation and providing information to fliers about their rights . __wizz__ air 's spokesman daniel de carvalho said : ` an application for stay had been made regarding a case in the english courts while the european court of justice is considering a relevant case relating to the extent of airlines ' liability to pay compensation claims in certain cases involving technical faults and defects . ` after this lawful application for stay was denied by english courts , __wizz__ air decided not to appeal this decision and to __re-assess__ the tens of cases where customers claimed compensation after flight disruptions caused by __unforeseeable__ technical faults . ` the uk caa is well aware that __wizz__ air is __re-assessing__ these cases and has confirmed to the uk caa itself , some time ago , that it will apply the uk caa 's own list of extraordinary circumstances in the relevant cases . ` __wizz__ air further confirms that claims can be raised within two years after the flight disruption , in line with its general conditions of carriage agreed to by customers at the time of booking , an approach which has been upheld by the english courts . ' aer lingus denied claims and said their provision of information to customers affected by operational disruption , were ` fully compliant with all the relevant regulations ' andrew haines , chief executive of the caa , said : ` airlines are well aware of the support they must provide when there is disruption and passengers have every right to be disappointed that a small number of airlines are not complying with the court of appeal rulings and continue to let people down in this way . ` since the law was clarified last year , we have been active to ensure airlines are applying consumer law appropriately and i warmly welcome the response of those airlines that have changed their policies as a result of this work . ` our job is not done until all airlines can demonstrate they are providing care , assistance and compensation as required by law . ` while we have no power to secure redress for individual consumers , we are determined to stand up for passengers and are taking this action to safeguard their rights , making sure all airlines consistently provide their passengers with the support and compensation they are legally entitled to .

' knox , 27 , and sollecito , 30 , stand accused of killing the british student in perugia and the italian supreme court is expected to either uphold or quash their convictions today . professor peter gill , a lecturer of forensic genetics at oslo university , norway , looked in-depth at the dna results from the crime scene using the originally analysis by the italian police scientific department and also a second independent analysis ordered by the judge in the first appeal . in an exclusive interview with the daily mail , professor gill admits that the evidence against knox and sollecito is very weak and and compares it to something out of the fictional csi tv series . he said : ` it 's very , very tenuous to use this -lsb- dna -rsb- evidence to link to the conclusion that it proves an activity such as stabbing a victim . if __knoxs__ ' conviction is upheld she could delay going to jail if she were pregnant , according to italian legal experts . there has also been speculation that political pressure from the us could hamper the extradition process . sollecito is reportedly seeking to separate his case from knox 's , with his lawyers pointing out that a partial confession written by the american and later retracted did not mention his presence at the scene of the crime . if that argument succeeds , the italian could be given a new trial . since being convicted sollecito has deserted knox , his one-time lover , and is now insisting that their positions are ` not intertwined ' . his case should have been considered independently of knox 's , he now insists . yesterday bombshell court papers revealed that sollecito claims he does not remember whether knox was with him at the time of ms kercher 's murder . in a dramatic change in legal strategy , sollecito has cast serious doubt on foxy __knoxy__ 's alibi , with the italian now saying he ca n't be sure she was at his house for the whole of the night on which the british student was brutally murdered . all the evidence against the former couple points to knox , sollecito claims in papers filed by his lawyers in advance of the make-or-break supreme court hearing today . ms kercher , a 21-year-old student from coulsdon , surrey , -lrb- left -rrb- was found with her throat slit in her bedroom in perugia in 2007 . knox -lrb- right -rrb- is appealing a decision reinstating what was her conviction for killing kercher . rudy guede is serving a 16-year sentence for his involvement in kercher 's death after a separate trial . the house in perugia where british student meredith kercher was murdered aged just 21 in november 2007 . supporters of amanda knox are convinced that her guilty verdict for murder will be upheld by the italian supreme court when they make their decision later this week . american amanda knox and italian raffaele sollecito both stand accused of killing british student meredith kercher and have been tried three times for the crime . the last hearing , in january last year , again found them guilty . knox 's legal team has been warned that this decision is likely to be rubber-stamped by the supreme court today . people close to the case do not believe ms knox stands a chance in the __hugely-divisive__ case . one supporter said they were prepared for the ` greatest miscarriage of justice ' that has ever happened to a us citizen . in their previous two trials , knox maintained that they were together at sollecito 's flat on the night of the murder after which miss kercher , 21 , was found half-naked with her throat slit in the cottage she shared with knox in perugia , italy . in an __a-z__ of reasons for distancing his position from hers , sollecito 's lawyers are attempting to demonstrate that the evidence used against knox does not concern him . in the __306-page__ paper , sollecito claims that his computer records prove he was watching the japanese manga cartoon __naruto__ at the time of the alleged murder . but he is not sure whether knox was at his house for the whole night as he had been smoking marijuana . the document says : ` the defence intends to emphasise that sollecito has always shown himself to be __extraneous__ to the crime , and has always said that that night he did not move from his own home . however , he did not rule out that knox could have gone out . ' the document also points out that knox , unlike sollecito , had an alleged motive for the murder . emotional : amanda knox breaks down in tears after hearing her 2009 conviction for murdering her british roommate meredith kercher is to be overturned and she will be __acquited__ . amanda knox -lrb- right -rrb- acknowledges the cheers of supporters while her mother __edda__ mellas comforts her on her return home to seattle , washington , in october 2011 after winning an appeal against her conviction . this photo in november 2007 shows knox -lrb- left -rrb- and sollecito together . the pair were 20 and 24 at the time . the report explaining the motivation refers to a statement that rudy guede made to police that miss kercher believed knox stole $ 300 and two credits cards from her . ivory __coast-born__ guede is serving a 16-year jail sentence for his involvement in kercher 's death after a separate trial . judges ruled he did not act alone . sollecito , by contrast with knox , ` had no reason to want the death of meredith kercher .

' torres had gone to mcdonald 's the previous day for a burger but was unhappy to find it did not have bacon on it , as she had requested , police said . after speaking to the managers , they offered her a free bacon burger on her next visit , police said , and after drinking at clubs with a friend that night , she took them up on their offer . sitting in the passenger seat , she headed to the drive-thru at 2am - stopping to chat up a manager at one of the windows before giving him her number , which later helped police track her down . scene : a news report from february 2014 shows the window torres allegedly shot after getting a burger with no bacon inside . her attorney said she shot the gun but did so accidentally . but when she and her friend received their order , she again had no bacon on her burger . on trial : torres , pictured in her mug shot , miraculously did not injure anyone . torres pulled out a handgun and fired once , sending the bullet through the window and out the other side of the restaurant , police said . __beason__ told the jury on tuesday that the gun , which had no safety , went off accidentally . torres ' friend , __nydia__ ray , who was driving the car , told the court her friend had not been upset by the lack of bacon on her burger . she said she saw the gun after handing the order back and was in the middle of saying ` what the f *** is going on ? ' when it fired . the server , essence lake , had walked away from the window when she heard the shot and saw the hole in the glass , she said , adding the bullet would have struck her if she 'd still been by the window . ` we went back and forth screaming and yelling and then we pulled off , ' ray said . the women went to ray 's home but not before a witness wrote down the plate number . police tracked the women down 30 minutes later . grand rapids police officer patrick loeb said ray told him that her friend had been upset over the order . she told him torres said something along the lines of ` do you know who you 're talking to ? ' before she fired - which ray has since denied . the trial will resume on wednesday . caught : torres was found soon after speeding away from the grand rapids mcdonald 's -lrb- pictured -rrb- because she 'd given her number to the restaurant 's manager as she flirted with him before the shooting .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  a mexican mafia hit man convicted of beating and strangling a san antonio woman because she did n't pay the gang 's 10 per cent tax on her illegal drug sales was executed wednesday evening . the injection of manuel vasquez with a lethal dose of pentobarbital leaves texas with enough of the powerful sedative to carry out only one more execution . vasquez was the fourth texas inmate put to death this year , and at least six are scheduled for execution in the coming weeks . texas prison officials , like those in other death penalty states , have found it increasingly difficult to find suppliers to provide drugs intended for capital punishment use . scroll down for video . put to death : gang enforcer manuel vasquez , 46 , was executed wednesday for the ordered murder of a san antonio woman who ignored a 10 per cent street tax on drugs known as a ` dime ' vasquez , 46 , was pronounced dead at __6.32__ pm __cdt__ , 17 minutes after the drug began being administered . vasquez , in a final statement , told his family and friends he loved them and thanked ` the lord for his kind mercy , __faithfulness__ and unconditional love . ' ` in jesus ' name i pray , ' he said , then told the warden : ` i 'm ready . ' he took three deep breaths , then began snoring loudly . the __snores__ became progressively quiet , and all movement stopped within less than a minute . the sister of his victim was among witnesses watching through a window . he never looked at her . his own sister and a female friend cried as they watched in an adjacent room . vasquez 's lawyers filed no late appeals to delay his execution for the 1998 slaying of 51-year-old juanita ybarra . evidence at vasquez 's 1999 capital murder trial showed he and two other men were carrying out orders to kill 51-year-old juanita ybarra for ignoring the mexican mafia 's 10 per cent street tax on drugs -- known as a ` dime . ' ` i 'm sure she was told if you 're selling , you 've got to pay the tax , ' said mary green , an assistant bexar county district attorney who prosecuted vasquez . ' i guess she did n't take it seriously . ' after a night of drinking and drugs at a run-down san antonio motel , vasquez and two companions put on __bandannas__ on their __facesbarged__ into the nearby room of ybarra and her boyfriend , moses __bazan__ , early on march 19 , 1998 , according to evidence presented at his trial . __bazan__ was knocked out in an ensuing struggle but said he saw ybarra being beaten , heard vasquez __holler__ that she was biting him and saw vasquez using a telephone cord to strangle ybarra . the attackers grabbed valuables like cameras and jewelry , stuffed them into a __pillowcase__ and fled . when __bazan__ regained consciousness , he stumbled to the motel office to summon police . he was able to identify at least one of the attackers , leading to the arrest of all three . one of them , johnny joe cruz , took a plea deal that carried a seven-year sentence and testified against vasquez . the third man charged , __oligario__ __lujan__ , is serving a 35-year prison term . court records show the three were carrying out orders from mexican mafia boss rene munoz , who spent years on the texas department of public safety 's 10 most wanted list until his arrest in 2012 . joel perez , vasquez 's lead trial lawyer , recalled last week that the motive for the slaying was ` very detrimental ' . ` we have the texas mexican mafia , and anyone selling drugs they collect a dime - 10 percent , ' he said . ` and the motive in this case was she was n't paying . ' detectives also found the blood of the victims and vasquez 's blood on clothing left in the trunk of a car he used . ` it put him at the scene when he denied being around there , ' mary green , an assistant bexar county district attorney who prosecuted vasquez , said . the lethal injection of manuel vasquez on wednesday evening at huntsville prison in texas would leave t officials in the nation 's most active death penalty state with enough pentobarbital to carry out only one more execution until they are able to obtain a new supply . ' i recall he was an extremely violent individual . in the punishment phase we proved up two other homicides he 'd been involved with . ' vasquez had a lengthy record and had been in and out of prison at least twice . one conviction involved the beating of a man who died after his body was set on fire . records also show vasquez ' father is serving a life sentence for a 1976 murder , and a brother and cousins are or have been in prison . texas ' next execution is scheduled for next week . randall mays is set to die for a 2007 shootout where two east texas sheriff 's deputies were killed . executions set for april in the nation 's most active death penalty state will require a new lethal drug supply to be carried out . some states have started considering other options . utah 's legislature gave final approval tuesday night to a proposal to allow executions by firing squad if there is a drug shortage . legislation to allow firing squads also has been introduced in arkansas , while a wyoming __firing-squad__ measure failed . in oklahoma , lawmakers are considering legislation that would allow the state to use nitrogen gas to execute inmates . ' i remain optimistic we 'll be able to carry out executions according to the schedule , ' brad livingston , executive director of the texas department of criminal justice , has told the associated press . ` time will tell . ' vasquez ' execution is the __522nd__ in texas since the state reinstated capital punishment in 1976 .

' insiders suggested clarkson and mr __tymon__ had given ` quite different ' versions of events . sources close to mr __tymon__ say he was punched and left with a split lip , while clarkson has admitted some ` handbags and pushing ' but is understood to have denied anything worse . the bbc was given a reminder of the strength of support behind clarkson when a __million-strong__ petition calling for his reinstatement was delivered to its headquarters - by tank . the vehicle , apparently driven by the motoring show 's enigmatic professional driver the stig , made its way from westminster , through central london and towards new broadcasting house near oxford street . fans were pictured rallying to support the delivery of the change.org petition , started by political website guido fawkes . there is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take top gear -- worth # 50million a year to bbc coffers -- off the air while the investigation was under way . the petition , launched last week , reads : ` we the __undersigned__ petition the bbc to reinstate jeremy clarkson . freedom to fracas . __#bringbackclarkson__ ' . ' it emerged yesterday that a report into clarkson 's behaviour was commissioned by bbc head of tv danny cohen after a series of other scandals last year . top gear caused an international incident after driving through argentina with a number plate allegedly linked to the falklands war and used the word ` slope ' describe an asian man . a report into the cases apparently concluded that top gear should have a new producer role to act as a go-between the show 's team and the bbc 's management to help deal with any future crisis . the bbc today refused to comment on the report or its conclusions . there is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take top gear -- worth # 50million a year to bbc coffers -- off the air while the investigation was under way . ` the programme could and should have carried on during clarkson 's suspension , ' said an insider . ` jeremy wants to stay with the programme and one possible way of him doing that would be if he could face up to his own shortcomings . ` he has a great deal of public support ... but he does need to rest and sort himself out .

' a postman taking a letter to the door or a printer carrying out a printing job - nobody would say that involved promoting or support , ' he said . ` it 's simply a functional relationship , a working relationship . ' the lawyer also noted the publicity around the case and highlighted that politicians , church figures , bloggers and others had expressed opinions on the matter . but the barrister insisted the case must be judged on the facts alone , saying : ` law must not be determined by those who shout loudest . ' mr allen qc said he was not in court to challenge the mcarthur family 's faith and highlighted that the proposed design would not have had an __ashers__ logo on it . the case is being heard at belfast county court by district judge isobel __brownlie__ . the commission , which monitors compliance with equality laws in the region , has alleged that the stance of the company was in breach of legislation . the case has sharply divided public opinion in northern ireland and beyond . in the wake of the bakery 's refusal to provide the service last may , the commission , a state-funded watchdog body , took on the case on behalf of mr lee . initially , the commission asked the bakery to acknowledge that it had breached legislation and offer ` modest ' damages to the customer . claims of discrimination were made after a __christian-run__ bakery in northern ireland refused to make a cake with a __pro-gay__ marriage slogan on it on religious grounds . pictured , left : the design . pictured , right : belfast councillor andrew muir cutting the cake which was eventually made by another bakery . __ashers__ bakery general manager daniel mcarthur , supported by his wife amy -lrb- right -rrb- , has said he is fighting the case to allow christian business owners to follow their beliefs in how they run their firms . when __ashers__ , which is owned by the mcarthur family , refused , the commission proceeded with the legal action . outlining his view of the facts , mr allen said mr lee had used the bakery in royal avenue in belfast city centre ` regularly ' before the incident . he said his client had seen a leaflet in the shop advertising a service whereby images could be printed in edible icing on a cake . he said there was nothing on the leaflet which suggested a limitation on the service due to ` religious __scruples__ ' . the barrister told the court that the order was accepted by __ashers__ director karen mcarthur and mr lee paid for it in full . ' a contract was therefore concluded , ' he said . mr allen said that , over the next few days , mrs mcarthur expressed concern about the requested cake design with her daughter-in-law , amy , and the matter was then discussed with her son , daniel . after that mr lee was informed that his order would not be processed due to the family 's religious views , said the lawyer . a court was told that for the bakery to refuse to make the cake was like a postman refusing to deliver letters . mr allen said if companies were allowed to break contracts with individuals then ` the law is worth nothing ' . he added : ` the rule of law says there shall be no discrimination in the commercial sphere . ' the barrister insisted that __ashers__ was not an ` explicitly religious ' business and referred to an interview daniel mcarthur gave to a newspaper in which he claimed the majority of his __60-plus__ workforce were unaware of his family 's faith . mr allen stressed the importance of anti-discrimination legislation in northern ireland , given its history of sectarian strife . daniel and amy mcarthur sat on one side of an almost packed courtroom , with mr lee watching from the other side . the __ashers__ case has prompted the democratic unionist party to propose a law change at stormont that would provide an ` equality clause ' which would essentially enable businesses to refuse to provide certain services on religious grounds . mr mcarthur has previously said : mr mcarthur has previously insisting that christians should be able to apply their beliefs to the day-to-day running of their businesses . he said : ' i would like the outcome of this to be that any christians running a business could be allowed to follow their christian beliefs and principles in the day-to-day running of the business and that they are allowed to make decisions based on that . ' the hearing continues . mr mcarthur , with his wife amy and daughter robyn , sat in court today to hear the legal argument .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  when we learn how to write , our brain does not learn the individual lettering of words - instead it is tuned to remember how the word appears as a whole . that 's the finding of a new study that has shown how neurons respond differently to real words compared to so-called ` nonsense ' words . during tests , brain scans revealed the new words appear as shapes rather than a group of letters in what researchers behind the study have dubbed a ` visual dictionary . ' when we learn how to write , our brain does n't learn individual letters , instead it is tuned to remember how the word appears as a whole , according to new research . brain scans revealed neurons respond differently to real words compared to so-called ` nonsense ' words in what 's been dubbed ` visual dictionary ' the study , carried out at georgetown university medical centre , suggests brain is ` __holistically__ tuned ' to recognise complete words , according to the researchers . lead author dr __maximilian__ __riesenhuber__ from the laboratory for computational cognitive neuroscience said : ` we are not recognising words by quickly spelling them out or identifying parts of words , as some researchers have suggested . ` instead , neurons in a small brain area remember how the whole word looks - using what could be called a visual dictionary . ' the small area in the brain called the visual word form area is found in the left side of the visual cortex , opposite the __fusiform__ face area on the right side , which remembers how faces look . the study published in the journal of neuroscience looked at the brain activity of 25 adults who had learn a set of 150 nonsense words . for the research the part of the brain associated with learning was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- fmri -rrb- , before and after participants learnt the new words . using the __fmri-rapid__ adaptation , the team found the visual word form area changed as the participants learned the nonsense words . before learning the words , neurons responded as though the training words were nonsense words . however over time , the neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words . the researchers said this shows the brain is ` __holistically__ tuned ' to recognise complete words , and may also provide insights into how to help people with reading disabilities . dr __riesenhuber__ added : ` one area is selective for a whole face , allowing us to quickly recognise people , and the other is selective for a whole word , which helps us read quickly . ' the study , published in the journal of neuroscience , looked at the brain activity of 25 adults who had learn a set of 150 nonsense words . for the research the part of the brain associated with learning was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- fmri -rrb- . images of the brain were taken before and after participants learnt the new words . from this , the team found the visual word form area changed as the participants learned the ` nonsense ' words . before learning the words , neurons responded as though the training words were nonsense words . but over time , the neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words . co-author dr laurie __glezer__ said : ` this study is the first of its kind to show how neurons change their tuning with learning words , demonstrating the brain 's __plasticity__ . ' the researchers said the study shows how the brain processes words , but may also provide insights into how to help people with reading disabilities . dr __riesenhuber__ said : ` for people who can not learn words by __phonetically__ spelling them out - which is the usual method for teaching reading - learning the whole word as a visual object may be a good strategy . ' in particular , the team found the visual word form area in the __fusiform__ __gyrus__ -lrb- shown in purple -rrb- changed as the participants learned the ` nonsense ' words . the neurons began by responding to the training words as if they were nonsense , but over time , these neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words . following a previous study carried out by the team published in 2009 , the researchers were contacted by a number of people who had experienced reading difficulties and teachers helping people with reading difficulties , all saying that learning word as visual objects had helped a great deal . that study showed the existence of a neural representation for whole written real words - also known as an __orthographic__ lexicon . the latest research now shows how novel words can become incorporated after learning into this lexicon . dr __riesenhuber__ said : ` the visual word form area does not care how the word sounds , just how the letters of the word look together . ` the fact that this kind of learning only happens in one very small part of the brain is a nice example of selective __plasticity__ in the brain .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  joe biden made yet another of his trademark gaffes today as he met ireland 's prime minister to mark st patrick 's day - then suggested one side of its sectarian divide was unwelcome in washington . sporting a green tie and noticing that everyone else was also wearing one , or clad in green , he suddenly blurted : ` anyone wearing orange is not welcome in here . ' the purported joke was a reference to ireland 's religious and political divide which was at the heart of the troubles , the violence which killed 3,000 from the late 1960s until the start of the millennium . orange is the color associated with the protestant majority in northern ireland , and overcoming sectarian tensions has been a major part of the effort to bring peace to the __once-deeply__ troubled province . enda kenny , the irish prime minister -- whose official title is taoiseach -- and his wife __fionnuala__ kenny , the guests of honour , both laughed nervously . they said nothing , but continued to smile for the cameras . scroll down for video . wearing of the green : from left ireland 's prime minister enda kenny , his wife __fionnuala__ and vice-president joe biden . the vice president made a joke about sectarianism and got her name wrong . i 'm with ... : vice president joe biden points at shamrock worn in his breast pocket to mark st patrick 's day . after a brief pause , mr biden declared : ` only joking . ' he then welcomed the __kennys__ , irish ambassador anne anderson and the irish entourage into the naval observatory in washington , his official residence . the vice __pesident__ made no further reference to his __blurted-out__ bad joke , but at one point in his breakfast remarks appeared to refer to the taoiseach 's wife as ` fiona ' , although he subsequently corrected it to __fionnuala__ . northern irish protestants traditionally wear orange during their annual summer parades , while green is used as a symbol by mostly catholic irish nationalists and is a theme of st patrick 's day celebrations around the world . in northern ireland , there was an immediate demand from a senior unionist for an apology . ` whether they were intended as a joke or not , the comments are a slur on those who would be known as ` orange ' i.e. protestants , ' said the rev william mccrea , a member of the british parliament for the democratic unionist party . ` when northern ireland is making such an effort to make st patrick 's day an inclusive celebration , joe biden 's comments were disgraceful and careless , ' he added . asked about the request for an apology , an official in biden 's office said the vice president had made clear that he was joking . biden 's mother , catherine finnegan , was of irish origin . her ancestors had moved to ireland in the wake of the potato famine . the vice president made another minor blunder later when he read a quote from a __yeats__ poem he described as ` easter sunday 1916 ' , when the word sunday is not in the title . the poem was about the easter rising , when irish rebels began a violent attempt to force ireland to become independent from the united kingdom , which succeeded five years later . it actually broke out the next day , easter monday , april 24 of that year . the use of easter sunday would materially affect the subject of the poem , best known for its phrase ' a terrible beauty is born ' . he described __yeats__ as ' a protestant hero in a predominantly catholic country . ' he then told the taoiseach : ` you 've become a close friend and i admire you a great deal . ' laughing : despite the gaffe , irish prime minister enda kenny laughed with mr biden . mr biden also revealed that he had a __stammer__ as a child . ` my uncle , ed finnegan , a bachelor , used to sleep in the same room as my brother and i. i used to stutter very badly when i was a kid . but at night ed used to recite the poetry of __yeats__ . and i would get up and recite in front of a mirror , and try to learn not to __contort__ my face when i spoke and __stuttered__ . ' mr biden has a long list of previous gaffes -- he once asked a wheelchair-bound local politician to stand up and acknowledge the crowd 's applause , and after being chosen as vice president he even suggested that hillary clinton would have been a better choice . most recently he was widely ridiculed for putting his hands on the shoulders of stephanie carter , wife of defense secretary ash carter , and whispering in her ear as her husband was sworn in . he also told the father of a teenage girl -- utah republican senator orrin hatch 's __grandaughter__ emily -- that he hoped he had a ` big fence ' as hatch was sworn in . five years ago , biden incorrectly suggested at a st patrick 's day reception that the mother of then irish prime minister brian cowen was dead , saying ` god rest her soul ' , before correcting himself to say ` god bless her soul ' . at today 's washington event the taoiseach presented the vice president with a book of __yeats__ ' poetry , but told him he should not open it for at least another 25 years , ` when you are old and grey and nodding by the fire . ' he then invited mr biden to play a round of golf in ireland - the fifth time he has done so , with no success so far . mr kenny joked : ` the golf courses are still there . and they are in better condition than they have been for many years . so welcome home , finnegan . ' mr biden replied that last year the taoiseach had tried to __intercede__ for him with the president , telling him , ` you got ta let him go . you got ta let joe go . '

' they also note that ejections of material associated with the flare - known as a coronal mass ejection -lrb- cme -rrb- - are predicted to arrive today and tomorrow . ` the combined effects of these storms have prompted a g1 -lrb- minor -rrb- __geomagnetic__ storm watch to be issued , with the possibility of additional or upgraded watches __if/when__ additional data can be analysed , ' they wrote . a __geomagnetic__ storm is a temporary disturbance of earth 's atmosphere , which can cause communication problems . nasa 's solar dynamics observatory -lrb- __sdo__ -rrb- , illustration shown , was launched on 11 february 2010 and has observed the sun ever since . it 's goal is to understand how exactly the sun interacts with the environment around earth . it captured the images of this latest large flare . according to the us space weather prediction centre -lrb- __swpc__ -rrb- in boulder , colorado , the flare -lrb- shown -rrb- caused an hour-long blackout in some high-frequency radio __communicatiosn__ over some areas . a solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots . their frequency varies from several a day , when the sun is particularly active , to less than one a week during quiet periods . radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from radio waves at the long wavelength end , through optical emission to x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end . the amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of __100-megaton__ hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time . solar flares are not to be confused with coronal mass ejections -lrb- __cmes__ -rrb- . the former are the flash of light from the sun , while the latter are the actual emission of material that we often see as ` loops ' coming from the surface . while the two often accompany each other , the relationship between them is not entirely understood .

' i just looked around and thought this is absolutely crazy - i can not believe this is happening right now . ` we do all sorts of activities from __show-and-tell__ to __dress-up__ ; we also play with play-doh have snack and nap time . ` it really is a preschool for adults and everybody loves it . ' the classes , which are priced between $ 333 and $ 999 for a month-long course , depending on what each adult is able to pay , have been taking place once a week throughout the month of march , and are scheduled during the evenings , so that any working adult participants are still able to attend , after completing a full day at the office . and , just like a traditional preschool , pupils get the chance to enjoy a class picture day , a slumber party and even a parents ' evening where they can show off their work . ` it 's amazing , we say `` it 's snack time '' and everyone is like `` yay , snack time '' - then its nap time and everybody cuddles up together in a ball , ' michelle added . ` they totally get into it -- it 's really great getting in there and making things with play-doh and loving it . ' interestingly , the adults who attend michelle 's classes confess that they feel no embarrassment about taking the opportunity to revert back to their childhood selves - and some even insist that the classes serve as a perfect way of inject more fun into their lives . put it all together : the classes are run by michelle -lrb- pictured -rrb- , who goes by the name of miss joni during school hours . daring duo : michelle -lrb- r -rrb- and her assistant miss __cancan__ -lrb- l -rrb- both have a background in early child development . __tuneful__ melody : the preschool program also includes music lessons for participants . lawyer amanda __devereux__ , 33 is one such participant , and admitted that she attends the classes because they provide her with a forum in which she can try new things and experience some of the fun she used to enjoy as a child . ` i 'm a __litigator__ , i deal with securities litigation and complex commercial cases , ' she explained . ` this is definitely a contrast from my job but i would like to think i 'm a lot like i was when i was a child . ' i still like to have fun and try new things . ` my family are really into the idea and my work colleagues are not surprised i 've taken the class . ` my mother just sent me a sweater for -lsb- my -rsb- class picture day with a note saying she used to pick out my clothes when i was four , so why not now ? ' along with lawyers from the corporate sector , the class also attracts mothers who want a break from their everyday obligations at home . sarah __fader__ , 35 , an author and mother-of-two , explained that attending the quirky preschool allows her to embrace her own inner child , after spending a day looking after the needs of her own children at home . ` being a mom and taking care of children is very taxing , ' she said . ' i wanted to get back to that feeling of freedom and childlike fun and wonder that i used to have . ` my children are seven and four and doing this grown up preschool reminds me of what it must be like as a child and helps me become a better parent . ' free and fun : michelle believes that the classes serve as a form of therapy for the adults . artistic expression : the adult attendees are even allowed to finger paint on the walls . secret success : michelle believes that each pupil at her preschool needs the chance to escape from their adult obligations . preschool mastermind creator michelle believes that , for many of her participants , the classes serve as a form of therapy , allowing adults to deal with their real world problems from the point of view of their inner child . ` my hope is that everyone who participates in preschool mastermind really comes out with a new sense of looking at the world with curiosity , with imagination and they are able to see things differently , ' she said . ` part of this is finding the secret to getting adults to get out of their normal routine and start playing more . ' with parents day currently on the horizon , michelle added that all of her pupils are being encouraged to bring along their own parents , or their friends and family members , to share with them everything that they have achieved during their classes . ` on parents day they will either have their parents or their friends here and they 'll get to show off in a big __show-and-tell__ showcase , ' michelle added . but while michelle 's classes have gone down a storm with her pupils , they have also , perhaps unsurprisingly , garnered some unwanted attention from prospective pupils who have misunderstood exactly what the classes are about . ` we have had some adults inquiring about changing diapers and if this is all about adult baby play - but that is not what this is , ' michelle explained . ` there is nothing sexual about this class it 's just fun . ` there are some people that think this is a waste of time and a waste of money - they say they can finger paint on their own . ` to them i would say go and finger paint on your own -- i hope you do . freedom of expression : according to michelle , the participants at her preschool are looking to find ` more magic in life ' select group : michelle admitted that the classes have received some criticism , but added that she is aware her preschool program ` is not for everybody ' ` it 's fine that people criticise this -- it 's not for everybody . ` people come because they want to stop being so serious all the time and want to learn and have that fun come to them and they want to find more magic in life . ' while the classes might seem like a bit of a folly for pupils , both michelle , and her assistant miss __cancan__ , boast an impressive background in early child development - and both have experience in preschool education . ` something you may not know about me is that i have nearly half a degree in early childhood education , ' michelle explains on her website . ' i wanted to be a preschool teacher for many years , so that is what i originally went to college for ! i love __preschoolers__ , and we connect on a serious level . ` but then i realized that career path meant being chained to a classroom and told that my butt ca n't show ... so i switched to fashion merchandising . ' she adds : ' -lsb- miss __cancan__ -rsb- used to be a preschool teacher abroad and has fantastic insights , puns , a master 's in teaching , and imagination . ' but despite her enthusiasm for the class and her pupils , michelle remains realistic about how some people will view her grown up preschool . she added : ` for those of you who say this is a weird thing to do , i would say you are probably right .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  students preparing for college campus tours can now make the task easier by hopping on a private jet and visiting schools - but it will cost $ __43,500__ . the price is nearly the same as the $ __43,938__ undergraduate tuition at harvard -lrb- that 's not including room and board -rrb- . the __ten-hour__ flight cards offered by __magellan__ jets , a company that provides private travel services , also include perks like car services to transport clients to and from each campus . in its second year of running the offer , the company said last year 18 people purchased the cards , and each made around three or four college visits in one day . families can pay $ __43,500__ to have a private jet help their college hopeful make multiple college visits into a short period of time -lrb- above file photo -rrb- . this year , they are expecting 50 buyers of the package , which is offered from march 25 - june 30 , a __magellan__ spokeswoman told cnbc . ` there is a little bit of a misconception with private jets that it 's all glitz and glamour , but the real reason people use them is productivity and efficiency , ' greg __belezerian__ , vice president at __magellan__ told __marketwatch__ . ` this is a tool that our clients use in order to be more efficient . i know that might sound weird , but that 's really why they 're using it . ' while data from last year revealed that over the past three decades the average tuition at a public four-year college had more than tripled , most families are likely looking at financial aid options before considering __splurging__ on a chartered jet to visit campuses . but for those who can afford to dish out the money , __magellan__ said its college tour service was created as a way to help alleviate the stress that often comes with campus visits , according to cnn money . __belezerian__ said the idea came from clients who were already using their services for college tours so they just met the demand . last year , he told business insider that through the service , a student can visit up to eight campuses in different cities in one weekend . he said they were able to take one student to visit northwestern , duke , and syracuse in one day . this year they have already taken a few clients on tours . greg __belezerian__ , a vice president at __magellan__ , said there is a misconception with private jets being all ` glitz and glamour ' but that the real reason people use them is for efficiency -lrb- above students on a college tour at saint michael 's college -rrb- . the company organizes a flight schedule based on the schools a client wants to visit , then sets up the car services , while some times even coordinating private tours of college towns with local __chauffeurs__ . if a family using the service can not fit in all of the schools they wanted to visit using the __ten-hour__ card , they have to purchase additional cards . following each visit , their client is given a notepad from each college they toured so they can write their feedback . __magellan__ puts together all of the notes and sums up their client 's reaction from each school . and once the college hopeful chooses a school , they receive a gift basket from the company filled with branded items from the institution . mimi doe , co-founder of application boot camp , which offers a $ 16,000 four-day course for students to complete their college applications , said she is surprised there are not more __concierge-style__ college visiting services . she told __marketwatch__ : ` it 's clunky to visit schools . there should be a __hotel/private__ __plane/car__ service that 's all connected . '
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: __magellan__ jets offers __ten-hour__ flight cards for clients to go on college visits while also offering car services . previously , company said a student can visit up to eight campuses in different cities during one weekend . last year , a client visited northwestern , duke , and syracuse in one day .

' i had to change my bed every day because there would be so much skin and my eczema wept so much the sheets got all sticky . ' i __itched__ constantly and there would be blood on the sheets too . it was just permanently painful . ' miss james , who works for a recovery firm in northampton , first suffered from a small flare up aged three . she said : ' i ca n't remember not having eczema . it started in the creases of my arms when i was little . ' the eczema gradually spread over her arms and patches appeared on the back of her knees , followed by her hands , stomach and over her legs . in her teens , the eczema progressed and by aged 15 , it had spread to her neck and her face . she said : ' i was teased for having ` __lovebites__ ' on my neck but it was the eczema . ' i used scarves to try and cover it up but then people thought i was covering the __lovebites__ . ' and while most distraught teenagers would reach for the foundation , miss james had no idea how to use cosmetics . she said : ' i was n't one of those girls who knew how to use make up . i did n't know how to cover it up . ` when i got to college and started going out , i just saw so many girls on nights out who were beautiful and i looked disgusting . ' i just could n't even hide it , so on a bad day i would n't even leave my room . ' i thought it was down to stress with exams . ' miss james ' eczema used to cover her entire body and caused a ` snowstorm ' when she walked . even sat at her desk , miss james was faced with problems . she said : ` at the office i would have to go to the bathroom and have a scratch for 20 minutes . ` my fashion sense went downhill because i could n't wear anything that was n't cotton . ' despite trying countless treatments , nothing worked . skin diseases such as eczema are the most common reason we go to the gp , according to figures from the british skin foundation . the condition , characterised by dry , itchy red skin , is now estimated to affect up to 20 per cent of school children and up to 10 per cent of adults . eczema is an inflammatory condition of the skin characterised by dryness and itching . the skin barrier is unable to function properly , which leads to water loss from the skin , triggering itching . bacteria readily gain entry to the skin - especially if it has been scratched - and cause infection . __moisturisers__ or __emollients__ are the first line in treatment and contain __humectants__ . these contain ingredients that draw water from the lower levels of skin to __rehydrate__ the upper levels and those which prevent further water loss from the surface while the barrier repairs . the inflammation is treated by topical steroids . oatmeal baths have long been recommended for people with sensitive skin conditions including eczema . oats have properties which meant they are able to naturally __moisturise__ the skin and relieve itching . they also contain antioxidants which have an anti-inflammatory effect . ` i 'd used light treatment , different creams , medication , herbal remedies - i 'd tried everything , ' she said . and in desperation to keep her condition at bay , she became reliant on steroid cream , which if used incorrectly , can thin skin and increase the risk of skin infections . miss james said : ` if i had a flare up , i would use the cream all over then it would be at bay for two weeks . ` but when it came back it would be worse than ever . ' eventually , miss james came across the international topical steroid awareness network -lrb- __itsan__ -rrb- which has research showing a link between steroid cream and worsening eczema . ' after discussing with her doctor , miss james stopped using the treatment in may 2014 and is now using other skin creams to calm the eczema . but one of the most surprising and effective treatments she has found is porridge oats . she said : ` now i make a face mask using goat 's milk and porridge oats , it 's really soothing . ' i have __oat__ baths , you just use a pair of old tights to put the oats inside . ` the water looks disgusting but it works for me . ' her home treatment , along with __anti-histamines__ from her gp , have cleared up her eczema on some of her body . she said : ` my face is much better now , and my stomach and legs you ca n't even tell i 've got it . ' however she still has severe eczema on her hands , neck and arms but is hopeful she will have further recovery . despite porridge having helped her , she still wears cotton whenever she can . miss james also credits her the support of her partner of six years , nicola wilson , 26 , with her progress . she said : ` people do n't realise how serious eczema is , they think it 's just red skin that 's a bit itchy ' she said : ` nicola is a teacher so she works long hours and then she comes home and looks after me . ' i ca n't bathe myself because of the condition so she washes me . ` we joke that she 's become my carer . ' however , due to the stress her body is under , and because she scratches patches of eczema on her head , for the past nine months miss james ' hair and eyebrows have been falling out . she now washes her hair just once a week -- with shampoo for thin hair and to stimulate hair growth -- so not to irritate her scalp further and cause more hair loss . she said : ' i have to be careful with my hair as it 's holding on by a thread . i think others in my condition would have shaved their heads . ` it upsets me as i got my hair really long and healthy and then one day it started to fall out . i __back-comb__ it to cover up bald patches . i 'm trying to make the best of it . ' she added : ' i started a blog to document my journey and so many people have been supportive . ` i 'm no longer just the girl with the eczema .

' the researchers found homeopathic treatments were no more effective than sugar pills and other control , pretend medicines to treat asthma , migraines , stress and colds . homeopathy is a form of complementary , holistic medicine used by more than 200 million people across the world . advocates advise it is used for both acute and chronic conditions . it is based on the principle of ` like cures like ' , the british homeopathic association states . the idea is that substances that cause illnesses can become remedies in small , highly diluted doses . the bha advise it can be used to treat eczema , depression , coughs , the menopause , chronic fatigue , irritable bowel syndrome , hay fever , crohn 's disease , multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis and asthma . there were signs it was more effective than __placebos__ for adhd , bruising , hiv , chronic fatigue , ulcers and depression . but the council concluded the experiments were not carried out properly and the results were not very reliable . for a treatment to be considered effective , the council 's homeopathy working committee advised it must result in health improvements that can not be explained by the placebo effect , and these health improvements must be meaningful for a person 's overall health . there must also be evidence that the health improvements in people taking the treatment are unlikely to be due to chance and the result must be seen consistently in several studies , the council 's report said . professor anderson concluded : ` from this review , the main recommendation for australians is that they should not rely on homeopathy as a substitute for proven , effective treatments . ` this statement was the result of a rigorous examination of the evidence and used internationally accepted methods for assessing the quality and reliability of evidence for determining whether or not a therapy is effective for treating health conditions . ' homeopathic remedies are prepared by taking a substance , plant , animal or chemical material , __diluting__ it in water or alcohol , then forcefully hitting the container against a hand or surface . the medicines come in the form of pellets to be placed under the tongue , tablets , liquids , __ointments__ , sprays and creams . the australian health council assessed the effectiveness of homeopathic medicines based on three criteria . in the first instance , they looked at a review of past studies , carried out by an independent contractor . the council found there is no conclusive evidence that homeopathy is more effective than __placebos__ in treating patients and easing their symptoms . advocates of the alternative medicine say it is useful in treating a range of illnesses , including multiple sclerosis , colds , coughs as well as irritable bowel syndrome . in addition , experts considered an independent evaluation of information provided by homeopathy interest groups and the public . and finally , the council took into consideration clinical practice guidelines and government reports on homeopathy , published in countries across the world . __cristal__ sumner , chief executive of the british homeopathic association said the australian council 's report ` seriously __misrepresents__ the nature of the clinical research evidence in homeopathy ' . ` the __nhmrc__ 's conclusion fails to caution that the review admitted that `` the evidence base for the majority of clinical conditions was considered of insufficient size to enable clear conclusions on the efficacy of homeopathy to be drawn '' , ' she said . ` moreover , the review 's focus on medical conditions fails to recognise that homeopathy is based on __individualised__ treatment , not on a named medical condition . ' a recent __meta-analysis__ published by the british homeopathic association has provided independently verified evidence that individually prescribed homeopathic medicines may have clinical effects that are greater than those of __placebos__ . ` the __nhmrc__ 's statement also fails to note that its review commended further quality research in homeopathy .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  unmasked : jihadi john has been identified as mohammed emwazi . a charity that funded the human rights group which described jihadi john as a ` beautiful young man ' has been forced to halt further donations . the joseph rowntree charitable trust had made six-figure donations to cage , but links with the ` warped ' campaign group prompted outrage from westminster and the threat of a charity commission inquiry . the mail has also highlighted criticism of cage and its pronouncements about jihadi john , identified as mohammed emwazi , for the past week . last night the rowntree trust reluctantly agreed to stop bankrolling cage after officials at the charity commission -- furious over cage 's support for the is killer -- threatened a statutory inquiry into its leadership if it refused to give ` unequivocal assurances ' it would withdraw funding . cage caused outrage last week over its attempts to justify the killings meted out by __kuwaiti-born__ briton emwazi , because he had claimed to have been harassed by mi5 . the campaign group gave an extraordinary press briefing about emwazi -- carried live at length on the bbc and sky -- after he was identified as the man behind the mask of jihadi john . asim qureshi , its research director , described one of the world 's most wanted terrorists as a ` beautiful young man ' , ` extremely gentle ' and ` the most humble young person that i ever knew ' . the 32-year-old blamed british security services for emwazi 's radicalisation , saying he had tried to fit in but had been made to feel like an ` outsider ' . and on thursday night , qureshi was a guest on bbc1 's this week , which appeared to expose him as a cheerleader for jihad . scroll down for video . when presenter andrew neil confronted him with a previous interview in which he had appeared to support executing __adulterers__ by stoning , he refused to give a straight confirmation or denial , instead repeatedly stating : ` i 'm not a __theologian__ .

' the charity commission started investigating both the rowntree and roddick charities over their funding of cage in 2013 . much of the rest of its income comes from cash donations from muslims . last week lord carlile , a former independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation , said : ` cage is an organisation with a warped view . no sensible person should be funding it . ' sources at the charity commission believe officials at rowntree may have been ` duped ' when they agreed to support cage . the mail has highlighted criticism of cage and its pronouncements about jihadi john , identified as mohammed emwazi , for the past week . in a statement rowntree said : ` in the last week we have been put under intense regulatory pressure to rule out any future funding of cage . ` in the light of regulatory pressure , and to protect the interests of all our __grantees__ and the other work of the trust , we have decided to confirm we will not fund cage either now or in the future . ' a charity commission spokesman said : ` statements by cage officials heightened concerns about the use of charitable funds to support their activities . in these circumstances , -lsb- we -rsb- required unequivocal assurances from the two charities that they have ceased funding cage and had no intention of doing so in the future . we are glad both the roddick foundation and the joseph rowntree charitable trust have ceased funding cage . ' a cage spokesman said last night : ` we respect their decision . we thank them for their past support . ` both of these charities have played a significant role in contributing to the development of muslim civil society here in the uk .

' their relationship was also very volatile . ` when whitney died nick was left with nothing , so he knew he had to control __krissi__ to get access to the money . she 'd do whatever he told her . ` he was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her . they would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around . ' according to __stepho__ : ` but __krissi__ really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother . she was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her . nick knew this and took advantage of it .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  traveling is meant to be one of the most exciting events in a person 's life . but more and more frustrated australians are ditching their travel plans and spending more time searching than they are on their actual holiday , a new study has found . a survey of 1000 people across the country by travel search engine kayak found that one in four aussies spend the equivalent of more than half their annual leave researching and planning their trip . travel agents ' interests , the overload of information online , hidden costs and fluctuating prices were found to be making __holiday-bookers__ extra cautious with their plans . about 38 per cent of people admitted they spend more time looking for flights and hotels then researching the activities they hope to do on the trip . one in four aussies , like sydney marketing manager sam kelly -lrb- pictured on his last trip to bali -rrb- , spend the equivalent of more than half their annual leave researching and planning their holidays . sydney marketing manager sam kelly , admitted that the number of hours it took him to plan his last trip to bali amounted to two weeks worth of working hours . ' i spend a lot of time - hours and hours - it 's a big process . i do n't go on budget holidays , but i 've saved thousands of dollars by going through this process , ' he told daily mail australia . the 27-year-old said that he spent the time researching potential hotels and destinations by looking at various booking sites and reviews , adding that despite enjoying the process , he found it took up a ` ridiculous amount of time ' . ` it 's the amount of information out there . one website that will do that __legwork__ for you and get you the best hotel prices , show you reviews and airfares all in the one currency - one true source of truth - would be ideal , ' he said . mr kelly admitted that it was during office hours that most of his searching and booking occurred , and he 's not alone . according to kayak 26 per cent of those surveyed from canberra did the same thing - a figure which almost three times the national average . it also found that 31 per cent of people have resorted to completely abandoning their travel plans and bookings due to their frustration . investment banker todd __fortescue__ came close to doing so himself when he and his girlfriend found themselves constantly bickering after becoming frustrated with travel agents helping them with their trip to canada earlier this year . the 27-year-old said there was an information overload online and admitted that he did a lot of research for his flights and hotels while at work . instead , the couple ditched their travel agent , choosing to find their own booking deals online . ` we were getting frustrated that we were n't getting anywhere with booking and that it was costing more than we had anticipated and were thinking that maybe we should postpone it for a year when we had more time and knew exactly what we wanted , ' mr __fortescue__ told daily mail australia . ` we went to a travel agent to get assistance and gave them an outline of what we wanted but some of them would give us all these different stories about why they did n't have accommodation in certain areas . it seemed like they were working on commission with hotels because when we looked into the areas ourselves , we found plenty of options . ` there was this constant back and forth of emails and some agents were in different time zones and the more time we wasted the more money we wasted as we got closer to the dates . it was much cheaper when we did it ourselves . ' hidden costs were found to be one of the highest ranked frustrations for __holiday-bookers__ , worse than fluctuating prices and information overload . overall , kayak found that 86 per cent of the people they surveyed ` spend the same amount of time or more planning and booking holidays than they did three years ago ' , but that more than half reported their holiday satisfaction had declined or stayed the same .

' knox , 27 , and sollecito , 30 , stand accused of killing the british student in perugia and the italian supreme court is expected to either uphold or quash their convictions today . professor peter gill , a lecturer of forensic genetics at oslo university , norway , looked in-depth at the dna results from the crime scene using the originally analysis by the italian police scientific department and also a second independent analysis ordered by the judge in the first appeal . in an exclusive interview with the daily mail , professor gill admits that the evidence against knox and sollecito is very weak and and compares it to something out of the fictional csi tv series . he said : ` it 's very , very tenuous to use this -lsb- dna -rsb- evidence to link to the conclusion that it proves an activity such as stabbing a victim . if __knoxs__ ' conviction is upheld she could delay going to jail if she were pregnant , according to italian legal experts . there has also been speculation that political pressure from the us could hamper the extradition process . sollecito is reportedly seeking to separate his case from knox 's , with his lawyers pointing out that a partial confession written by the american and later retracted did not mention his presence at the scene of the crime . if that argument succeeds , the italian could be given a new trial . since being convicted sollecito has deserted knox , his one-time lover , and is now insisting that their positions are ` not intertwined ' . his case should have been considered independently of knox 's , he now insists . yesterday bombshell court papers revealed that sollecito claims he does not remember whether knox was with him at the time of ms kercher 's murder . in a dramatic change in legal strategy , sollecito has cast serious doubt on foxy __knoxy__ 's alibi , with the italian now saying he ca n't be sure she was at his house for the whole of the night on which the british student was brutally murdered . all the evidence against the former couple points to knox , sollecito claims in papers filed by his lawyers in advance of the make-or-break supreme court hearing today . ms kercher , a 21-year-old student from coulsdon , surrey , -lrb- left -rrb- was found with her throat slit in her bedroom in perugia in 2007 . knox -lrb- right -rrb- is appealing a decision reinstating what was her conviction for killing kercher . rudy guede is serving a 16-year sentence for his involvement in kercher 's death after a separate trial . the house in perugia where british student meredith kercher was murdered aged just 21 in november 2007 . supporters of amanda knox are convinced that her guilty verdict for murder will be upheld by the italian supreme court when they make their decision later this week . american amanda knox and italian raffaele sollecito both stand accused of killing british student meredith kercher and have been tried three times for the crime . the last hearing , in january last year , again found them guilty . knox 's legal team has been warned that this decision is likely to be rubber-stamped by the supreme court today . people close to the case do not believe ms knox stands a chance in the __hugely-divisive__ case . one supporter said they were prepared for the ` greatest miscarriage of justice ' that has ever happened to a us citizen . in their previous two trials , knox maintained that they were together at sollecito 's flat on the night of the murder after which miss kercher , 21 , was found half-naked with her throat slit in the cottage she shared with knox in perugia , italy . in an __a-z__ of reasons for distancing his position from hers , sollecito 's lawyers are attempting to demonstrate that the evidence used against knox does not concern him . in the __306-page__ paper , sollecito claims that his computer records prove he was watching the japanese manga cartoon __naruto__ at the time of the alleged murder . but he is not sure whether knox was at his house for the whole night as he had been smoking marijuana . the document says : ` the defence intends to emphasise that sollecito has always shown himself to be __extraneous__ to the crime , and has always said that that night he did not move from his own home . however , he did not rule out that knox could have gone out .

' ` natalie has been through so much in her short life , ' said andy . natalie is pictured here on the left with her sister vanessa two years ago , before her lung condition worsened . ` her mother , tracy , died of lung cancer at just 39 , when natalie was pregnant with our eldest son , callum , so she never got to meet him . ` then in 2006 , bradley was born and at four months old he was rushed to hospital with a collapsed lung . bradley spent seven months in hospital and was later diagnosed with the same disease as natalie . ` we now have the worry that he too will end up like his mum , although he is a normal healthy boy at the moment . ` the wedding helped us to forget all the heartbreak for just a minute . ` there are many people to thank and we will get round to doing just that .

' ` in jesus ' name i pray , ' he said , then told the warden : ` i 'm ready . ' he took three deep breaths , then began snoring loudly . the __snores__ became progressively quiet , and all movement stopped within less than a minute . the sister of his victim was among witnesses watching through a window . he never looked at her . his own sister and a female friend cried as they watched in an adjacent room . vasquez 's lawyers filed no late appeals to delay his execution for the 1998 slaying of 51-year-old juanita ybarra . evidence at vasquez 's 1999 capital murder trial showed he and two other men were carrying out orders to kill 51-year-old juanita ybarra for ignoring the mexican mafia 's 10 per cent street tax on drugs -- known as a ` dime . ' ` i 'm sure she was told if you 're selling , you 've got to pay the tax , ' said mary green , an assistant bexar county district attorney who prosecuted vasquez . ' i guess she did n't take it seriously . ' after a night of drinking and drugs at a run-down san antonio motel , vasquez and two companions put on __bandannas__ on their __facesbarged__ into the nearby room of ybarra and her boyfriend , moses __bazan__ , early on march 19 , 1998 , according to evidence presented at his trial . __bazan__ was knocked out in an ensuing struggle but said he saw ybarra being beaten , heard vasquez __holler__ that she was biting him and saw vasquez using a telephone cord to strangle ybarra . the attackers grabbed valuables like cameras and jewelry , stuffed them into a __pillowcase__ and fled . when __bazan__ regained consciousness , he stumbled to the motel office to summon police . he was able to identify at least one of the attackers , leading to the arrest of all three . one of them , johnny joe cruz , took a plea deal that carried a seven-year sentence and testified against vasquez . the third man charged , __oligario__ __lujan__ , is serving a 35-year prison term . court records show the three were carrying out orders from mexican mafia boss rene munoz , who spent years on the texas department of public safety 's 10 most wanted list until his arrest in 2012 . joel perez , vasquez 's lead trial lawyer , recalled last week that the motive for the slaying was ` very detrimental ' . ` we have the texas mexican mafia , and anyone selling drugs they collect a dime - 10 percent , ' he said . ` and the motive in this case was she was n't paying . ' detectives also found the blood of the victims and vasquez 's blood on clothing left in the trunk of a car he used . ` it put him at the scene when he denied being around there , ' mary green , an assistant bexar county district attorney who prosecuted vasquez , said . the lethal injection of manuel vasquez on wednesday evening at huntsville prison in texas would leave t officials in the nation 's most active death penalty state with enough pentobarbital to carry out only one more execution until they are able to obtain a new supply . ' i recall he was an extremely violent individual . in the punishment phase we proved up two other homicides he 'd been involved with . ' vasquez had a lengthy record and had been in and out of prison at least twice . one conviction involved the beating of a man who died after his body was set on fire . records also show vasquez ' father is serving a life sentence for a 1976 murder , and a brother and cousins are or have been in prison . texas ' next execution is scheduled for next week . randall mays is set to die for a 2007 shootout where two east texas sheriff 's deputies were killed . executions set for april in the nation 's most active death penalty state will require a new lethal drug supply to be carried out . some states have started considering other options . utah 's legislature gave final approval tuesday night to a proposal to allow executions by firing squad if there is a drug shortage . legislation to allow firing squads also has been introduced in arkansas , while a wyoming __firing-squad__ measure failed . in oklahoma , lawmakers are considering legislation that would allow the state to use nitrogen gas to execute inmates . ' i remain optimistic we 'll be able to carry out executions according to the schedule , ' brad livingston , executive director of the texas department of criminal justice , has told the associated press . ` time will tell .

' clarkson allegedly believes that the bbc have launched a ` smear campaign ' against him which he ` wo n't let go ' . sources close to the 54-year-old have said he is likely to take action against the corporation for wrongful dismissal , if he is not reinstated to the programme . it comes amid reports that the bbc are filming a pilot of a new motoring show called the getaway car , which will see contestants travel abroad to take part in driving challenges . clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of ' a fracas ' , prompting the __top-rating__ show to be pulled off air . the four top gear __roadshows__ scheduled for norway next weekend have been postponed . tickets for the postponed shows cost between # 42 and # 100 , meaning the decision could cost the bbc more than # 1million in lost revenue if clarkson is sacked and the shows are not rescheduled . sacking clarkson could mean the end of top gear , which makes the bbc millions every year . speculation about his future has been mounting and will be decided this week when the corporation 's internal investigation into his behaviour is handed over to the director-general . the bbc 's internal inquiry into clarkson 's fracas with mr __oisin__ is expected to made public as soon as tuesday . it is being led by ken __macquarrie__ , the head of bbc scotland who oversaw the investigation into the disastrous newsnight edition that falsely accused the late conservative peer lord mcalpine of being involved in the north wales child abuse scandal . the presenter launched an extraordinary foul-mouthed rant at bbc bosses during a charity gala last week . speaking at an event in north london to raise money to help disadvantaged youths , clarkson said that he wanted to do one more lap of the show 's track ` before the ` f ****** b ******* sack me ' . he said : ' i did n't foresee my sacking , but i would like to do one last lap . so i 'll go down to surrey and i 'll do one last lap of that track before the f ****** b ******* sack me . ` i 'll be a bit tearful when i do it , but f *** it , let 's do it . and i 'll drive somebody around in whatever i can get hold of . i 'm sacked so it 's probably an austin maestro .

' insiders suggested clarkson and mr __tymon__ had given ` quite different ' versions of events . sources close to mr __tymon__ say he was punched and left with a split lip , while clarkson has admitted some ` handbags and pushing ' but is understood to have denied anything worse . the bbc was given a reminder of the strength of support behind clarkson when a __million-strong__ petition calling for his reinstatement was delivered to its headquarters - by tank . the vehicle , apparently driven by the motoring show 's enigmatic professional driver the stig , made its way from westminster , through central london and towards new broadcasting house near oxford street . fans were pictured rallying to support the delivery of the change.org petition , started by political website guido fawkes . there is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take top gear -- worth # 50million a year to bbc coffers -- off the air while the investigation was under way . the petition , launched last week , reads : ` we the __undersigned__ petition the bbc to reinstate jeremy clarkson . freedom to fracas . __#bringbackclarkson__ ' . ' it emerged yesterday that a report into clarkson 's behaviour was commissioned by bbc head of tv danny cohen after a series of other scandals last year . top gear caused an international incident after driving through argentina with a number plate allegedly linked to the falklands war and used the word ` slope ' describe an asian man . a report into the cases apparently concluded that top gear should have a new producer role to act as a go-between the show 's team and the bbc 's management to help deal with any future crisis . the bbc today refused to comment on the report or its conclusions . there is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take top gear -- worth # 50million a year to bbc coffers -- off the air while the investigation was under way . ` the programme could and should have carried on during clarkson 's suspension , ' said an insider . ` jeremy wants to stay with the programme and one possible way of him doing that would be if he could face up to his own shortcomings . ` he has a great deal of public support ... but he does need to rest and sort himself out .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  gareth lee -lrb- pictured leaving court today -rrb- said he was left ` shocked ' and in ` disbelief ' when the bakery refused his order . a christian baker who refused to make a cake bearing a __pro-gay__ marriage slogan has begun a court battle over equality laws . __belfast-based__ __ashers__ bakery refused to make a cake featuring an image of sesame street puppets bert and ernie below the motto ` support gay marriage ' . northern ireland 's equality commission is now supporting a legal action against the family-run bakery on behalf of gay rights activist gareth lee , whose order was declined . mr lee told a court today he was left ` shocked ' and in ` disbelief ' when one of the owners of the bakery , karen mcarthur , rang him and told him she would not be processing the order he had already paid for . ` it made me feel i 'm not worthy , a lesser person and to me that was wrong , ' he said . opening the case , robin allen qc , representing mr lee , said the baker 's objection on religious grounds was not lawful . he said baking a cake did not mean the bakers supported any message the cake might carry and compared the baking of a cake to a postman delivering a letter or a printer printing a poster . ' a postman taking a letter to the door or a printer carrying out a printing job - nobody would say that involved promoting or support , ' he said . ` it 's simply a functional relationship , a working relationship . ' the lawyer also noted the publicity around the case and highlighted that politicians , church figures , bloggers and others had expressed opinions on the matter . but the barrister insisted the case must be judged on the facts alone , saying : ` law must not be determined by those who shout loudest . ' mr allen qc said he was not in court to challenge the mcarthur family 's faith and highlighted that the proposed design would not have had an __ashers__ logo on it . the case is being heard at belfast county court by district judge isobel __brownlie__ . the commission , which monitors compliance with equality laws in the region , has alleged that the stance of the company was in breach of legislation . the case has sharply divided public opinion in northern ireland and beyond . in the wake of the bakery 's refusal to provide the service last may , the commission , a state-funded watchdog body , took on the case on behalf of mr lee . initially , the commission asked the bakery to acknowledge that it had breached legislation and offer ` modest ' damages to the customer . claims of discrimination were made after a __christian-run__ bakery in northern ireland refused to make a cake with a __pro-gay__ marriage slogan on it on religious grounds . pictured , left : the design . pictured , right : belfast councillor andrew muir cutting the cake which was eventually made by another bakery . __ashers__ bakery general manager daniel mcarthur , supported by his wife amy -lrb- right -rrb- , has said he is fighting the case to allow christian business owners to follow their beliefs in how they run their firms . when __ashers__ , which is owned by the mcarthur family , refused , the commission proceeded with the legal action . outlining his view of the facts , mr allen said mr lee had used the bakery in royal avenue in belfast city centre ` regularly ' before the incident . he said his client had seen a leaflet in the shop advertising a service whereby images could be printed in edible icing on a cake . he said there was nothing on the leaflet which suggested a limitation on the service due to ` religious __scruples__ ' . the barrister told the court that the order was accepted by __ashers__ director karen mcarthur and mr lee paid for it in full .

' he added that , as a precaution , all excursions to tunis have been cancelled . meanwhile a spokesman for travel agent association abta said the tourist season was only just getting under way but safety was always a priority . he told sky news : ` tourist numbers to tunisia have picked up over the last two years and we have had very healthy bookings for this summer . the season really picks up around mid-april to may . warning : it comes following a stark warning from the foreign office that ` further attacks are possible ' . pictured : tourists flee from the __bardo__ museum in tunis after wednesday 's attack . ` we now have a developing situation . abta follows fco advice very closely and safety is always the main concern . ' bob atkinson , a travel expert at __travelsupermarket__ , added : ` tour operators have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their tour operators . ` consumers who already have holidays booked this year will want to be convinced of the safety -- most of them will be staying at beach resorts and the vast bulk would not even go to tunis on a day trip . ' the tunis outrage has tragic echoes of the november 1997 luxor massacre in egypt , when gunmen killed 58 foreign holidaymakers including six britons . tour operators pulled out of the egyptian market and it was some time before holidays started again . the __clia__ spokesperson continued : ` cruise line security personnel , in addition to ongoing communication with national and international security authorities , enhance the security of cruise ships . ` __clia__ members maintain rigorous policies and procedures designed to safeguard passengers .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  joe biden made yet another of his trademark gaffes today as he met ireland 's prime minister to mark st patrick 's day - then suggested one side of its sectarian divide was unwelcome in washington . sporting a green tie and noticing that everyone else was also wearing one , or clad in green , he suddenly blurted : ` anyone wearing orange is not welcome in here . ' the purported joke was a reference to ireland 's religious and political divide which was at the heart of the troubles , the violence which killed 3,000 from the late 1960s until the start of the millennium . orange is the color associated with the protestant majority in northern ireland , and overcoming sectarian tensions has been a major part of the effort to bring peace to the __once-deeply__ troubled province . enda kenny , the irish prime minister -- whose official title is taoiseach -- and his wife __fionnuala__ kenny , the guests of honour , both laughed nervously . they said nothing , but continued to smile for the cameras . scroll down for video . wearing of the green : from left ireland 's prime minister enda kenny , his wife __fionnuala__ and vice-president joe biden . the vice president made a joke about sectarianism and got her name wrong . i 'm with ... : vice president joe biden points at shamrock worn in his breast pocket to mark st patrick 's day . after a brief pause , mr biden declared : ` only joking . ' he then welcomed the __kennys__ , irish ambassador anne anderson and the irish entourage into the naval observatory in washington , his official residence . the vice __pesident__ made no further reference to his __blurted-out__ bad joke , but at one point in his breakfast remarks appeared to refer to the taoiseach 's wife as ` fiona ' , although he subsequently corrected it to __fionnuala__ . northern irish protestants traditionally wear orange during their annual summer parades , while green is used as a symbol by mostly catholic irish nationalists and is a theme of st patrick 's day celebrations around the world . in northern ireland , there was an immediate demand from a senior unionist for an apology . ` whether they were intended as a joke or not , the comments are a slur on those who would be known as ` orange ' i.e. protestants , ' said the rev william mccrea , a member of the british parliament for the democratic unionist party . ` when northern ireland is making such an effort to make st patrick 's day an inclusive celebration , joe biden 's comments were disgraceful and careless , ' he added . asked about the request for an apology , an official in biden 's office said the vice president had made clear that he was joking . biden 's mother , catherine finnegan , was of irish origin . her ancestors had moved to ireland in the wake of the potato famine . the vice president made another minor blunder later when he read a quote from a __yeats__ poem he described as ` easter sunday 1916 ' , when the word sunday is not in the title . the poem was about the easter rising , when irish rebels began a violent attempt to force ireland to become independent from the united kingdom , which succeeded five years later . it actually broke out the next day , easter monday , april 24 of that year . the use of easter sunday would materially affect the subject of the poem , best known for its phrase ' a terrible beauty is born ' . he described __yeats__ as ' a protestant hero in a predominantly catholic country . ' he then told the taoiseach : ` you 've become a close friend and i admire you a great deal . ' laughing : despite the gaffe , irish prime minister enda kenny laughed with mr biden . mr biden also revealed that he had a __stammer__ as a child . ` my uncle , ed finnegan , a bachelor , used to sleep in the same room as my brother and i. i used to stutter very badly when i was a kid . but at night ed used to recite the poetry of __yeats__ . and i would get up and recite in front of a mirror , and try to learn not to __contort__ my face when i spoke and __stuttered__ . ' mr biden has a long list of previous gaffes -- he once asked a wheelchair-bound local politician to stand up and acknowledge the crowd 's applause , and after being chosen as vice president he even suggested that hillary clinton would have been a better choice . most recently he was widely ridiculed for putting his hands on the shoulders of stephanie carter , wife of defense secretary ash carter , and whispering in her ear as her husband was sworn in . he also told the father of a teenage girl -- utah republican senator orrin hatch 's __grandaughter__ emily -- that he hoped he had a ` big fence ' as hatch was sworn in . five years ago , biden incorrectly suggested at a st patrick 's day reception that the mother of then irish prime minister brian cowen was dead , saying ` god rest her soul ' , before correcting himself to say ` god bless her soul ' . at today 's washington event the taoiseach presented the vice president with a book of __yeats__ ' poetry , but told him he should not open it for at least another 25 years , ` when you are old and grey and nodding by the fire . ' he then invited mr biden to play a round of golf in ireland - the fifth time he has done so , with no success so far . mr kenny joked : ` the golf courses are still there . and they are in better condition than they have been for many years . so welcome home , finnegan . ' mr biden replied that last year the taoiseach had tried to __intercede__ for him with the president , telling him , ` you got ta let him go . you got ta let joe go . '

' they also note that ejections of material associated with the flare - known as a coronal mass ejection -lrb- cme -rrb- - are predicted to arrive today and tomorrow . ` the combined effects of these storms have prompted a g1 -lrb- minor -rrb- __geomagnetic__ storm watch to be issued , with the possibility of additional or upgraded watches __if/when__ additional data can be analysed , ' they wrote . a __geomagnetic__ storm is a temporary disturbance of earth 's atmosphere , which can cause communication problems . nasa 's solar dynamics observatory -lrb- __sdo__ -rrb- , illustration shown , was launched on 11 february 2010 and has observed the sun ever since . it 's goal is to understand how exactly the sun interacts with the environment around earth . it captured the images of this latest large flare . according to the us space weather prediction centre -lrb- __swpc__ -rrb- in boulder , colorado , the flare -lrb- shown -rrb- caused an hour-long blackout in some high-frequency radio __communicatiosn__ over some areas . a solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots . their frequency varies from several a day , when the sun is particularly active , to less than one a week during quiet periods . radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from radio waves at the long wavelength end , through optical emission to x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end . the amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of __100-megaton__ hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time . solar flares are not to be confused with coronal mass ejections -lrb- __cmes__ -rrb- . the former are the flash of light from the sun , while the latter are the actual emission of material that we often see as ` loops ' coming from the surface . while the two often accompany each other , the relationship between them is not entirely understood .

' the classes , which are priced between $ 333 and $ 999 for a month-long course , depending on what each adult is able to pay , have been taking place once a week throughout the month of march , and are scheduled during the evenings , so that any working adult participants are still able to attend , after completing a full day at the office . and , just like a traditional preschool , pupils get the chance to enjoy a class picture day , a slumber party and even a parents ' evening where they can show off their work . ` it 's amazing , we say `` it 's snack time '' and everyone is like `` yay , snack time '' - then its nap time and everybody cuddles up together in a ball , ' michelle added . ` they totally get into it -- it 's really great getting in there and making things with play-doh and loving it . ' interestingly , the adults who attend michelle 's classes confess that they feel no embarrassment about taking the opportunity to revert back to their childhood selves - and some even insist that the classes serve as a perfect way of inject more fun into their lives . put it all together : the classes are run by michelle -lrb- pictured -rrb- , who goes by the name of miss joni during school hours . daring duo : michelle -lrb- r -rrb- and her assistant miss __cancan__ -lrb- l -rrb- both have a background in early child development . __tuneful__ melody : the preschool program also includes music lessons for participants . lawyer amanda __devereux__ , 33 is one such participant , and admitted that she attends the classes because they provide her with a forum in which she can try new things and experience some of the fun she used to enjoy as a child . ` i 'm a __litigator__ , i deal with securities litigation and complex commercial cases , ' she explained . ` this is definitely a contrast from my job but i would like to think i 'm a lot like i was when i was a child . ' i still like to have fun and try new things . ` my family are really into the idea and my work colleagues are not surprised i 've taken the class . ` my mother just sent me a sweater for -lsb- my -rsb- class picture day with a note saying she used to pick out my clothes when i was four , so why not now ? ' along with lawyers from the corporate sector , the class also attracts mothers who want a break from their everyday obligations at home . sarah __fader__ , 35 , an author and mother-of-two , explained that attending the quirky preschool allows her to embrace her own inner child , after spending a day looking after the needs of her own children at home . ` being a mom and taking care of children is very taxing , ' she said . ' i wanted to get back to that feeling of freedom and childlike fun and wonder that i used to have . ` my children are seven and four and doing this grown up preschool reminds me of what it must be like as a child and helps me become a better parent . ' free and fun : michelle believes that the classes serve as a form of therapy for the adults . artistic expression : the adult attendees are even allowed to finger paint on the walls . secret success : michelle believes that each pupil at her preschool needs the chance to escape from their adult obligations . preschool mastermind creator michelle believes that , for many of her participants , the classes serve as a form of therapy , allowing adults to deal with their real world problems from the point of view of their inner child . ` my hope is that everyone who participates in preschool mastermind really comes out with a new sense of looking at the world with curiosity , with imagination and they are able to see things differently , ' she said . ` part of this is finding the secret to getting adults to get out of their normal routine and start playing more . ' with parents day currently on the horizon , michelle added that all of her pupils are being encouraged to bring along their own parents , or their friends and family members , to share with them everything that they have achieved during their classes . ` on parents day they will either have their parents or their friends here and they 'll get to show off in a big __show-and-tell__ showcase , ' michelle added . but while michelle 's classes have gone down a storm with her pupils , they have also , perhaps unsurprisingly , garnered some unwanted attention from prospective pupils who have misunderstood exactly what the classes are about . ` we have had some adults inquiring about changing diapers and if this is all about adult baby play - but that is not what this is , ' michelle explained . ` there is nothing sexual about this class it 's just fun . ` there are some people that think this is a waste of time and a waste of money - they say they can finger paint on their own . ` to them i would say go and finger paint on your own -- i hope you do . freedom of expression : according to michelle , the participants at her preschool are looking to find ` more magic in life ' select group : michelle admitted that the classes have received some criticism , but added that she is aware her preschool program ` is not for everybody ' ` it 's fine that people criticise this -- it 's not for everybody . ` people come because they want to stop being so serious all the time and want to learn and have that fun come to them and they want to find more magic in life . ' while the classes might seem like a bit of a folly for pupils , both michelle , and her assistant miss __cancan__ , boast an impressive background in early child development - and both have experience in preschool education . ` something you may not know about me is that i have nearly half a degree in early childhood education , ' michelle explains on her website . ' i wanted to be a preschool teacher for many years , so that is what i originally went to college for ! i love __preschoolers__ , and we connect on a serious level . ` but then i realized that career path meant being chained to a classroom and told that my butt ca n't show ... so i switched to fashion merchandising . ' she adds : ' -lsb- miss __cancan__ -rsb- used to be a preschool teacher abroad and has fantastic insights , puns , a master 's in teaching , and imagination . ' but despite her enthusiasm for the class and her pupils , michelle remains realistic about how some people will view her grown up preschool . she added : ` for those of you who say this is a weird thing to do , i would say you are probably right . '

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  since september 1996 , arsene wenger has ruled the roost at arsenal , not just building a squad and controlling a team , but shaping a club . in almost 19 years in charge of the gunners , wenger has won three premier league titles , lifted five fa cups , led his team to their only ever european final and masterminded the move to the emirates . when he does eventually decide to step down , wenger 's legacy will not just be about his successes , but also his longevity . arsene wenger has been at arsenal for almost 19 years , while every other team has changed manager . wenger led the gunners to their first champions league final , and has won three premier league titles . the arsenal boss has been in north london since september 1996 , surviving 156 premier league bosses . in an era where premier league chairmen are as forgiving to their managers as jose mourinho tends to be towards referees , wenger is approaching two decades in the job -- almost 15 years longer than the next longest-serving manager in the division . in fact , since the frenchman arrived in north london , there have been 156 changes in management at the other clubs in the division . here __sporstmail__ looks at the men wenger has survived ... what counts as a change ? with caretaker managers , interim appointments , and even the odd case of two men doing the job at the same time , it can be difficult to tell when exactly a club have officially changed managers . counting caretaker managers would mean , technically , that david __pleat__ had been appointed tottenham manager three times in five years . there were times when it seemed david __pleat__ just had to wait a few minutes to be caretaker at spurs again . ruud gullit had already left two premier league clubs before wenger had been in the job three years . gordon strachan -lrb- left -rrb- replacing ron atkinson was the second change after wenger arrived . so while ` interim ' managers are included in our total , caretakers are not included unless they were given the job for a fixed term . added to that , for those few occasions when two men have been in charge at the same time , they are counted as only one sacking unless , as with the case of roy evans when he worked alongside gerard __houlier__ at liverpool , one is sacked before the other . landmarks . that all means that gus poyet 's sacking this month is the __156th__ managerial change since wenger took over . ray __harford__ 's resignation at blackburn , less than a month after ` the professor ' got his feet under the desk at arsenal , was the first , with five more coming in the __1996-97__ season . ray __harford__ -lrb- left -rrb- was the first manager to go after wenger was appointed , while gus poyet is the most recent . peter reid 's dismissal from leeds united in november 2003 marked the 50th reign wenger had survived , while steve bruce 's decision to leave wigan for sunderland brought up the century in the summer of 2009 . tony pulis ' shock resignation from crystal palace on the eve of this season was the 150th time a manager had left their job in the wenger era . peter reid , sacked by leeds in 2003 , marked the 50th premier league manager to go in the wenger era . when steve bruce left wigan for sunderland it marked the 100th managerial change since wenger arrived . unsurprisingly the rate of change has dramatically increased in recent years . the first half of wenger 's tenure at arsenal produced just 63 __sackings__ in a little over nine years . in the same time since then , there have been 93 changes , at a rate of around 10 a season . last season 's total of 14 managerial changes was , in fact , the largest number in premier league history . in contrast the __2002-03__ season saw the fewest changes since wenger 's arrival , with only five managers leaving their posts . tony pulis ' resignation from crystal palace last summer was change no 150 since wenger started . method of change ? the vast majority of the time , when a premier league manager leaves his job , it 's because he 's been told to clear out his desk . a lucky few get to set their own date , as wenger surely will in the coming years , but most are pushed before they can jump . remarkably , in the last __18-and-a-bit__ years since wenger joined arsenal , only 18 managers left by choice to go straight into another job -lrb- and three of those went to international management rather than another club -rrb- , while some resigned and a handful retired . roy hodgson is one of only two premier league managers in the past two decades to leave for england . steve mcclaren also left a premier league club to take the biggest job in english football . three times a manager stepped down for health reasons , although two of those were joe kinnear , while one manager , dave jones , was placed on gardening leave in january 2000 . ron atkinson -lrb- coventry -rrb- and steve __coppell__ -lrb- crystal palace -rrb- share the honour of being the two managers in since 1996 to have been removed from their job only to move upwards to director of football , something that may well happen to wenger when he decides to end his term in management . which clubs change the most ? we all have a good idea who we consider to be the most __trigger-happy__ owners , or the least stable clubs , and it should therefore come as no surprise which two clubs top the list of managerial changes . chelsea and newcastle united have each replaced 11 men since arsene wenger walked into highbury . at stamford bridge there were only two __sackings__ -- ruud gullit and gianluca __vialli__ -- between the arrivals of wenger and roman abramovich , but the revolving door has turned nine times since the russian arrived . glenn hoddle -lrb- left -rrb- and alan shearer have both managed one of the league 's most prolific clubs . jose mourinho 's return for his second spell at chelsea was the club 's 12th appointment since wenger started . since roman abramovich took over at chelsea the club have had nine managers , jose twice , in 12 years . manchester united - 2 . everton - 4 . liverpool - 6 . aston villa - 7 . tottenham - 10 . chelsea - 11 . change has at least brought success for chelsea , but the same can not be said at st james ' park , where john carver is the 12th man to try and pick up a trophy since arsenal last appointed a manager . the gunners ' north london rivals tottenham are just behind chelsea and newcastle , having replaced 10 managers since their neighbours went for wenger . gerry francis , jacques __santini__ , christian gross , george graham , glenn hoddle , martin jol , __juande__ ramos , harry redknapp , andre villas-boas and tim sherwood have all left since wenger arrived . jacques __santini__ -lrb- left -rrb- and martin jol are two of the 10 tottenham managers who have been replaced . tim sherwood -lrb- right -rrb- became the 10th spurs manager to do battle with wenger last season . perhaps most impressive in their high number of changes though , are southampton and sunderland , who have managed nine premier league managerial replacements each , despite spending a fair amount of time outside the top flight since 1996 . saints have had seven wenger years below the premier league -- including two in __legue__ one -- while sunderland have had five . of the top flight 's __ever-presents__ , manchester united have unsurprisingly had the fewest changes , with just sir alex ferguson 's retirement and david moyes ' sacking , while liverpool have said goodbye to six bosses during wenger 's tenure . sir alex ferguson -lrb- right -rrb- and wenger locked horns repeatedly until the former 's retirement in 2013 . who has managed the most clubs ? it is not just clubs that can get restless . while wenger has been happy to stick in one job since deep blue something 's breakfast at tiffany 's was top of the charts , other managers prefer to move around . england manager roy hodgson has left four premier league clubs -- blackburn , fulham , liverpool and west brom -- in the last 18 years . harry redknapp has left five premier league jobs in the time wenger has been in his only one . redknapp won the fa cup in one of his two spells at portsmouth , which ended in october 2008 . stoke city boss mark hughes is on his fifth premier league job since wenger arrived in north london . stoke city 's mark hughes has matched that , his terms at blackburn , fulham , manchester city and qpr all coming to an end while wenger stayed put . but neither of them can match harry redknapp , who has left five jobs , at four clubs , since the arsenal boss took charge of his side . redknapp most recently resigned as qpr manager , but has also been in charge at tottenham , west ham and had two spells at portsmouth in the top flight .
