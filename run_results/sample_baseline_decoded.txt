INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  nick gordon 's stepfather has revealed in a new interview that he fears for the life of bobbi kristina 's troubled fiance . it has been reported that gordon , 25 , has threatened suicide and has been taking xanax since whitney houston 's daughter was found unconscious in a bathtub in late january . on wednesday , access hollywood spoke exclusively to gordon 's stepfather about his son 's state of mind , asking him if he fears for nick 's life . scroll down for video . speaking out : nick gordon 's father -lrb- left and right -rrb- gave an interview about the 25-year-old fiance of bobbi kristina brown , who reportedly had threatened suicide . access hollywood will air the complete interview thursday . ' i fear ... that if something happens to bobbi kristina , like , if she does n't pull it through , then i will fear for my son 's life , ' the stepfather stated . access hollywood will air the complete interview thursday . speaking to dr phil mcgraw gordon , 25 , said : ` i lost the most legendary singer ever and i 'm scared to lose __krissy__ . i want to let all you guys know i did everything possible in the world to protect them . ' gordon 's impassioned assertion was made during a dramatic intervention staged by dr phil last week and due to air today . weeping and wailing and at times incoherent , gordon had believed that he was to be interviewed by dr phil . gordon had told the eminent psychologist that he wanted to tell his side of the story . he has felt ` vilified ' and ` depicted as a monster ' since january 31 when bobby kristina , 22 , was found face down and unresponsive in the __bath-tub__ at the roswell , georgia home he and bobby kristina shared . breakdown : with his mother , michelle , by his side nick gordon struggles to stay coherent . troubling preview : a trailer for the interview of bobbi kristina brown 's boyfriend nick gordon by dr phil mcgraw was released sunday night . swinging from crying to flying into a rage , the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by dr phil . but on learning of gordon 's emotional , mental and physical state dr phil could not ` in good conscience ' go on with the interview . according to gordon 's mother , michelle , who was by her son 's side during the highly emotional intervention , ` nicholas is at a breaking point . he can not bear not being without __krissy__ , by her side . he 's dealing with it by drinking . i 've begged him to stop . ' dr phil told gordon , who admitted to having taken xanax and to have drunk heavily prior to the meeting : ` nick , you 're out of control . you 've threatened suicide . you deserved to get some help because if you do n't , you know you 're going to wind up dead . ' he added : ` you 've got to get yourself cleaned up . you got to man up and straighten up . ' yesterday dailymail.com revealed that , barely 12 hours before the dramatic encounter with dr phil , gordon was so drunk and high he was unable to walk . the disturbing scenes captured on video showed the true extent of a deterioration described by dr phil as ` exponential . ' in the show , due to broadcast wednesday , a weeping and wailing gordon admitted that he has twice tried to kill himself and confessed : ` i 'm so sorry for everything . ' asked if he still intended to kill himself he said : ` if anything happens to __krissi__ i will . ' he said : ` my pain is horrible . my heart hurts . i have panic attacks . ' in recent weeks gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of xanax , alcohol and prescription sleeping pills . gordon had agreed to meet with dr phil believing that he was there to be interviewed . according to dr phil : ` he felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster . ' instead , on learning of gordon 's rapidly deteriorating mental , emotional and physical state , the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab . dr phil stated : ' i do n't think he has any chance of turning this round . left to his own devices he will be dead within the week . ' gordon 's mother , michelle , was by her son 's side as he __alternated__ between compliant and aggressive -- at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed . she described her son as ` at breaking point . ' she said : ` he can not take too much more of not being able to see __kriss__ . he blames himself . he 's torn up and carrying guilt . ` he 's dealing with it by drinking . i 've begged him to stop . i 've tried to help him but he ca n't let go of the guilt . ' leaning towards gordon 's mother , dr phil said : ` you and i have one mission with one possible outcome and that 's for him to agree to go to rehab to deal with his depression , his guilt ... and to get clean and sober . ' he added : ` his life absolutely hangs in the balance . ' questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of january 31st that led to bobbi kristina , 22 , ending up face down in her tub . just two days ago bobbi kristina 's aunt , __leolah__ brown , made a series of explosive facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had ` strong __evidene__ of foul play ' relating to gordon 's role in events . she posted : ` nick gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate ! especially to my family . moreover , he has done things to my niece that i never thought he had in him to do ! ' __leolah__ made her claims in response to being invited onto dr phil 's show . tough to watch : the young man sobs and shakes at times through the trailer . in her message she wrote : ` with all due respect , nick gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece ... . we have strong evidence of foul play . ' marks were found on her face and arms , marks that gordon has explained as the result of cpr which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived . and speaking to dr phil , gordon insisted : ' i did everything possible in the world to protect them -lsb- whitney and bobbi kristina -rsb- . ' railing against the decision by bobbi 's father , bobby brown , to ban him from his fiancée 's bedside at atlanta 's emory hospital , gordon said : ` my name will be the first she calls . ' according to his mother , michelle , gordon can not forgive himself for his ` failure ' to revive bobbi kristina . his guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier . ' i hate bobby brown ! ' his tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend 's father bobby brown , who has blocked him from seeing the 22-year-old in the hospital . ` are you drinking ? ' the emotional man 's anger only increases as dr. phil asks about nick 's sobriety . refuses to go : the 25-year-old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help . resigned : ultimately , gordon concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility . then , on 11 february 2012 , it was gordon who tried to resuscitate whitney when she was found unresponsive in her __bath-tub__ just hours before she was due to attend a grammy awards party . speaking to dr phil , michelle said : ` nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed whitney . ` he administered cpr -lsb- to whitney -rsb- and he called me when he was standing over her body . he could n't understand why he could n't revive her . he said , `` mommy why ? i could n't get the air into her lungs . '' gordon has now entered a rehab facility in atlanta . meanwhile his fiancée continues to fight for her life in a medically-induced coma . it is now six weeks since bobbi kristina -- __krissi__ as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the __bath-tub__ of the home she shared with gordon in roswell , georgia . unlike whitney 's death that was ruled accidental , police are treating bobbi kristina 's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22-year-old as a criminal investigation . while bobbi kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with nick , of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident , has emerged . in an interview with the sun a friend of the couple , steven __stepho__ , claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin , xanax , pot and heroin substitute __roxicodone__ . sounding eerily similar to bobbi 's mother and father 's __drug-dependent__ relationship , the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on . ` bobbi and nick would spend a lot on drugs every day , it just depended on how much money they had . it was n't unusual for them to spend $ 1,000 a day on drugs . ` there were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours , just lying there on the bed . there were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice . she was always covered in cigarette burns . ' their relationship was also very volatile . ` when whitney died nick was left with nothing , so he knew he had to control __krissi__ to get access to the money . she 'd do whatever he told her . ` he was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her . they would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around . ' according to __stepho__ : ` but __krissi__ really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother . she was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her . nick knew this and took advantage of it . ' troubled relationship : a friend of the couple , steven __stepho__ , claimed the pair were using various drugs daily including heroin , xanax , pot and heroin substitute __roxicodone__ .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  the world is finally in the grip of a long-awaited el niño event that could alter global weather patterns - but the phenomenon is far weaker than expected . scientists have announced that sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central pacific ocean and have started to alter wind patterns . the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance el niño will continue through the summer . the us national oceanic and __atmosopheric__ administration has detected warmer than average water surface temperatures around the equator of the pacific ocean -lrb- shown above -rrb- which indicates the arrival of el niño . however , they say that the el niño conditions are currently ` extremely weak ' and come at a time of the year when the influence of el niño on weather patterns usually declines . this means that while el niño conditions normally brings wetter weather to the northern hemisphere in the summer , it is unlikely to be bring substantially more rainfall than this spring . el niño is caused by a shift in the distribution of warm water in the pacific ocean around the equator . usually the wind blows strongly from east to west , due to the rotation of the earth , causing water to pile up in the western part of the pacific . this pulls up colder water from the deep ocean in the eastern pacific . however , in an el niño , the winds pushing the water get weaker and cause the warmer water to shift back towards the east . this causes the eastern pacific to get warmer . but as the ocean temperature is linked to the wind currents , this causes the winds to grow weaker still and so the ocean grows warmer , meaning the el niño grows . this change in air and ocean currents around the equator can have a major impact on the weather patterns around the globe by creating pressure anomalies in the atmosphere . the noaa said that it was unlikely the phenomenon would bring enough rain this spring to break the three-year record-breaking drought that is currently affecting california . some meteorologists , however , have warned that this el niño could combine with another slow movement of water temperature in the pacific ocean called the pacific __decadal__ __osciallation__ -lrb- __pdo__ -rrb- . the __pdo__ reached record levels in december last year and january this year , and should it stay strong , it may combine with el niño to increase global temperatures . mike __halpert__ , deputy director of noaa 's climate prediction centre , said : ` based on the persistent observations of above-average sea surface temperatures across the western and central equatorial pacific ocean and consistent pattern of sea level pressure , we can now say that el niño is here . ` many climate prediction models show this weak el niño continuing into summer . ' the arrival of this el niño is considered to be late after scientists last year predicted they were expecting one last year , but the conditions failed to materialise . according to the met office el niño conditions generally bring warmer temperatures to europe during the autumn and colder winter temperatures . the above diagram shows the sea surface temperature -lrb- __sst__ -rrb- in the pacific ocean on 25 __feburary__ 2015 and it can be seen that around the equator the temperature was above average -lrb- marked by red -rrb- on that date . it can also make __sourthern__ europe wetter during the late summer and autumn . perhaps the greatest impact is felt in the monsoon regions of south east asia where the climate is usually drier than normal in el niño years . el niño is one of the most powerful climate altering __phenonoma__ on the planet . it is the result of the el niño southern __oscillation__ , which is the cycle of warm and cold water across the pacific ocean . this cycle occurs at intervals of between two to seven years and can last for nine months to two years . when the ocean is warmer than average for seven to nine months , the noaa officially classes it as el niño conditions . california is in the midst of the worst drought in 1,200 years and has caused severe drying of the stevens creek reservoir -lrb- shown above -rrb- . it is unlikely the el niño will bring enough spring rain to ease the drought . the last el niño , in 2009-2010 , was a moderate to strong event . this brought freezing weather to northern europe in the winter of __2009/2010__ and the uk was exceptionally cold . the vancouver winter olympics also suffered a far warmer than average winter during the same event . other recent el niño 's in __2002-2003__ , __2004-2005__ and __2006-2007__ have been weak to moderate in strength . the last very strong el nino was __1997-1998__ and was known for providing heavy rainfall in the west of the united states , especially california . the noaa said that last week the sea temperature across much of the equatorial pacific ocean has been above average . they also found that unusually weak easterly winds have persisted across the eastern pacific ocean . in late january and february there were a couple of westerly wind bursts of over the central tropical pacific and forecasts for march suggest these will continue . the noaa said that this mean the equatorial southern __oscillation__ index , which is uses to monitor the el niño , has been a negative value for the second month in a row . the above diagram shows the impacts of a typical el niño on seasonal temperatures around the world . the above diagram shows how a typical el niño is expected to change seasonal rainfall around the world . in a blog post on the onset of el niño , the noaa said : ` at this time , these are extremely weak el niño conditions , during a time of year when the influence of el niño on weather patterns in north america or other locations outside of the tropics is weakening . ` from an impacts perspective , this is not particularly momentous , as el niño impacts are weak in the spring and summer . ` still , after months of hovering under the threshold , we can now say that el niño conditions have arrived . ' noaa scientists are to continue monitoring the situation and will issue an update in april . however , eric __holthaus__ , a meteorologist writing for new scientist , warned that the arrival of el niño could result in this year being especially warm . he said : ` el niño transfers huge amounts of heat from the oceans to the atmosphere , and there are hints that this el niño , combined with the already very warm global oceans , could bring about a new phase in global warming . ` an associated slow-moving indicator of pacific ocean temperatures , called the pacific __decadal__ __oscillation__ -lrb- __pdo__ -rrb- , reached record levels in december and january . ' a persistently strong __pdo__ is associated with cold winters in the eastern us and drought in california -- we 've had both in abundance this year . ` should the __pdo__ stay strong , it will essentially join forces with el niño and increase the odds that 2015 will rank as the warmest year on record globally . '

' -lsb- the school -rsb- is dismissing the value that witnessing this rare astronomical event will have on many pupils and it goes against the idea that school is a place of education . ' parents in other areas say they have been left running around after schools only announced today that children would have to bring their own ` __eclipse-viewing__ glasses ' . the decision has caused anger among parents , who do not want their children to miss out on the event . pupils around britain also went online to complain after some were told the blinds in their classrooms would be closed during the eclipse and others said they would be shown a recording of the event in the afternoon . __oldway__ primary school in paignton , devon , is another one of those which has come under fire for keeping children inside , where they will watch it on computer screens . parent sophie __bertorelli__ said : ` it is a bit of a shame to watch it on a computer . i would have thought they would have maybe supplied some protective glasses . ' head teacher jane smythe said she had 700 children to look after and she ` could not guarantee that they would not look at the sun ' . ms smythe said she understood if parents wanted to keep children at home for the first hour of school so they could watch it together . the school is not the only one to make the decision . the __penryn__ primary academy cornwall says it is broadcasting the event for children in the school hall , __lasswade__ primary school in __bonnyrigg__ , midlothian are also keeping students indoors and bishop __vesey__ 's grammar school in birmingham is screening it on tv in the afternoon to all but year 7 students , who will be allowed outside . __oldway__ primary school in paignton , devon , is keeping pupils inside . its headteacher , jane smythe -lrb- left -rrb- says she can not guarantee pupils will not look at the sun . some parent 's have back the decision . fiona __bullman__ , in paignton , told the bbc : ` it 's too much of a risk . you ca n't risk 700 children potentially being blinded . unless there 's one adult to one child , you ca n't -lsb- risk it -rsb- . ' the department for education has said what schools do for the eclipse is a matter for individual head teachers to decide . would you let your child watch the solar eclipse ? would you let your child watch the solar eclipse ? now share your opinion . looking at the sun either with naked eyes or through __unfiltered__ binoculars or telescopes can permanently damage people 's eyesight . those who want to look at the occurrence are being advised to use __pin-hole__ projectors or glasses with special filters . it is feared clouds could also ruin viewing of the eclipse , with overcast skies forecast for much of the south west of england . northern cities such as lancaster , york and newcastle should have sunnier days and scotland , where the eclipse will conceal almost 98 per cent of the sun in places , will be largely clear . a met office spokeswoman said : ` forecasting exactly where cloud will break and reform is really not scientifically possible . but it 's not as thick in the south as further north , so you 're more likely to see breaks in the cloud the further south you are . ' it is not unknown for a fleeting break in cloud to occur during an eclipse as the atmosphere cools . another ` deep ' partial eclipse visible in the uk will not occur until august 12 , 2026 , and the next total eclipse not until september __2090__ . tomorrow 's eclipse will produce a __100-mile-wide__ ` totality ' shadow path that crosses the north atlantic and covers only two land masses , the faroe islands between scotland and iceland and the norwegian archipelago of svalbard . astronomer gemma lavender from all about space magazine . do you need special equipment to look at the eclipse ? ` it 's all too easy to look at the sun when an eclipse is happening , but you should never look at the eclipse with naked eyes , binoculars or a telescope without filters - otherwise you run the risk of permanently damaging your eyesight . ` that 's not to say that you ca n't watch the eclipse on friday - but you should ensure that you have the right equipment that will provide you with the right amount of protection . ` dedicated telescopes such as solar telescopes can allow you to observe the eclipse with absolutely no risk . however , unless you already own one , know somebody who does or are looking to get into solar astronomy , they can be a massive investment of several hundred pounds . ` there are cheaper ways to observe the eclipse , though . ' are solar glasses fine to use ? ` many people buy solar glasses or viewers to watch the eclipse . these can be bought quite cheaply from telescope dealers . ` they work by employing a __mylar__ film that blocks out over 99 per cent of the sun 's light , allowing you to view the eclipse safely . ` before using them though , you should make sure that they are not damaged in any way and you should ensure that you have bought them from a reputable dealer . if you 're in doubt , do n't use your viewers at all . ' how can you use a telescope to observe the eclipse ? ` if you own a telescope , then there are several ways for you to observe the eclipse . ` if you do n't own them already , it is possible for you to buy a solar filter , which covers the aperture of your telescope to ensure that you can observe the sun safely . the movement of the sun and moon means the eclipse will be seen at different times around the uk . ` they are found to be made of glass or as with the solar glasses , __mylar__ film . it is possible to make a solar filter using __mylar__ sheets but caution is advised while making your own solar filter - any scratches or __pinholes__ will lead to dangerous amount of sunlight entering your eyes . ` you should also avoid relying on __eyepiece__ filters - they can not handle the sun 's light . ` telescope projection is also a safe way to observe the eclipse . by using two large , white pieces of card , you can project the eclipse 's image onto one piece , while using the other to fit around your telescope 's tube to act as a mask to shield your eyes from the sun . ` focusing your telescope 's __eyepiece__ , while holding the second card away , which projects the image , will enable you to show the eclipse to a large group of people safely . ` you should not use a cheap , plastic telescope for telescope projection and ensure that your __finderscope__ has its cap on . ` never look at the eclipse whilst lining up your telescope with the sun and never leave your telescope unattended . you should also ensure that your instrument does n't overheat . ' can you use household items to view the eclipse ? ` if you do n't have a standard telescope or have forgotten to buy a solar viewer , then there are several household items you can use so that you do n't miss out on seeing this fantastic event . ` using a piece of card , or anything that has small holes punched into it , you can project the eclipse onto another piece of card . this is certainly one of the safest ways of viewing the eclipse since you do n't need to look at the sun at all . ' a washing up bowl or bucket can also be lined with a black bin liner and then filled with water to make a reflective surface to safely watch the eclipse . when and where will the eclipse be visible ? ` the eclipse will begin in the morning . for observers in the uk , the eclipse starts at 8.30 am , peaks at __9.35__ am and ends at __10.41__ am , so you should make sure that you know where the sun rises from your location . ` the total solar eclipse - that 's 100 per cent of the sun 's surface covered by the moon - is visible from the faroe islands and svalbard but if you are unable to get to these locations , many are able to see a substantial partial eclipse - for instance , scotland will see around 90 per cent of the sun 's disc covered by the moon . ' how dark will it get in the uk ? ` in london and even in places where there 's 90 per cent sun coverage , we 're not really going to notice any changes in brightness because there 's still a portion of the sun 's surface uncovered . ` it 'll be like there 's a cloud passing over the sun - you know it 's cloudy but it 's still light . ' this map of the uk shows where the eclipse will be visible and what time it will reach its peak .
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: moon will pass in front of sun tomorrow creating 98 % eclipse in some parts . the event due to take place at 9.30 am , meaning children will be at school . parents angry after some headteachers decide to keep youngsters indoors . school chiefs say they will not risk children 's eyesight from looking at sun .
