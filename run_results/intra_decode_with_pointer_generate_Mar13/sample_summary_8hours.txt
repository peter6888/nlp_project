INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  when a legendary figure like pat jennings says none of the other __1,097__ matches in his career was comparable with the 1979 fa cup final between arsenal and manchester united , you know it was something special . forever known as wembley 's ` five-minute final ' , arsenal threw away and then regained the trophy in an incredible late sequence that saw them squander a 2-0 lead going into the 86th minute before winning 3-2 in the final moments with a goal that put alan sunderland 's name in fa cup folklore . it created a superstar in arsenal 's man-of-the-match liam brady and broke the career of manchester united manager dave sexton . pat jennings -lrb- left -rrb- and pat rice pose with the fa cup after the dramatic wembley final of 1979 . jennings reacts after conceding a goal as manchester united fought back to level the scores at 2-2 . but alan sunderland scored the winning goal for arsenal to write his name into cup folklore . victorious captain pat rice was so drained and overcome with emotion as he climbed the famous 39 steps to finally lift the trophy , he delivered an unwitting snub to the famous royal guest of honour . rice recalls : ` prince charles was there to present the trophy . he said , ` congratulations ' as we shook hands but as soon as i saw the cup , i turned around to lift it up to the arsenal fans . ' i did n't realise he was still waiting to give me my medal . it was only when i turned back , i saw him with it in his hand . it must have looked insulting but it was n't meant like that . eager is the polite way of putting it . just a couple of minutes before i 'd been out on the pitch thinking ` f *** , we 've blown it ' . ' sammy mcilroy , who had scored united 's dramatic equaliser on a baking hot may afternoon , says the impact of the game has not diminished with time . ` it 's 36 years on and people still ask me about it every week , ' he adds __ruefully__ . ` they always want to know about that final rather than the one we won against liverpool two years earlier . ' united and arsenal meet again in the fa cup on monday in a quarter-final at old trafford but it is impossible that wayne rooney and alexis sanchez will grip the nation like their predecessors did . ` there has not been a final before or since with the twists and turns of that game , ' says brady , who helped set up the winning goal when arsenal were on their knees reeling from mcilroy 's equaliser . ' i played two short of 1,100 games and i have never known four minutes like that , ' adds jennings , a gentle giant of a goalkeeper who otherwise stayed unflappable in a 23-year career with watford , spurs , arsenal and northern ireland . sammy mcilroy -lrb- left -rrb- scored united 's equaliser against arsenal in the dramatic 79 cup final . alexis sanchez -lrb- left -rrb- of arsenal and wayne rooney -lrb- right -rrb- of manchester united will lock horns on monday . the 1979 showpiece took place eight days after margaret thatcher had been elected great britain 's first female prime minister and given the prestige of the fa cup final in those days , the two events seemed equally important at the time . a full house of 100,000 and a tv audience of 15 million was guaranteed . united travelled to their team hotel a full three days before the match to fulfil the insatiable demands of the press , photographers and television cameras , with bbc and itv planning their entire saturday schedules around the final . then , as now , arsenal and united were big clubs in transition . arsenal had not won a trophy for eight years , while united were rebuilding after the glory days of george best , denis law and bobby charlton . they had been relegated to the second division five years earlier . both sets of supporters flocked down wembley way convinced good times were about to return for their club . for 85 minutes , the match appeared routine , with brian talbot scoring for arsenal after 12 minutes and frank stapleton adding to it with a __43rd-minute__ header . the only talking point was over who should be credited with the opening goal -- talbot or sunderland , who appeared to connect at the same time . ' i know it was mine . i 've got a picture on my trophy cabinet showing me kicking the ball and alan kicking my boot , ' says talbot . with arsenal leading 2-0 going into the final minutes , complacency crept in . ` it was unprofessional but i met eyes with liam as if to say , ` yes , we 've won it ' , ' says graham __rix__ . ` we were coasting , comfortable , ' adds talbot . even the experienced jennings says : ' i was imagining myself going up the steps . ' brian talbot -lrb- right -rrb- opened the scoring for arsenal after only 12 minutes in the cup final against united . gordon mcqueen -lrb- fifth left -rrb- pulled a goal back in the 86th minute to give united hope . then , with just five minutes left , arsenal boss terry neill decided to send on substitute steve walford for david price as a thank-you for his performances in earlier rounds . it backfired disastrously . out of nowhere , in the 86th minute , gordon mcqueen drove in a loose ball from a set piece to make it 2-1 . just 106 second later , mcilroy __jinked__ past david o'leary and walford before __toepoking__ past an onrushing jennings to equalise . pandemonium ensued in the stadium as arsenal fell apart . ' i knew the cameras were on me so i put on my best acting , trying to look concerned but not terribly worried , ' says neill . ` in reality , my insides were going up and down . ' reflecting now , mcilroy says : ` the arsenal boys were gone , on their knees . if we 'd taken it into extra-time , we would have won . ' i went crazy , i could have run out of wembley and back in again after that goal . after the game , bob bishop -lsb- the scout from northern ireland who discovered both mcilroy and best -rsb- told me we 'd celebrated too long , we should have gone back to the halfway line and concentrated . ` he was probably right but it was not what we wanted to hear after throwing it away . ' at 2-2 , united were now red-hot favourites but what happened from the restart is part of fa cup legend . brady surged into the united half past mickey thomas , then past lou __macari__ , and slipped a ball to __rix__ on the left . frank stapleton in possession for arsenal in the cup final against united at wembley in 1979 . liam brady -lrb- left -rrb- , frank stapleton -lrb- centre -rrb- and david o'leary -lrb- right -rrb- were in arsenal 's winning squad . __rix__ , a 21-year-old from a south yorkshire pit village , delivered a cross that __arced__ away from united goalkeeper gary bailey , leaving sunderland the chance to score from close-range . the picture of the __bouffant-haired__ forward running away in total ecstasy chased by the __most-relieved__ substitute in history , walford , remains an iconic image . ` when i picked up the ball , i was initially just trying to get the ball away from our goal , ' says brady . ' i went past one challenge , two challenges and i was in the final third and i saw graham outside me . ' __rix__ takes up the story . ' i did n't know sunderland was at the far post , my only thought was to take the cross away from the goalkeeper . it was something i 'd trained on with -lsb- coach -rsb- don howe all those wet and windy wednesday nights : keep it out of the keeper 's grasp . ' sunderland says : ' i went into __auto-pilot__ and when the ball went it , the pent-up emotion came out . ' just two minutes , 59 seconds had elapsed between the three goals and history had been made . more than 250,000 arsenal fans greeted the team 's heroes in islington the following day . the arsenal players collected bonuses nearly three times their # __1,000-a-week__ wages but for some the long-term rewards turned out to be far greater . brady 's performances against juventus in the following season 's european __cup-winners__ ' cup persuaded the italian giants to sign him and he blazed a trail for many other first division stars like ray wilkins and paul gascoigne to go to serie a. for united , being a runner-up was not good enough and sexton was sacked within two years . ` he was unlucky , if we 'd won the final , he would have been given more time , ' says thomas , a comment that will be of interest to louis van gaal . more than 250,000 supporters came out to greet arsenal the day after their fa cup triumph . arsenal parade the trophy around wembley after securing a dramatic victory over united . arsenal 's class of __'79__ still meet up for reunions at the emirates and rice will be at old trafford tomorrow with the club 's board of directors . ' i still remember the elation , ' says the former arsenal captain . ` when __sundy__ scored , i thought , ` right , we 're not going to bloody lose this again ' . ' if monday 's tie produces just a quarter of the late drama of ' 79 , it will be a thriller .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  jonny evans has __grudgingly__ accepted the __six-match__ ban imposed on him by the fa for spitting at papiss cisse . there is no right of appeal for the manchester united defender and he begins his ban immediately by missing monday 's fa cup quarter-final with arsenal . though he maintains that he did not spit at the newcastle united striker , the fa found evans guilty and confirmed in a statement : ` mr evans denied the charge but it was found proven . ' jonny evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the newcastle united striker , who then __retaliates__ . evans and papiss cisse clash near the half-way line at st james ' park following the unpleasant exchange . manchester united defender evans has received a __six-match__ ban from the fa after the ugly incident . cisse already served a three-match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing everton 's seamus coleman in december . as a result , the newcastle striker gets an additional one-match suspension after admitting his guilt , while evans gets six . the incident , during united 's 1-0 win at st james ' park on wednesday , was not seen by referee anthony taylor or his assistants , but was caught on tv . a three-man panel of former referees reviewed the footage on thursday and agreed the players should have been sent off , prompting the fa to bring a charge . an independent regulatory commission heard the charge and decided both players should be banned . cisse , 29 , pleaded guilty and issued an apology for his part in the incident . he is suspended for an extra game as he was banned in december for elbowing everton 's seamus coleman . by contrast , evans , 27 , had denied the charge on thursday , saying : ` i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at papiss cisse . ' cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the fa on thursday . tempers threaten to boil over as team-mates from newcastle and united gather on the pitch . arsenal -lrb- h -rrb- , monday -lrb- fa cup quarter-final -rrb- . tottenham -lrb- h -rrb- , march 15 -lrb- premier league -rrb- . liverpool -lrb- a -rrb- , march 22 -lrb- premier league -rrb- . aston villa -lrb- h -rrb- , april 4 -lrb- premier league -rrb- . man city -lrb- h -rrb- april 12 -lrb- premier league -rrb- . chelsea -lrb- a -rrb- april 18 -lrb- premier league -rrb- . the fa also looked at an incident where evans was alleged to have spat in the direction of emmanuel riviere during the game but that was dismissed . evans will potentially miss any fa cup semi-final should united progress plus their premier league games against tottenham , liverpool , aston villa and manchester city . if united were to lose on monday , evans would then miss the trip to chelsea and would not return until united 's premier league trip to everton on april 26 . united defender evans has received a __six-match__ ban from the fa - one less than newcastle striker cisse . there is no right of appeal so evans will not be able to contest the decision by the three-man panel . 1 . the association may act against a participant in respect of any ` misconduct ' , which is . defined as being a breach of the following : . -lrb- a -rrb- the laws of the game ; . -lrb- b -rrb- the rules and regulations of the association and in particular rules e3 to 28 below ; . -lrb- c -rrb- the statutes and regulations of uefa ; . -lrb- d -rrb- the statutes and regulations of fifa ; . -lrb- e -rrb- the rules or regulations of an affiliated association or competition ; . -lrb- f -rrb- an order , requirement , direction or instruction of the association . that would be a blow for united manager louis van gaal , who insisted ahead of the cup clash with arsenal at old trafford that the main priority for united this season must be to qualify for the champions league . united have n't won the fa cup since 2004 and have n't landed any silverware since sir alex ferguson left , but the dutchman says the competition must still be treated as a welcome bonus rather than the club 's primary objective . ` i always want to get the goals we have set . and the goal we have set is the top four , ' said van gaal . ` a title is fantastic . when you win the fa cup you are not in the champions league , which is important for the club , but you have won a title . so for the players it is fantastic , for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the champions league . ' cisse was banned for an extra game after being sent off for elbowing seamus coleman in december .
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: jonny evans and papiss cisse involved in spitting row on wednesday . evans denied charge but has been found guilty and hit with !!__six-game__!! ban . cisse admitted fa charge and it triggered an immediate seven-match ban . cisse 's suspension is one game longer because he had already served a three-match ban earlier this season for an elbow on seamus coleman . there is no right of appeal so evans will not be able to contest the ban . evans will miss united 's fa cup quarter-final with arsenal on monday .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  those who would love to see the lesser spotted laura robson back competing on a tennis court are learning that it is a question of hope __trumping__ expectation . having withdrawn from the qualifying event of this week 's miami open , she has now removed herself from the entry list to next month 's wta tour event in bogota , and the new target for her return appears to be the french open in may . that suggests she is going to be left with at least 16 months of catching up to do when her troublesome wrist is deemed fit for full tournament play again , having not played since the australian open in january last year . former british no 1 laura robson protects her wrist while out in london . nobody is more frustrated about this than robson herself , now 21 and without a world ranking . she would dearly love to be in miami now , but instead is back practising over in bradenton near tampa at the img academy . perhaps __encouragingly__ , she posted a picture of herself on twitter doing a full , __tendon-testing__ handstand . robson admitted last summer that she has shed tears over this hiatus in her career , which has proved longer than feared since she played her last match in melbourne before eventually undergoing wrist surgery . here this week her manager , max __eisenbud__ , issued a __positive-sounding__ update while preaching patience : `` i 'm happy with the way it 's been going and she 's been hitting the ball great in practice , '' he said . `` it 's a question of waiting until the coaches think she can play five matches in a week . it 's all about when she is ready to compete . we do n't want to put her in a situation where she ca n't play a full tournament . '' among __eisenbud__ 's other clients include maria sharapova , whose intermittent struggles with her shoulder have informed his approach . `` i learned a lot from the whole experience with maria , and that 's why i feel strongly about not rushing it . laura is still young with a lot of time ahead . '' sharapova seems to have won her battle , but there are other examples of players who show just what a tough road lies ahead for robson - and that on the assumption that she shows a full-on appetite for hard work that has not always been evident . when she finally decided to go for surgery last april to repair a minor tendon tear she sought the advice of 2009 us open champion juan martin del potro , who has had operations on both wrists . she used the same specialist at the mayo clinic in minnesota . ironically this has turned out to be the argentine 's own comeback event and on thursday evening he lost 6-4 7-6 to __vasek__ __pospisil__ . the fact that this was just his second tournament in fourteen months after an __abortive__ return in january shows just how __infernally__ complex wrist injuries are for tennis players . he was just delighted to be back on court : `` it 's not 100 % free , but i felt even better than sydney tournament in january , '' he said . `` it 's only two months after my second surgery and my left wrist . i feel better week by week , but it 's still very early to feel 100 % . `` mentally you must be strongest enough to deal with the problem and get up every morning to do your treatments and rehab and stay calm , looking forward for the future . i 'm not hurried to be in the top 10 very soon . i want to play tennis . it does n't matter how long it 's take me to be in the top again . '' being absent for a long period of time with any injury brings with it problems in a tennis world that constantly evolves . an example of this is 2010 wimbledon finalist vera zvonareva , who was out for 17 months following the 2012 olympics due to a shoulder problem that required surgery . robson has sought the advice of 2009 us open champion juan martin del potro . del potro made only his second tournament appearance in 14 months at the miami open . since returning at the start of last year the talented russian has not got past the third round at any event and her ranking still __languishes__ at 153 . she lost another first round here this week . so it could be hard for robson whenever she returns , although on her side is that she does have bags of natural ability and is a superb ball striker . that much was clear when , enjoying a rare spell free from injury , she became the first british player since jo __durie__ to reach the world 's top 30 in the summer of 2013 aged only 19 . it might yet make more sense for her to wait until the season begins on more forgiving grass rather than arduous clay to make her return . when she does she will have a new clothes sponsor in nike after being dropped by adidas , and will be coached by colombian mauricio __hadad__ , a former guide of heather watson . the 22 year-old from guernsey plays world no 15 angelique kerber in the second round while andy murray will take on america 's donald young .

' current british no 1 watson -lrb- left -rrb- shakes hands with kerber at the net after their second round match . laura robson has been backed to reach the top 10 upon her return from a 15-month injury lay-off . there are signs that robson may finally be ready for a return to action in time for may 's french open in paris , despite missing out on miami and taking her name off the entry list for next month 's wta tour event in bogota . when she does come back , however , it is likely to be at a __lower-profile__ event . meanwhile , her long-time friendly rival watson resumed at 5-7 down in her __rain-delayed__ contest with kerber , having missed a set point the previous afternoon before a deluge arrived . the final two sets proved to be as wildly undulating as the first one had been . the 22-year-old from guernsey , breathing down the neck of her career-high ranking of 38 , will know that this was a match she could have won against a player who has been as high as no 5 in the world but has suffered a disappointing year to date . watson plays a shot at the 2013 us open - she has been out injured after needing surgery on her wrist . former us tennis star chris evert has backed robson to return to her best and make it to the top 10 . with a little more composure she would have done , and an indication of how much it hinged on the more vital moments was that she ended up with more points than her more experienced opponent , with 113 to 111 . the games often came in blocks as two nervous combatants became confident and then fearful again , depending on the scoreboard . in relatively cool conditions for this event , watson went 2-0 up in the second , then 3-2 down , before reeling off the next four games . watson ` will be fine ' as she is very young , according to former world no 1 evert . kerber , a left-hander who has been to the wimbledon semi-finals , then surged to 5-1 as watson was broken immediately in the decider , losing one point through a __volleying__ error of astonishing simplicity . the anxious german looked tired -- ` she 's __knackered__ , heather ' cried out an english voice -- and watson duly got back on serve to 4-5 before four unforced errors sealed her fate . it could have been a different end to this segment of the season , and once her doubles is over she will be concentrating on the clay courts .
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: heather watson was beaten in the miami open second round on saturday . angelique kerber won 7-5 , 3-6 , 6-4 against watson to end her progress . elsewhere , chris evert has backed laura robson to reach the top 10 . robson has been out for 14 months with a wrist injury that needed surgery .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  fans of chelsea , blackburn and wigan may be shocked to learn that unheralded striker franco di santo is currently one of the hottest properties in germany 's bundesliga with werder bremen where he has scored 12 goals in his last 18 matches . even more surprising is the argentine 's views on the respective merits of the two leagues . contrary to popular belief , the 25-year-old insists players in germany are made to train harder than their premier league counterparts and that games are more intense and competitive in the bundesliga . a few months ago , di santo 's opinions might have been ridiculed but given the dismal performances of english clubs in europe this season , it appears he may have a point . franco di santo is loving life in the bundesliga with werder bremen after stints with three english clubs . the argentine striker moved to england with chelsea but also played for blackburn and wigan . following chelsea 's exit against paris saint-germain , it is unlikely any premier league will be in the quarter-finals of the champions league , with manchester city and arsenal both losing their first leg matches at home . in contrast , bayern munich are safely through to the last eight with borussia dortmund and bayer leverkusen having a great chance of joining them from the bundesliga next week . their fourth representative schalke gave real madrid an almighty scare at the bernabeu before going out 5-4 on aggregate . ` when i came to germany , i thought it would be a little bit less intense than the premier league , ' admitted di santo , who signed for bremen on a __bosman__ free following wigan 's relegation in 2013 . ` but when i got here and felt the intensity , it was like `` wow '' . everything is fast just like in england but sometimes i feel there is more pressure here . in the english league , you have time to turn around and go against the defender face-to-face , but here it is always pressure , pressure , pressure . di santo says he thought it would be a little bit less intense than the premier league but he was surprised . di santo says that after a career as a young player in the premier league he finds the bundesliga as intense . ` the other thing that is different is the kind of training . here , we train __twice-a-day__ two or three times a week . it was hard for me coming from english football where you sometimes have two days free in a week . ` here it is impossible to do that . maybe you have one day off every two weeks . the philosophy is completely different . in england , they think your body needs to rest to be fit for the game , to get it in great condition . here it is the opposite , you have to train more . ` sometimes it feels too much but you do feel stronger in key moments because you are training , training . when i was in england i would be a little bit more tired in the last 10 minutes . here i feel good , so maybe for my body it is better to train ! ' the reputation of the premier league has taken a __nose-dive__ recently but di santo is not surprised our top clubs are n't able to dominate in the champions league and suggests there may be a snob value towards the bundesliga because of the dominance of bayern munich . the 6ft 4in centre forward has 12 goals in his last 18 games as bremen rise up the bundesliga table . ' i think germany and england have the strongest two leagues but the big difference is the marketing . the premier league has 10 years more experience in that , ' he says . ` on the pitch , the premier league is not better or quicker . ` of course , bayern munich is by far the best team in germany but it 's not because the other teams are s *** , it is just because they very strong . ` if bayern came into the premier league , they would finish __top-three__ for sure and they could win it , why not ? they have world cup winners and players like -lrb- arjen -rrb- robben , -lrb- robert -rrb- lewandowski and -lrb- franck -rrb- ribery . di santo , modestly for his league , believes bayern munich would be in the premier league 's top three . the big striker took on chelsea and their midfield giant nemanja matic in pre-season . bremen won 3-1 . ` just because some of the other teams in germany are n't big names , it does n't mean they 're not good . ` we played chelsea in pre-season and beat them 3-1 . ok , it was pre-season but chelsea put out a good team and it was n't like they were able to score 10 against us . ' di santo , a 6ft 4in centre forward , has packed a lot of experience into his short career . he left argentina for chile very young and at 17 signed for chelsea with a big reputation . it did n't quite happen for him at stamford bridge and he failed to score a goal for them in two seasons . ' i had to be realistic , i was competing against -lrb- didier -rrb- drogba , -lrb- nicolas -rrb- anelka , -lrb- andriy -rrb- shevchenko , -lrb- claudio -rrb- pizarro and -lrb- salomon -rrb- kalou for a place and they were probably better than me at the time , ' he admits . ` the most time i got was 45 minutes against aston villa when anelka got injured . ' the presence of didier drogba -lrb- left -rrb- , who is still di santo 's friend , made it difficult for him to get game time . di santo -lrb- right -rrb- says his loan to blackburn went well at first but then he was dropped by sam allardyce . franco di santo has hailed his argentine international team-mate angel di maria as one of the top 10 players in the world . di maria has struggled in england , as di santo did , following a record # 59.7 million summer move to manchester united . but di santo insists : ` di maria did so well in the world cup for argentina , it was a shame he was injured for the final against germany otherwise the outcome might have been different , for sure . ` he is among the top 10 players in the world . his best position is on the wing , either right or left . he is quick and skilful but some players need more time to settle into a new league than others . ` i 'd say -lrb- lionel -rrb- messi and -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo are on a different planet but after them , there are five or six of around the level -- sergio aguero , arjen robben , edinson cavani , zlatan ibrahimovic -- and di maria . ' he went on loan to blackburn . ' i played every single game for a half a season and did really well , but did n't score - that was my big problem . i decided to stay another six months but then the manager sam allardyce did n't play me any more . it was weird , from amazing to becoming very hard . but i did get a goal and assist in our local derby against burnley and they made a dvd of the match with my face on the cover ! ' ironically , it was roberto martinez -- now in charge of england 's sole europa league survivors everton -- who helped start to turn his career around by signing him for wigan on a permanent basis in 2010 . ` it was my personal decision to leave chelsea , i still had time on my contract but needed to play . roberto told me i was good enough to play for argentina , he gave me confidence . and he made me think about getting into the penalty area more . before then , i only wanted to score pretty goals , go past a lot of players . ` now i realise if it comes off my knee , it still counts as one goal and that has helped me . ' wigan won the fa cup -- di santo was an unused substitute - and were relegated in the same season , and martinez left for everton . he signed arouna kone , __antolin__ alcaraz , james mccarthy and joel robles -- but not di santo . ` there is no problem with that , it would have been difficult to sign so many players from wigan , ' says the player . blackburn fans mob di santo after he scored against burnley and it even earned him a space on a dvd cover . wigan lifted the fa cup at wembley before being relegated , although di santo did n't play a single minute . instead , the forward -- who won three caps for argentina during his time at the dw stadium -- went to bremen in northern germany and is finally fulfilling the promise everyone predicted in his teens . his winning goal against freiburg last weekend lifted bremen up to eighth , just six points of a champions league berth . unfortunately a booking also means he is suspended for saturday 's big match against bayern . he still keeps in touch with old chelsea pals like drogba and branislav ivanovic and friends from wigan like alcaraz and __maynor__ figueroa . he admits though that having not been ready for english football at 17 , he would fancy a return at some point to see how the intensity and hard work in the german league have helped him develop . wigan owner dave whelan gets a champagne shower from di santo , but they would soon part company . while di santo is enjoying the bundesliga , he says he fancies a shot at ` revenge ' in the premier league . ' i am happy here really , i know i am in a league that is very competitive , one of the best in the world , ' he said . ` in one way i am very happy here , i am doing well and playing in a very competitive league . but for the other side i would like to have my revenge in the english league , show what i can do with the experience i now have . it may depend on roberto martinez or other coaches what happens ! ` if i have to stay in germany , i am going to be happy , and for the other side , if i have to go to england , i will try to do my best to show i am better than last time . ' di santo still has friends in england from his time there and keeps contact with a few chelsea players . di santo faced top players in england but says germany 's lack of big names does n't make teams 's *** '
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: franco di santo was not at his best with chelsea , blackburn or wigan . but now he has 12 goals in 18 games with werder bremen . di santo says the bundesliga clubs demand players to train harder . he says bayern munich would at least finish in premier league 's top three . didier drogba and branislav ivanovic are still in touch with the argentine . striker wants to come back to have ` revenge on the english league ' di santo backs angel di maria to come good for manchester united .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  from abseiling onto __traffic-jammed__ roads to fitness training on city pavements , isis ' newest video shows its ` elite ' special forces squadron in action . the comical eight-minute video shows them practicing forced entries on unlocked doors , __rappelling__ down the sides of buildings and bizarrely using large logs to help each other up walls . and the lack of a formal base does not deter the hapless extremists who make do with the side of a busy road in an unknown middle east location . ` special ' : one recruit struggles to free himself from the rope he traversed down in a new video showing isis ' elite fighting unit . tactical training : with no formal base to hone their deadly skills , the extremists make do with main roads in an unknown middle eastern location . teamwork : extremist soldiers undergo strange training __scnearios__ in the eight-minute propaganda video which shows the soldiers helping each other up walls with a log . tight squeeze : after his overweight colleague throws a __flash-bang__ grenade into this abandoned house , a jihadi soldier takes the unusual entry route through the window . __taskmaster__ : the soldiers ' commander - dressed completely in black - forces them to crawl on pavements as he literally walks all over his recruits . death-defying : the militants practice high-octane manoeuvres like __rappelling__ down tall buildings in unison to show off their military prowess . __showboating__ : one soldier shows off by displaying the black jihadi flag as he hangs upside down , hundreds of feet above the ground below . here the recruits are moulded into the terror group 's deadliest soldiers by a commander who makes them army crawl on pavements and - literally - walks all over them . one sheepishly looks to the camera as his colleague kicks open an unlocked gate and another seems to lose his balance as he kneels to take his position inside . and there is little secrecy about this special forces unit who train in front of hundreds of bemused onlookers . a triumphant soldier even __showboats__ to the crowd below by holding up the notorious black flag used by islamist groups as he hangs upside down - hundreds of feet above the ground below . but one of his partners in terror struggles to free himself from the rope he traversed down , while some overweight soldiers look a little sluggish running through traffic . the formation of such a force is not a cause for concern according to former sas soldier andy mcnab who described the footage as a ` very funny ' pr film . the man who uses the name as a pseudonym to protect his identity told mailonline : ` just looking at the guys as they handle weapons ... it is clear that not even regular soldiers have much to worry about from these guys . ' and although islamic state 's aspiration to train a deadly special forces battalion is worrying , it is mostly a ` display of force for a local and international audience ' according to director of international security studies at security think-tank __rusi__ . daring : one jihadi soldier in army fatigues __rappels__ upside down as hundreds of onlookers watch from below . hardened : the ` special forces ' unit 's intensive training culminates in the recruits traversing a narrow and shallow river with their weapons . show of force : such public displays of dominance ` makes people both fear them , but also makes them an attractive force for people to want to go and join ' , one defence expert told mailonline . elite : __raffaello__ __pantucci__ from __rusi__ said the propaganda video is a chance for isis to glorify not only its tactics and soldiers - but the weapons it has seized . leader : one isis commander - the only one not masked in the entire video - addresses the audience flanked by four menacing isis soldiers . deadly : the isis soldiers - who trained in a busy middle eastern city - also carry out heavy weapons training in a slightly more remote location . __raffaello__ __pantucci__ told mailonline : ` they are showing off their capabilities and captured equipment given the us issue m16 rifles on display . ` by showing off their men 's ability , training and captured equipment , they are demonstrating that they are a strong force that is still in control of its territory and are an effective force . ` this makes people both fear them , but also makes them an attractive force for people to want to go and join . ' previous footage from islamic state 's training camps believed to be in iraq showed recruits disguised as bushes . other drills involved the extremists performing unnecessary forward rolls over mounds which would leave them far more exposed to enemy fire than keeping low with a commando crawl . while in some scenes , the recruits have a crack at martial arts by taking it turns to smash wall tiles over their own heads . the terror group , which has been determined to portray itself as a formal military force , showed off its ` sniper battalion ' in a much more threatening display in late february . through its vast social media channels , it released pictures of bearded and clean-shaven men posing with long-range sniper rifles in northern iraq . __sharpshooters__ : in later february , the militant group has revealed pictures of its special ` sniper battalion ' -lrb- pictured -rrb- . violent legacy : islamic state twitter accounts are linking the sniper battalion to a famous iraqi sniper . believes to be a __propagandist__ reply to the hit us film american sniper , the fighters were kitted out in khaki uniforms , peaked caps and ski goggles to protect them from the glare of the sun . the unit is part of the __ninewa__ division of northern iraq according to us-based jihadi tracking organisation site . isis snipers have seen action in both syria and iraq where they have been responsible for the deaths of many kurdish and iraqi soldiers . they played a prominent role in the battle for kobane which involved intense street fighting even though the extremists were eventually expelled from the city . isis twitter accounts were quick to link the battalion to a famous iraqi sniper who plagued american forces during the iraqi conflict . one said the unit was carrying on the legacy of ` juba the sniper ' - a sunni insurgent who operated in baghdad from 2005 where he is said to have killed around 40 american soldiers .
