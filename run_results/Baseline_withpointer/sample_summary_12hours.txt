' i thought to myself , i hope this old guy with a gun does n't do anything stupid .

' i submit that blake did n't have to testify and michael jackson did n't have to testify because the prosecution foolishly wanted to introduce portions of their interviews , ' said attorney thomas __mesereau__ jr. , who represented both men . ` they just got greedy . they were mesmerized by portions they thought could help them .

' i would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials , ' said george fisher , a former prosecutor and professor at stanford law school . ` the flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face . ' in the case of blake , prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with barbara walters because it contradicted other evidence . the defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview . ` it did a great deal both to __humanize__ him and so he was n't just seen as a celebrity , ' said m. gerald __schwartzbach__ , who won blake 's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife . ` there was an image projected that a lot of people had about robert as a difficult person . in this video , he came across as a very sympathetic person .

' i ca n't say it was the diet for sure , but things like the energy drinks could be contributing factors . red meats - all things we have found out have so many impurities in them now . ' i think it was a combination of it all . ' mr __wharmby__ had been a bodybuilder for 20 years before he became ill . in the beginning , he admits to taking steroids for about a year to create his physique because ` everybody did it ' . but he soon turned his back on them , as he began to build his personal training business . it was then his diet took a turn for the worse . ' i could train seven clients in a day , back-to-back , ' he said . ` then i would have to have the energy to train myself . ' he added : ' i was constantly on the go . ' dean __wharmby__ was on a high-calorie diet for four to five years , as he tried to get make his body as big as possible . here , he reveals what he ate during an average day . breakfast : an entire pack of bacon , made into eight sandwiches and a protein shake 2,500 calories . snack : a steak muffin -lrb- sandwich -rrb- 225 calories . snack : two sweet potatoes and a full chicken __1,190__ calories . snack : a protein shake 262 calories . snack : two protein bars 580 calories . snack : large mcdonalds quarter pounder meal with a diet coke __855__ calories . snack : supermarket bought pizza - normally pepperoni __888__ calories . dinner : chips or rice with three chicken breasts or a steak __783__ calories . snack : __400g__ of beef on its own 1,000 calories . supper : 15 boiled eggs __1,170__ calories . snack : protein shake 262 calories . total : __9,715__ calories a day . but that is not all : . overnight , dean used to wake up every two hours to eat either a full pack of jaffa cakes , a jar of peanut butter , or more protein bars - pushing him over the 10,000 __calorie-a-day__ mark . mr __wharmby__ said his hectic lifestyle meant he turned to fast food to get the calories he needed . some days , he would see seven clients back-to-back - and would fit eating every two hours around them . mr __wharmby__ found the energy from seven to eight cans of energy drink while eating every two hours . and while some of it was typical bodybuilder fare - protein shakes , eggs and chicken - other bits were less conventional . mr __wharmby__ would grab a mcdonalds for a snack , and a pizza on the way home - which he would eat while his girlfriend of five years cooked dinner . at his biggest , he was 20 stone . but then the personal trainer from rochdale , greater manchester , became unwell five-and-a-half years ago , and doctors discovered a growth . mr __wharmby__ and partner charlotte rigby -lrb- pictured -rrb- started to research natural medicine after his diagnosis . he was offered chemotherapy and a liver transplant , but he decided to turn both down in favour of natural remedies . ' i refused it from day one , ' he said . ` the main reason why i chose to do natural instead of artificial was because i wanted to live . i did n't want to die . ' but that meant he needed to completely rethink his diet , which was full of things like acids - which he believes help cancers thrive . and for a year , it was successful : mr __wharmby__ 's tumour disappeared . ` but i got complacent , ' he admitted . ` the old lifestyle crept in again . ' in 2013 , he collapsed outside the gym where he was working as a trainer , and rushed to hospital . for the majority of the next year , he returned to his healthy regime . but then things started to go wrong : he broke up with his girlfriend briefly , and found himself homeless - making it hard to concentrate on getting better . by november , he was in hospital ` hooked up to every machine you could think of ' . doctors said he had just three weeks to live . the tumour had got too big to operate , and there was little the doctors felt they could do . ' i was offered chemotherapy , but doctors basically said there was no point , ' mr __wharmby__ said . mr __wharmby__ , at his heaviest , weighed 20 stone - something he admits was also not good for his body . mr __wharmby__ and miss rigby , who have been together for five years , hope to inspire others with his new diet . it is not known exactly what causes liver cancer , but research has suggested diet could be a factor . non-alcoholic fatty liver disease - which is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes - has been linked to cases of liver cancer . the disease occurs when small deposits of fat build up in the tissue . but while it is a common condition , in some cases , with people who have high levels of fat the liver can become inflamed . this can scar the liver over time - causing cirrhosis , which is linked to many cases of liver cancer . energy drinks , meanwhile , have been linked to cases of bowel cancer by scientists in scotland , according to the scotsman . it was also reported earlier this year that some energy drinks have as many as 20 teaspoons of sugar in them . sources : nhs choices . so he and girlfriend charlotte rigby - his ` rock ' - began his healthy regime once more . they also began fundraising to help pay for the treatment costs and have attracted more than 2,000 likes on facebook by regularly posting videos of his progress . he has also visited a doctor in london - and is hoping to shrink his tumour by using natural medicine . mr __wharmby__ is also hoping to inspire others through social media to live more healthily . ms rigby , 27 , said : ` there are lots of examples out there of people beating cancer naturally , even when they 've been told there 's nothing conventional medicine can do for them . ` the support dean has received has really lifted him . people have been so positive and it has really made a difference to his attitude . ` now he 's determined to inspire others to live more healthily .

' referring to the 2003 kidnapping and transportation to egypt of italian cleric abu omar by the cia and the subsequent conviction in absentia by an italian court of __ex-cia__ operative robert __seldon__ lady for that crime , he added : ` there 's good reasons to dislike the americans , we 've done a lot of bad things around the world , i can agree with a lot of their criticisms . ms kercher , a 21-year-old student from coulsdon , surrey , was found with her throat slit in her bedroom in perugia in 2007 . the house in perugia where british student meredith kercher was murdered aged just 21 in november 2007 . raffaele sollecito is pictured leaving rome 's supreme court on wednesday as italy 's top judges delayed a ruling on whether to uphold his and amanda knox 's conviction for the murder of student meredith kercher . rudy guede is serving a 16-year sentence for his involvement in kercher 's death after a separate trial . ` our cia kidnapped an islamic cleric , an italian citizen , and they ca n't get their minister of justice to ask the us for an extradition , they ca n't get it done , so they 're frustrated . ` -lsb- but in this case -rsb- raffaele is collateral damage . if we confirm their convictions , we send an innocent italian man -- and the people probably wo n't like that -- to prison , and the -lsb- italian -rsb- minister of justice probably wo n't even ask for extradition , but even if he did are they going to pick a fight with the united states of america on a false claim ? ` the kidnapping of an italian citizen -- that 's a legitimate claim and they still do n't want to take on the usa . so are they going to take on the us on a __b.s.__ claim ? ` no . it 's a fraud , and everybody knows it and everybody is playing along .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  facebook has already begun flying its giant drones designed to bring internet access to the world , mark zuckerberg has revealed . ` as part of our effort to connect the world , we 've designed unmanned aircraft that can beam internet access down to people from the sky , ' he posted on his facebook page . ` today , i 'm excited to share that we 've successfully completed our first test flight of these aircraft in the uk . ' zuckerberg revealed the final design will have a wingspan greater than a boeing 737 but will weigh less than a car . it will be powered by solar panels on its wings and it will be able to stay at altitudes of more than 60,000 feet for months at a time . facebook aims to use a mix of solar-powered aircraft and __low-orbit__ satellites to beam signals carrying the internet to __hard-to-reach__ locations . the drones , flying at 65,000 ft -lrb- __19,800__ metres -rrb- , will be capable of staying in the air for months . they are relatively cheap and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals . the drones are effectively mobile phone masts in the sky and bounce smartphone communications between satellites and base stations on earth . __low-orbit__ and __geosynchronous__ satellites , which have orbits that match the earth 's rotation and are effectively stationary , will cover more remote areas in africa and asia . the internet access would be transmitted in the form of __free-space__ optical communication , or __fso__ , which transmits data using infrared laser beams . ` the final design will have a wingspan greater than a boeing 737 but will weigh less than a car . ` it will be powered by solar panels on its wings and it will be able to stay at altitudes of more than 60,000 feet for months at a time .

' at a summit in new york earlier this year , facebook 's engineering director announced the vehicles will be closer in size to jumbo jets , than traditional drones , and they 'll soar at 65,000 ft -lrb- __19,800__ metres -rrb- . following the tests , it could then be just three to five years until the super-sized , solar-powered drones are hovering above remote parts of the world to provide internet access . __yael__ maguire , engineering director of facebook 's connectivity lab , told the social good summit that the planes will be ` roughly the size ' of a boeing 747 , but much lighter than the popular aeroplane , which weighs around 600,000 lbs -lrb- __272,155__ kg -rrb- without passengers or fuel . facebook previously said the drones will be ` relatively cheap ' - although did not specify a cost - and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals . the california-based tech giant has joined forces with nokia , qualcomm , samsung and other tech firms to develop the planes in an initiative called __internet.org__ . facebook has revealed more details about its plans to provide web access to the world . drones as large as jets are set to extend the reach of wi-fi around the world . they will be powered by the sun and hover some 65,000 feet -lrb- __19,800__ metres -rrb- above the ground . today , around 2.7 billion people have access to the internet , which is just one third of the global population . the members of the initiative said in a report that connecting the world is ` one of the fundamental challenges of our time ' and they plan to do it using a variety of technologies , including drones . ` the final design will have a wingspan greater than a boeing 737 -lrb- pictured -rrb- but will weigh less than a car , ' said zuckerberg . ` when people have access to the internet , they can not only connect with their friends , family and communities , but they can also gain access to the tools and information to help find jobs , start businesses , access healthcare , education and financial services and have a greater say in their societies . ` they get to participate in the knowledge economy , ' the report said . a recent study by deloitte found that the internet is already an important driver of economic growth in many developing countries . expanding internet access could create another 140 million new jobs , lift 160 million people out of poverty and reduce child mortality by hundreds of thousands of lives . in terms of how this could be achieved , mr __maquire__ has previously explained that facebook is ` looking at a new type of plane architecture . ' the drones are set to fly at 65,000 ft -lrb- __19,800__ metres -rrb- , because this altitude is a point where winds are at their lowest . it 's also above commercial airliners , and even above the weather , and this means the drones will be able to safely stay in the air for months at a time . ` these planes are solar-powered and they sit there and circle around , and have the ability to broadcast internet down . ' facebook 's founder and ceo mark zuckerberg announced in march that the social network 's connectivity lab was building ` drones , satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to everyone ' the large drones will be capable of broadcasting a powerful signal that covers a __city-sized__ area of territory with a medium population density , according to __internet.org__ . the large drones will be capable of broadcasting a powerful __sthe__ drones will be tougher and able to fly for longer periods of time than balloons , while also being able to have their location precisely controlled . in march this year , facebook acquired british drone maker __ascenta__ for an estimated # 12.5 million -lrb- $ __20.2__ million -rrb- . the company is run by chief engineer andrew cox who has helped set records for the longest flights for unmanned aircraft powered by the sun .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  mothers are now as likely to go out to work as women without children , figures showed yesterday . the historic landmark reached last year means just one mother in four stays at home to raise children . figures from the office for national statistics showed __74.1__ per cent of mothers with children under 16 , or between 16 and 18 if they are still at school , are regarded as ` participating in the labour market ' . by comparison , 75 per cent of women without dependent children were either in work or looking for a job last year . mothers are now as likely to go out to work as women without children , figures showed yesterday . in the mid-1990s , only two thirds of mothers had jobs , while then , as now , three in four childless women were working . the gap has closed because there are now half a million more women with children under five in work , or looking for jobs , than in 1996 . there are also 200,000 more women with children aged between five and ten in the labour market . mothers were briefly more likely to have jobs than women without families in 2013 , the ons report revealed , but last year more than 350,000 childless women entered the growing labour market . the latest figures will be welcomed by coalition ministers . chancellor george osborne said in his budget speech on wednesday that a key element of the government 's ` massive moment ' in job creation , giving britain its __highest-ever__ employment rate , was ` more women in work than ever before ' . ministers have claimed credit for raising state subsidies for childcare from # 2billion to # 3billion a year since 2010 . but critics of the government 's drive for more mothers to go out to work say many are reluctant to do so and would prefer to stay at home to bring up their children . the historic landmark reached last year means just one mother in four stays at home to raise children -lrb- picture posed by models -rrb- . author and family commentator jill kirby said the figures were a result of government efforts to persuade mothers that ` children are better off in childcare ' , adding : ` children are losing out -- a string of different childcare workers is no substitute for the love of a mother . ' imogen thompson , of the pressure group mothers at home matter , said : ` we question whether this is what all women want , or whether many are forced into returning to the labour market before they feel they , or their children , are ready . ' the new estimates are based on the large-scale labour force survey covering women who either have jobs or are unemployed and looking for work . the ons report said benefit changes that have pressed single parents into looking for work may have influenced the change . it added : ` other government policies , for example to fund 570 hours of free early education childcare a year in england for all three to four-year-olds , will have provided additional incentives to engage with the labour market . ' the biggest change has been among mothers of children under five . in 1996 , 1.6 million of them were in the labour market , compared with 2.1 million last year . this represents a rise from __54.5__ per cent of mothers of __under-fives__ in work in 1996 to 65 per cent now . more mothers of older children are also working , but the rise has been much less steep , while the rates for women without dependents have not changed in nearly 20 years . the report said __74.5__ per cent of all adult women had jobs in 2014 , compared with __71.3__ per cent in 1994 . the most popular jobs for women are either in teaching and education , or ` caring personal services ' , including medical work , or in shops .
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: just one in four mothers stay at home to raise their children , figures reveal . around 74 % of mothers with children under 16 are ` in the labour market ' meanwhile 75 % of women without children are in work or looking for it . in the mid-1990s , only two thirds of britain 's mothers were working .
INFO:tensorflow:GENERATED SUMMARY: just one mother in four stays at home to raise children . figures from the office for national statistics showed 74.1 per cent of women without dependent children were either in work or looking for a job last year . by comparison , 75 per cent of women without dependent children were either in work or looking for a job last year .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  a talented designer has come up with a real ` floating palace ' that is sure to catch the eye of superyacht owners . __lujac__ __desautel__ 's salt concept is very much a luxury item . but it is no __celebrity-style__ __motoryacht__ ; it is a __180ft__ yacht , complete with two masts and huge sails . the living quarters resemble a glass box , offering stunning views 24/7 and the glass area can be folded away so as to open up the yacht and take in the sea air . there are also steps that can be folded down into the sea giving you your very own swimming pool . scroll down for video . __lujac__ __desautel__ 's salt concept is a __180-foot__ vessel with sails instead of a motor that is very much a luxury item . the downstairs area resembled more like a __pool-side__ lounging section , with easy access for a quick dip in the sea . included on board is a dining area that can cater for 12 people , a cocktail bar and even an interior garden . there is one master cabin , two vip cabins and two __twin-bed__ residences . the yacht is a progression from __desautel__ 's glass structure which was inspired by skyscrapers and lego and resembles a gleaming block rising from the sea . instead , this sailing yacht is a somewhat more dreamy offering . ` the world is a laboratory of ideas that can be borrowed , ' __desautel__ writes on his website . ` certain __typologies__ can evolve because they have adoptive features . salt could be thought of as an evolution of these preconceived ideas . ' a walk down to the lower deck offers a stunning balcony view that can also act as a sun trap . the yacht is a progression from __desautel__ 's glass structure which was inspired by skyscrapers and lego . for any crew employed there are also four __twin-bed__ cabins in a separate part of the yacht . on his website __desautel__ describes how he believes ` great design offers an authentic beauty that invites people to consider experiencing the world in a different way ; perhaps a way they never imagined . ' __desautel__ was last year nominated for young designer of the year by boat international media and is a bachelor of architecture student at california college of the arts in the us . although the ideas are only at the ` design ' stage , it is hoped the innovative and futuristic superyacht may well be just what one millionaire is after . the upper deck offers relaxing space , and despite the choppy seas there are plenty of facilities to keep you relaxed on board . benjamin __maltby__ , principal consultant at __matrixlloyd__ -- the worldwide authority on superyacht purchase and construction -- gave mailonline travel his views on the salt concept . ' i really like many of salt 's features . sure , it 's been created by a young designer -- and this shows -- but with a little further investment it could be turned into a glorious , ground-breaking vessel . ` the great thing about superyachts is that no planning permission is needed to build one -- there are just some common sense safety regulations to be met . so buyers can make a floating space that 's truly a reflection of their personalities and aspirations . the superyacht is very much a futuristic design , the brainchild of talented yacht lover __lujac__ __desautel__ . ' i love the __water-yacht__ interfaces . for years , too many designers viewed superyachts as floating houses . it took a long time for the ` beach club ' concept to be accepted -lrb- this is where hinged parts of the hull fold outwards to create platforms down by the water 's edge -rrb- -- now they 're de __rigueur__ for __engine-driven__ superyachts . ` salt 's beach club at the back is an idea that 's not been tried as yet , but it 'd be great as it offers a shady area that 's also surrounded by water on three sides . ` the steps on the side are wonderful , but some thought would be needed as how and where they would be stored when not in use as weight on a sailing superyacht must always be carried as centrally and low as possible to counteract the action of the wind on those sails . '
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: salt is the latest superyacht concept by us based designer __lujac__ __desautel__ . living quarter in the form of a centrally located glass box that can become open air . in keeping with environmental objectives , yacht has sails instead of a motor .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  special bond : gunner amy stevens and __highfield__ -lrb- __h.p__ -rrb- , who is retiring . the poignant message on a tombstone outside the hq of the king 's troop at woolwich army barracks says it all : ` here lies an old horse called wonder , his extraordinary age being forty years old when he died . this stone was placed august 1 , __1808__ . ' of course , that was back in the days when horses really went to war . one can only imagine the battles wonder courageously survived . but the fact that wonder lived to such a ripe old age -- in human years , well over 100 -- is testament to the fact that even when horses were used on battlefields , the british army valued and looked after them . today , the four-legged members of the king 's troop royal horse artillery housed at woolwich do n't have to charge at the enemy , thank goodness . they perform only ceremonial duties , such as trooping the colour , state funerals and military tattoos . the worst they have to cope with is galloping through theatrical smoke at the horse of the year show . what 's more , they live in a luxurious state-of-the-art equestrian training facility , with an army of grooms tending to their every need . they enjoy 24-hour care , with a dedicated vet and __farrier__ on site . they are exercised daily in the arena or hacked out in nearby charlton park . once a year they go on a four-week summer holiday to melton mowbray in leicestershire , where they spend time out at grass . and yet , despite this , animal rights activists launched a withering attack on the mod last month , accusing the army of being cruel to horses . campaigners from peta -lrb- people for the ethical treatment of animals -rrb- claimed the military should not be allowed to keep any animals at all . they seized on figures showing the mod had put down 109 of their horses in the past six years as evidence of neglect . anyone with experience of horses -- like me -- will tell you that figure is actually quite modest considering the mod has 500 horses in its care at any one time at woolwich , where the king 's troop is stationed , and at knightsbridge , where the household cavalry is based . activists singled out figures showing that horses were put down because they fell lame or suffered from __colic__ . they suggested the mod did not try hard enough to __re-home__ horses who could no longer work . again , any horse owner will know that __colic__ and leg injuries in __equines__ are all too often serious enough to warrant euthanasia and that it is sometimes the only option . however , this did n't stop the activists . mimi __bekhechi__ , director of peta , complained : ` the ministry of defence has no business using horses , dogs or any other animals . they are not soldiers , nor are they pieces of military kit to be used and then decommissioned at the end of their involuntary service . ` while painless euthanasia is the only humane option for sick or wounded animals , a combat zone is no place for them . ' but no horses are used in combat now . what the animal rights lobby appear to be campaigning for , therefore , is an end to the role of horses at official events . this is a worrying development . the artillery fire a 41 gun royal salute in green park in honour of her majesty the queen 's 87th birthday . they perform only ceremonial duties , such as trooping the colour , state funerals and military tattoos . for anyone who feels proud to watch the magnificent spectacle of our gleaming military horses on parade at buckingham palace or on the mall , it seems unthinkable . what 's more , anyone who visits the woolwich base can see that they are incredibly well cared for . by any standards , the king 's troop headquarters is an amazing facility . everywhere you look , soldiers are sweeping , scrubbing and polishing . the horses are in peak condition . their coats are glossy , __manes__ neatly trimmed . if they actually bothered to visit , the naysayers would see that the horses look as happy as can be . as he shows me round the stable blocks , captain nick watson explains that the soldiers become incredibly attached to the animals in their care . they put years of painstaking work into training them . almost all are bought as four-year-olds , mostly from ireland , and stay in service until 18 . every effort is then made to find them civilian homes where they can kick up their heels . but military chiefs readily admit it can be tricky finding the right home . it is not just a simple case of turning them loose in a field or handing them over to the first person who comes through the door . these are working animals who are used to an interesting and varied life . on parade , the unit 's soldiers drive a team of six of the horses with each pulling world war i field gun . they perform in front of massive crowds and so it is imperative that they stay calm and perform their duties __unflustered__ . those coming up to retirement age include 18-year-old doughnut , a quiet bay mare who __nuzzles__ me gently when i pet her over her stable door . a typical ` war horse ' , according to her handlers , she never makes a fuss . she featured in last year 's trooping the colour and will take part in the queen 's birthday parade again in june this year -- one last time , perhaps . like the rest of the troop , doughnut is smaller than the huge black horses of the household cavalry . the king 's troop features some horses who are just over 15 hands -lrb- 5ft -rrb- , so they are lighter to manoeuvre . ` she 's awesome , ' says sgt andrew __higson__ , who rode doughnut at the last british military tournament to take place at earl 's court , in 2013 . ` she 's had more outings than people have had hot dinners . she 's worth her weight in gold . anyone new who ca n't ride when they come here , we put them on her and she looks after them . ' they will miss her terribly , but want her to go to a home where she wo n't be overworked . the king 's troop horses pictured in 1952 , leading king george vi 's through wet london streets . ` she has had a full career , ' says sgt kathryn charters . ` so , we want her to take it easy . our vet will stipulate that she is rehomed only to someone who will not do too much with her , perhaps just lightly hack her . ' another horse they will be sad to lose when he retires is junior , also 18 . as he __gallops__ and bucks around the arena , you can see how incredibly fit he still is for his age , perhaps living up to his name . junior has performed in all the queen 's birthday parades , the windsor horse show , the british military tattoo , the horse of the year show and the olympia horse show . like doughnut , he featured in last year 's trooping the colour and will again this year . whenever a horse is deemed unfit to work , it goes through a process called ` casting ' , whereby it is found a new home . the military never needs to advertise because there are always willing takers . the horses are sold in a negotiation that involves the potential new owner putting in a bid . only if it is reasonable is it accepted . do you like to save your stale bread to feed the ducks ? beware -- wildlife experts are warning that the starchy snack is the equivalent of ` junk food ' for the birds . each year six million loaves are tossed into british waterways by well-intentioned people , says the canal & river trust . but the charity says that not only is all this bread unhealthy for ducks , it also encourages rats and algae to thrive . it is advising people to feed ducks with snacks such as __defrosted__ peas and __sweetcorn__ , chopped lettuce and halved grapes . seeds , oats and even leftover takeaway rice also get the thumbs up . anyone who does want to __rehome__ a ` war horse ' has to go through a strict process in which they must trial ride them and sign a contract __stipulating__ what they may do with them . h __ighfield__ , or h. p. for short , a handsome bay mare with a distinctive stripe down her face , is due for rehoming in the next six months . ` she 's got so many letters in her folder from people who want her , ' says sgt charters . one horse who was successfully retired recently is bert , or mr twister , to give him his formal title . a 15-year-old black charger who had been with the troop since 2005 , he was the lead horse in baroness thatcher 's funeral procession . as thousands lined the streets of london to watch the former prime minister 's funeral cortege in 2013 , bert stayed steady as a rock as he walked in front of the gun carriage . sadly , he had started to suffer from osteoarthritis , so his duties had to come to an end . due to his medical issues , bert needed an expert home , so in february he was taken to the horse trust for retired horses in princes __risborough__ , bucks . any suggestion that the military should be prevented from having horses seems ludicrous when you think how much care and attention is paid to their needs at every stage of their life , right into their old age . and when you consider what would be lost if britain did not have ceremonial horses , as well as the traditional skills that would disappear , it seems little short of an outrage that an animal welfare group would call for these horses to lose their jobs . ` this is what makes us great britain , ' says capt watson . ` if they got rid of the ceremonial side of the army a lot of tourism would go . ' there is clearly a special bond between the horses and their handlers . ` they eat before us , they get seen to before we do anything for ourselves . they have a better life than most horses , ' says one soldier . little wonder , therefore , that some of the soldiers end up taking the older horses home themselves . a few years ago , sgt charters re-homed a horse called moose back to her family home in devon , where her mother runs a livery yard . she is now 22 and enjoying giving pony rides to children as part of the riding for the disabled scheme . such stories are a tribute to the bond between horses and soldiers . and as the tombstones to veteran __steeds__ testify , war horses are never incidental or forgotten . they may not fight for their country these days , but they still do britain an amazing service by putting on the pageantry for which we are world-renowned . it seems so sad to think that if the animal rights lobby get their way such a key part of our heritage could be lost . it 's enough to make old wonder turn in his grave .
