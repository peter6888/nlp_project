' i think it is natural as parents to ask the questions : could more have been done to save kieran , did he suffer , what went wrong and what can be done to prevent this from ever happening to another family ? ` it is like we have an open wound that we can not close because we do n't have the resources at our disposal . ` the hole in our life left by kieran will always be there - all the future we would have had together is missing . ` it 's so difficult not being able yet to point at something positive to come from this tragedy - some safety improvements that we can say were made as a result of what we learned from kieran 's death . ` hopefully , the trial will help us understand . ' mrs brookes , 52 , also an nhs manager , said : ` he was academically bright but also loved to be physically active and was a member of the army cadets . ` kieran dreamed of becoming a doctor and helping people . he wanted to be a gp . we could n't bury kieran for six months because of the police investigation . ` we also could n't donate his organs which was something that would have given us some comfort . the comfort that we 're looking for now is that we can say that something good came of this , that lessons have been learnt from this which will make things safer . ' the family 's lawyer mark __montaldo__ , of slater and gordon , said : ` the french prosecutor has enough evidence to bring two charges of involuntary manslaughter in this case against the pilot of the ski lift and the company which employed him . ` it has been devastating for kieran 's family to lose a much-loved son in these circumstances . but they are determined that the full facts of what happened are revealed and any safety failings exposed so that no other family has to suffer a similar tragedy again .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  scientists wanting to develop a spacecraft carrying a nuclear device to blow up asteroids are preparing to seek funding this year . called the hyper velocity asteroid impact vehicle -lrb- __haiv__ -rrb- , their system would be able to launch and reach an __earth-bound__ asteroid within 100 days or so , destroying it before it reached our planet . but the unmanned spacecraft relies on one crucial aspect - tracking and finding an asteroid , before it is too late to stop it impacting earth . scroll down for video . boom ! a danish ngo is planning to develop an __earth-saving__ spacecraft called the hyper velocity asteroid impact vehicle -lrb- __haiv__ -rrb- . in the diagram above , ned stands for nuclear explosive device . the front of the spacecraft would create a small crater , which the nuclear device would then travel in to and explode . the concept was created by the emergency asteroid defence project -lrb- __eadp__ -rrb- , based in denmark . they are seeking to find a way to protect earth from destruction when all other methods have failed . ranging from # 340 million to $ 1 billion -lrb- $ 500 million to $ 1.5 billion -rrb- , the cost of the mission would depend on how large the incoming asteroid that needed to be destroyed was . called the __hypervelocity__ asteroid intercept vehicle , or __haiv__ , the craft would rendezvous with an asteroid in deep space . it consists of a fore body -lrb- a leader spacecraft -rrb- , which would hit the comet and create blast crater . a few seconds later , an __aft__ body -lrb- a follower spacecraft -rrb- carrying nuclear explosives would hit inside the crater - which increases its effectiveness by up to 20 times . once an asteroid had been located , the __haiv__ would be launched on one of several possible rockets , including a delta iv or atlas v . the __haiv__ would then align itself such that it would impact the asteroid , by matching its orbit . the concept works using a ` leader ' and a ` follower ' spacecraft . after the launch , the former would separate and impact the asteroid , forming a crater in its surface . the follower , carrying a nuclear warhead , would then enter the crater and explode , blowing the asteroid to pieces . these pieces would either be deflected from earth , or would be too small to cause any considerable damage . this diagram shows a simulation of the area affected if something the size of halley 's comet , with a diameter of approximately 6.2 miles -lrb- 10km -rrb- , hit the us - a possible global extinction event . this simulation shows the area that would be affected , if a medium asteroid __330ft__ -lrb- 100 metres -rrb- in diameter hit london . the __eadp__ team says there is a significant threat of an asteroid hitting earth . shown is a diagram of how the spacecraft might look , with the nuclear device in the middle . sensors at the front direct the spacecraft towards its target , before it impacts . last year , the __privately-funded__ __b612__ foundation discovered that earth is up to 10 times more likely to be hit than previously thought . while the majority of the impacts occur either high up in the atmosphere , or in __unpopulated__ areas including the atlantic and pacific oceans , the danger was still ever-present . the findings were based on information released from the __nuclear-test-ban__ treaty organisation . this operates a network of sensors that monitor earth around the clock listening for the __infrasound__ signatures of nuclear __detonations__ . but what these sensors found were not nuclear explosions , but rather asteroid impacts on a huge scale . between 2000 and 2013 the network detected 26 explosions on earth ranging in energy from one to 600 __kilotons__ - all caused by asteroid impacts . it relies upon near-earth objects -lrb- __neos__ -rrb- being tracked , so that the threat of one hitting earth can be measured in advance . if a potentially dangerous object is identified , the spacecraft can then be launched and sent on its mission to blow it up , before it has a chance to threaten earth . ` the mission of preparing humanity for a potential asteroid collision is something that should have done a long time ago , ' the team writes on their website . ` we , as an advanced species , have had the basic technology for about half a century . ` events like the one in chelyabinsk , in 2013 , could have been avoided if adequate detection and deflection missions had been developed . ' launching a nuclear device into space may not be as easy as the team thinks , as there are a number of legal issues to do so . however , they say there are no safety issues with launching a nuclear device and , as the __haiv__ will be hitting an asteroid so far into space , ` no nuclear material , radiation or shock wave will reach earth . ' they continued : ` legal complications or not , we do however believe that if , say , a sizeable asteroid is headed towards a city like new york , moscow or beijing , we will as a team be able to gather the global support to get a mandate to act regardless of otherwise existing legal __obstructions__ , if needed in order to save the lives of millions ! ' and on whether it is illegal to send nuclear explosives into space , they said : ` probably not , as long as it is not a weapon . ' last year experts warned that we must do more to track asteroids , as one could cause widespread damage to the planet . most notably , in february 2013 , hundreds of people were injured when a meteor exploded near the city of chelyabinsk in russia - the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century . on the left is a typical journey for the __haiv__ vehicle to intercept an asteroid that could dangerous to earth . in this instance it would take 121 days to stop the asteroid before it hit , illustrated right . in the 1998 movie armageddon , pictured , bruce willis must save earth from an asteroid by flying to the space rock and blowing it up with a bomb . the team is now looking to raise # __675,000__ to # __6.75__ million -lrb- $ 1 million to $ 10 million -rrb- in the next year or so , through crowdfunding sites like kickstarter . by 2018 , they want to build a version of __haiv__ that could destroy an asteroid __165ft__ -lrb- 50 metres -rrb- across . and by the end of the decade , they want to be ready to stop asteroids up to __985ft__ -lrb- 300 metres -rrb- in size - which account for 99.9 per cent of asteroids near earth . they note that their method , using a nuclear device , should be considered a last resort and only used if other methods have failed . such methods could include hitting an asteroid with laser to deflect it , or __rebounding__ solar rays into it to have the same effect . ` however , in extreme cases with less than one year warning time and when all __non-nuclear__ methods fail , we believe the __haiv__ system is the only and most appropriate technique currently available to defend earth , ' the team said in a statement .
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: a danish ngo is planning to develop __earth-saving__ spacecraft . hyper velocity asteroid impact vehicle -lrb- __haiv__ -rrb- will be a ` rapid ' response . it will blow up asteroids that could endanger earth using a nuclear device . but this should only be a last resort when other methods have failed .

' i love the feeling of pressure and only take it off for an hour a day to rest and to wash myself . ' the 25-year-old model began __waist-training__ while still in her teens and now with her enhanced __34dd__ breasts she draws stares wherever she goes . she said : ` people stop what they 're doing and stare - everywhere i go i get attention . ` people shout at me in the street - they ca n't believe that my figure is real . but wearing a corset took some getting used to - at first it was terrible and uncomfortable . ` after a while it became a necessity and when i 'm not wearing it my skin would itch . but it 's not pain - it 's more pleasure , i like the pressure . i do n't feel a thing , it does n't bother me at all . ' __aleira__ 's doctors have said that her extreme __waist-training__ could lead to complications later in life . in this shot it is clear to see how much smaller __aleira__ 's waist is to the rest of her body . but __aleira__ 's doctor fears that her stringent regime could lead to complications later on in life . dr __andrés__ ruiz , said : ` in my medical opinion she should stop this __immediately.thank__ god she has not done any damage so far but she should stop before it 's too late . ` it happens because the floating ribs at the bottom of the rib cage are easier to mold - it 's definitely possible to achieve this waist without surgery . ' along with the waist training , __aleira__ tries to keep her hourglass shape by eating right and dieting . she added : ' i only eat very small portions mainly egg whites , pineapple , lots of fruit and a little bit of meat - i have a very balanced diet . i do crunches , weights and whatever i can to stay in shape .

' unsurprisingly she draws both adulation and criticism whenever she hits the streets of caracas in venezuela - with people even comparing her to an alien . she said : ` they say that i 've had too much surgery , that i do n't have ribs and that i 'm a man . it is totally false - people even say that i am an extraterrestrial and a transsexual . ' but she considers wearing a corset for 23 hours a day a small price to pay for the happiness it brings her . she added : ` this is the best thing that has happened to me . i would like to be known for my waist , not for having the smallest waist in the world but rather for my waist and my entire body . ` that would be one of my ambitions , to be very well known for the shape of my body . other than having a small waist i also want to be considered sexy . ' recently cinderella star lily james came under fire for having worn a corset during the filming of the new film . actress lily james has come under fire for wearing a corset in the new cinderella film which has given her a tiny waist . many have commented that the characters waist is too small and gives young viewers unrealistic expectations of how they should look . lily even admitted that she could n't eat properly during filming saying : ` when -lsb- the corset -rsb- was on we would be on continuous days , so we would n't stop for lunch or a lovely tea like this . you 'd be sort of eating on the move . in that case , i could n't __untie__ the corset . ` if you ate food it did n't really digest properly , and i 'd be __burping__ all afternoon in -lsb- richard madden 's -rsb- face , and it was just really sort of unpleasant . i 'd have soup so that i could still eat but it would n't get stuck .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  a foetus at 24 weeks . new advice from the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists rules against so-called souvenir scans before 10 weeks . souvenir scans of the unborn baby should not be carried out in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy , say doctors . such keepsake images are shown off by proud __parents-to-be__ , who can buy special wallets and photo frames to mark every stage of pregnancy . but new advice from the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists rules against the growing trend when there is no medical reason for doing an early-stage scan . a new scientific review says ultrasound -- which uses high-frequency sound waves to provide images of the foetus -- could expose it to unknown risks . although there is no evidence of harm , the ` precautionary principle ' should apply , it says . dr christoph lees , reader in obstetrics and fetal medicine at imperial college london and lead author of the paper said the review looked specifically at the first 10 weeks in the womb . normally a scan would be ordered only for a potential problem identified by a clinician and in those circumstances it was perfectly safe , he said . but an increasing number of clinics were offering keepsake images from as early as six weeks , he said . he said : ` ultrasound scanning in the embryonic period is an invaluable resource in several important scenarios where the embryo is at possible risk . ` there are presently no grounds for questioning the safety of diagnostic ultrasound in this context . ` however , ultrasound imaging is increasingly being used without obvious medical justification and we have to be aware of the possibility of subtle long-term adverse effects , particularly in the first weeks of gestation when the embryo is potentially the most vulnerable . ' a pregnant woman looks towards a scan of her unborn baby . an increasing number of clinics are offering keepsake images from as early as six weeks . dr christoph less of imperial college is the lead author of the paper which advises against scans of foetuses during the first 10 weeks in the womb unless they are done for medical reasons . the review was produced by the scientific advisory committee at the __rcog__ to provide doctors with up-to-date information about the issue . the us food and drug administration issued similar advice in december , saying excess ultrasound at any stage in pregnancy should be avoided . dr lees said one of the possible harms might come from the slight heating effect produced by ultrasound which was more easily dissipated by the placenta after 10 weeks of pregnancy . he said the safest period for taking souvenir scans was 20 weeks of pregnancy and beyond . the review highlights the various types of ultrasound , including __b-mode__ -- the most commonly used form of ultrasound in obstetrics -- colour and pulse wave __doppler__ . colour and __pulsed__ wave __doppler__ involve greater average intensity and power __outputs__ than __b-mode__ and are not recommended at all during the first 10 weeks . additionally , there has been a move to perform 3d and 4d ultrasound scans earlier in pregnancy , states the paper . colour and __pulsed__ wave __doppler__ scans have such intensity and power output they are not recommended at all during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy . 4d ultrasound is ` real time ' scanning and involves higher power __outputs__ as the scanning time is longer , typically by several minutes , and should not be the sole purpose of souvenir images or video recordings in early pregnancy . dr __sadaf__ __ghaem-maghami__ , chair of the __rcog__ 's scientific advisory committee , said ` __b-mode__ ultrasound used for clinical reasons from conception to 10 weeks of gestation is safe and the benefits outweigh any theoretical risks . ` we are adopting a precautionary approach and are highlighting the small but possible risks to women so that they can make informed choices . ` we also emphasise that any healthcare professional involved in the use of ultrasound is aware of the safety principles of ultrasound . '
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists rules against trend . some clinics are offering keepsake images from as early as six weeks . advice says early-stage scans should not be done without medical reason . slight heating effect produced by ultrasound is one subtle side effect . colour and __pulsed__ wave __doppler__ scans have such intensity and power output they are not recommended at all during first 10 weeks .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  interest rates are unlikely to rise until the middle of next year as the bank of england tries to stave off a __deflationary__ spiral , economists said last night . official figures revealed the inflation rate fell to 0 per cent last month -- the lowest level since 1960 . experts warned britain is now just one month away from deflation as food and petrol prices continue to tumble . the dramatic fall in the cost of goods is likely to push back the timing of an interest rates hike by the bank of england . delaying a rates rise would mean continued rock-bottom interest rates for mortgage borrowers , but more misery for savers . the base rate has been held at a historic low 0.5 per cent for six years but the bank of england has admitted that , far from raising rates , it could even cut them further to avoid prolonged deflation . lower rates would encourage people to spend , rather than save , stimulating demand and pushing up prices . ben __brettell__ , senior economist at __stockbrokers__ hargreaves lansdown , said : ` it appears interest rates will be stuck at 0.5 per cent for some time yet -- i do n't see them rising until __mid-2016__ at the very earliest . the office for national statistics found the consumer prices index between february 2014 and february 2015 stood at 0 per cent . with wages rising by 1.6 per cent while prices are flat , it means families should see their money going further each month . ` the bank raises rates to curb inflation , but that is obviously not a problem at the moment , so they will keep them on hold . ' john __hawksworth__ , of pricewaterhousecoopers , said the bank was now ` under no immediate pressure to raise interest rates ' . andrew __haldane__ , the bank 's chief economist , suggested earlier this month that rates could be cut to zero because inflation had ` dropped like a stone ' . low inflation , and even deflation , over a short period can be good for the economy and boost family finances , but a continuous fall in prices is harmful . by alex __brummer__ . the good news . ... and the bad news . bargain prices in shops could be used by employers as an excuse to keep wages low , while workers could delay big purchases in anticipation that costs will fall further -- triggering a downward spiral . yesterday , prime minister david cameron seemed unconcerned by predictions that prices would fall further , saying britain did not ` face the dangerous deflation that some other parts of europe may potentially have a problem with ' . he welcomed the lowest inflation rate in 55 years , saying it was ` good news for family budgets ' , while chancellor george osborne declared that ` prices are frozen ' . estimates released by the office for national statistics show the last time inflation was below 0 per cent was march 1960 -- when harold macmillan was prime minister and the beatles had just formed in liverpool . the last major bout of deflation came during the great depression from 1929 to 1932 . it did not end until britain abandoned the gold standard which the then chancellor winston churchill embraced in 1925 . before that , in the late 19th century the prices of goods , property and shares fell sharply provoking a banking crisis similar in scale and danger to that of 2007 to 2009 . in the early 18th century the value of the pound was fixed against gold and prices were flat and falling until the outbreak of the napoleonic wars . inflation measures the rise and fall of 700 goods and services , from energy prices to clothing . but it is the plummeting cost of petrol , diesel and food that has dragged down the rate to zero . in the past year , there has been a huge fall in the cost of global wholesale oil , causing prices at the pump to tumble by almost 17 per cent . an aggressive supermarket price war has also dragged down the inflation rate , as major stores have been forced to compete with budget rivals such as aldi and lidl . the ons reported that food prices had fallen by more than 3 per cent in february compared with a year earlier . economist vicky redwood , at capital economics , said : ` the uk is now within a whisker of deflation . ` it looks odds-on that inflation will turn negative in march , when the recent cut in gas prices by british gas show up in the inflation figures for the first time . we still think that deflation in the uk will be a `` good '' development , giving households ' incomes a welcome boost and supporting the economic recovery this year . ' rob wood , of __berenberg__ bank , said there was ` a good chance inflation could turn negative next month ' . economist chris williamson , at __markit__ , said : ` rather than being a concern , the drop in inflation is a boon to the economy , providing households with greater spending power at a time when pay growth remains frustratingly weak . ' chief secretary to the treasury danny alexander said that , as pay rises pull ahead of price increases , people had more money in their pockets , helping ` millions of families ' . but shadow treasury minister cathy jamieson said it was external factors that had brought down inflation , rather than the government 's economic policy . she said : ` a few months of falling world oil prices wo n't solve the deep-seated problems in our economy . ' since 2010 , we 've been working through our long-term economic plan to turn britain around . it has n't been easy -- we inherited a country on the brink of bankruptcy -- and i know many of you will have made huge personal sacrifices to support our plan to mend the broken economy and secure a brighter future for this great nation . but it 's been worth it . that plan is working . day by day , month by month , britain 's getting stronger : jobs are on the rise , the deficit 's down , the economy 's growing and wages are going further . and there 's more good news for family budgets , with the inflation figures announced today at a record low of zero per cent . david cameron told mailonline the figures were ` more good news for family budgets ' and proof the government 's economic plan is working . at a time when the world economy is increasingly unstable , these latest figures are a reminder that we 're on the right track -- and that doing things differently would put it all at risk . it 's a reminder that only the conservatives have a plan to build a stronger economy , improve living standards and make families across britain more financially secure . we want to help hardworking people keep more of the money they earn . it is individuals -- not governments -- who know best how to spend their money . that 's why , in government , we 've cut income tax for 26 million by raising the personal allowance to over # 10,000 -- and we will go further in the next parliament . that 's why we 've frozen fuel duty for the longest time in 20 years , saving a typical family # 10 each time they fill up . that 's why we 've secured the biggest ever cash rise in the state pension , which will be # 950 higher than it was in 2010 . that 's why we 're introducing tax-free childcare -- helping out parents with hefty childcare bills . that 's why we provided funding to freeze council tax bills , putting more money in hardworking taxpayers ' pockets . do n't just take me by my word . judge me by my record in government : we 've delivered 2 million quality apprenticeships in the past five years , and will deliver 3 million more in the next five -- giving young people the skills to go out and get a well-paid job . we 're backing business , industry and enterprise -- creating 1,000 jobs a day and driving down unemployment - now at its lowest level since 2008 . we 're getting britain building again , helping young people to own their own home . we 've already announced 200,000 cut-price homes for first-time buyers under 40 . and we will now help first-time buyers save for a deposit . a strong economy is the backbone of a strong nation . and a strong nation is built on people who work hard and want to get on life . mums and dads working round the clock to put food on the table and do the best they can for their children ; grandparents who 've saved hard all their lives to support their loved ones in times of need ; sons and daughters who want to get on with their lives , get a job , get a home , and make something of themselves . a conservative government after may 8 will carry on working through our plan to secure a brighter future for you , your family and for britain . step by step , milestone after milestone . last week it was a record increase in the minimum wage , today it 's the rate of inflation . this government has a long-term plan -- and we 're determined to make it work for you .

' yet all end up at the sewage works and many metals end up in the leftover solid waste . at treatment plants , wastewater goes through a series of physical , biological and chemical processes and the end products are treated water and __biosolids__ . in the us alone seven million tons are leftover each year with half used as fertiliser on fields and in forests and the other half incinerated or sent to landfills . dr smith added : ` we have a __two-pronged__ approach . ` in one part of the study , we are looking at removing some regulated metals from the __biosolids__ that limit their use for land application . if britain 's waste was mined it could be worth $ __762__ million -lrb- # 510 million -rrb- a year . previous research estimated the waste from one million americans could contain as much as $ 12 million -lrb- # 8.7 million -rrb- worth of metals . ` in the other part of the project , we 're interested in collecting valuable metals that could be sold , including some of the more technologically important metals , such as __vanadium__ and copper that are in cell phones , computers and __alloys__ . ' the study aims to use the same chemicals , called __leachates__ , which the mining industry uses to pull metals out of rock . while some of these __leachates__ have a bad reputation for damaging ecosystems when they leak or spill into the environment , in a controlled setting , they could safely be used to recover metals in treated solid waste . in the treated waste researchers already started to discover metals like platinum , silver and gold observing __microscopic-sized__ metal particles in __biosolids__ using a scanning electron microscope . ` the gold we found was at the level of a minimal mineral deposit ' meaning if that amount were in rock , it might be commercially viable to mine it . dr smith added that ` the economic and technical feasibility of metal recovery from __biosolids__ needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis . ' the study presented at the __249th__ national meeting & __exposition__ of the american chemical society -lrb- __acs__ -rrb- involved collecting samples from small towns in the rocky mountains , rural communities and big cities . for a more comprehensive picture , they plan to combine their information with many years ' worth of existing data collected by the environmental protection agency and other groups at the geological survey .

to __13-foot__ -lrb- 2 - to 4 meter -rrb- wide boulder . the mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation orion multi-purpose crew vehicle . after the orion and the asteroid are attached , the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object . once the orion docks with the __remote-operated__ asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows . after the mission is complete , orion returns to earth on the same path it journeyed out on , loops around the moon included , and splashes down in an ocean - likely the pacific - 10 days later . the mission is seen as an important step towards eventually sending humans to mars and returning them safely . ` i 'm going to have multiple targets ... we can assess which . one we want to go after and i then have three - to five tries to . get it , or i can move on to a different one , ' lightfoot said . the captured boulder , which would remain attached to the . probe , would then be nudged into an orbit circling high around . the moon , a maneuver expected to take about six years . the probe would include a docking ring so a nasa orion . spaceship , carrying two astronauts , could reach the asteroid , a . mission targeted for around 2025 . nasa 's ultimate goal is to send humans to mars , and they say the asteroid redirect mission -lrb- arm -rrb- will be an important stepping stone towards getting there . a number of new spaceflight capabilities will be tested in the 2020s as part of the mission , which will involve __redirecting__ an asteroid to orbit the moon and sending humans to explore it . astronauts aboard nasa 's orion spacecraft , launched from the upcoming space launch system -lrb- sls -rrb- rocket , will then explore the asteroid in the __mid-2020s__ at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon . nasa plans to launch an arm robotic spacecraft to rendezvous with , capture and redirect an asteroid by the end of this decade . the spacecraft will redirect it to a stable orbit around the moon called a ` distant __retrograde__ orbit ' - one that orbits the moon very widely , coming quite close before extending out much further away . astronauts aboard nasa 's orion spacecraft , launched from the upcoming space launch system -lrb- sls -rrb- rocket , will then explore the asteroid in the __mid-2020s__ at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon . within the papers , authors explain the current work taking place across the country to examine options for these robotic and crewed missions . this includes advanced solar electric propulsion -lrb- sep -rrb- - one of the critical technologies needed to send larger payloads into deep space and to the mars system . sep - or ion propulsion - creates thrust powered by solar arrays , which transforms sunlight into electromagnetic fields that accelerate and expel charged atoms -lrb- ions -rrb- . this is a very efficient way to power a spacecraft and significantly cuts down on the amount of fuel a spacecraft needs to carry , which can be heavy and expensive to launch from earth . an asteroid named __itokawa__ photographed by the __hayabusa__ probe . the agency plans to announce the specific asteroid selected for the mission no earlier than 2019 , approximately a year before launching the robotic spacecraft . before an asteroid is considered a valid candidate for the mission , scientists must first determine its characteristics , in addition to size , such as rotation , shape and precise orbit . nasa has identified three valid candidates for the mission so far : __itokawa__ , __bennu__ and 2008 __ev5__ . the agency expects to identify one or two additional candidates each year leading up to the mission . returning asteroid samples will help nasa develop tools and techniques for future space exploration . this early experience with raw materials could also help advance our ability to make use of natural resources in space . rocky bodies like asteroids and our moon could hold enough oxygen and hydrogen to create breathable air , drinkable water or even components for rocket fuel . there also is growing interest in the commercial space industry to potentially mine asteroids for resources in the future . with this in mind some of the papers outline ways in which arm might benefit future commercial activities at asteroids - namely collecting resources for use back on earth or in space . current studies at nasa detailed in the papers are examining ways sep will be used to power the arm robotic mission . nasa was also working on a mission concept that would fully __enclose__ a large asteroid using an inflatable system and the other would capture a smaller boulder from of a much larger asteroid using robotic arms . the arm crewed mission , in which astronauts will explore the redirected asteroid around the moon , provides unique opportunities to test human spaceflight capabilities as well . the papers detail current work underway at nasa to upgrade spacesuits in preparation for the first spacewalks in deep space since the 1960s and farther from earth than ever before . concepts for new hardware to dock the crewed and __uncrewed__ spacecraft together are also in development . this will allow the crew aboard orion to attach to the arm robotic spacecraft and study the asteroid . this could be later used to connect orion with a deep space habitat or ` stepping stone ' on its way to mars , or even station cargo and fuel depots in strategic places such as lunar orbit . astronauts returning home with samples from mars will hold a treasure trove of research scientists will study to unlock new knowledge about mars and the solar system 's history . various techniques for deflecting a potentially hazardous asteroid could be tested on arm to enable planetary defense capabilities . these techniques include ion beam deflection , enhanced gravity tractor , and kinetic __impactors__ . in ion beam deflection , the plumes from the thrusters would be directed towards the asteroid to gently push on its surface over a wide area . a __thruster__ firing in the opposite direction would be needed to keep the spacecraft at a constant distance from the asteroid . the ion beam deflection approach is independent of the size of the asteroid , and it could be demonstrated on either mission option . in the enhanced gravity tractor approach , the spacecraft would first pick up a boulder from the asteroid 's surface as in mission option b . the spacecraft with the collected boulder would then orbit in a circular halo around the asteroid 's velocity __vector__ . the mass of the boulder coupled with the mass of the spacecraft would increase the gravitational attraction between the spacecraft and the asteroid . by flying the spacecraft in close formation with the asteroid for several months the very small gravitational forces would produce a measurable change in the asteroid 's trajectory . a kinetic __impactor__ could also be launched as a secondary payload with the spacecraft or on a separate launch vehicle , and it would collide with the target asteroid at high velocity while the spacecraft observed the impact . as well as this , returning asteroid samples will help nasa develop tools and techniques for future space exploration . this early experience with raw materials could also help advance our ability to make use of natural resources in space . rocky bodies like asteroids and our moon could hold enough oxygen and hydrogen to create breathable air , drinkable water or even components for rocket fuel . there also is growing interest in the commercial space industry to potentially mine asteroids for resources in the future . with this in mind some of the papers outline ways in which arm might benefit future commercial activities at asteroids - namely collecting resources for use back on earth or in space .

' clayton was convicted of gunning down christopher __castetter__ , a sheriff 's deputy in rural southwest missouri 's barry county . __castetter__ was 29 and a father-of-three when he went to a home near __cassville__ on thanksgiving eve 1996 to check on a suspicious vehicle report . authorities said clayton shot __castetter__ once in the forehead while the deputy was in his car , which was found against a tree , its engine racing and wheels spinning . clayton 's brother had testified that the __sawmill__ accident led to clayton 's breakup from his wife , alcohol abuse and violent outbursts . the lethal injection , clayton 's attorneys said , was ` sure or very likely to cause excruciating or tortuous pain and needless suffering ' in light of his dementia . ` if missouri proceeds with its scheduled execution of mr. clayton , it will be conducting an unregulated experiment on a human subject , as there are no studies that support -lrb- the prison system 's -rrb- use of missouri 's lethal injection protocol on an individual suffering from severe brain damage , ' the appeals on clayton 's behalf argued . killed : barry county sheriff 's deputy christopher __castetter__ , pictured left , was shot dead by clayton , pictured right in an old mug shot , as he responded to a call about a suspicious vehicle in 1996 . at the weekend , when the missouri supreme court issued its decision , three of the seven judges agreed that clayton was entitled to a competency hearing . mental health professionals who examined him agreed that he was mentally impaired and had mental health issues , including dementia . his most recent iq test had found him to have an iq of just 71 , which is 29 points below average . ` he is not simply incompetent legally ; he would be unable to care for himself or manage basic __self-care__ , were he not in a structured environment that takes care of him , ' according to a doctor who examined him , the kansas city star reported . ` he can shower , groom , eat , walk ; it is his comprehension , judgment , memory , limited intelligence and social deficits that plague him . ' in missouri , the director of the department of corrections is the only one with the authority to order a competency hearing , and last year , he called on a doctor to examine clayton . dr. james reynolds of the missouri department of mental health had concluded that clayton was mentally ill , but could not be certain that he did n't understand his death sentence . but clayton 's lawyers said , while he had conversations in which he understood he was about to be executed , he would later forget that conversation ever happened . his family also called for a fair hearing on the issue . execution : he was put to death at the state prison in __bonne__ terre , pictured , on tuesday night . death : his family and lawyers had argued that he was __child-like__ and did not understand the significance of his death penalty . they had called for his execution at __bonne__ terre -lrb- pictured -rrb- to be stopped . ` he is brain-damaged , and talking with him is like talking to a child , ' clayton 's daughter , jena clayton , said during his clemency petition , the kansas city star reported . ' i do not believe we are the kind of country that executes the disabled . ' at the execution , department of corrections director george a. lombardi read a statement from governor jay nixon , in which he praised the work of __castetter__ . ` our state is safer because there are brave officers , like deputy __castetter__ , who are willing to sacrifice their own safety for that of others , ' he said . ` as the sentence of his murderer was carried out this evening , i ask __missourians__ tonight to honor deputy __castetter__ , who gave his life in service to our state , and to remember him and his family in their thoughts and prayers .

' mrs brookes , 52 , also an nhs manager , said : ` he was academically bright but also loved to be physically active and was a member of the army cadets . ` kieran dreamed of becoming a doctor and helping people . he wanted to be a gp . we could n't bury kieran for six months because of the police investigation . ` we also could n't donate his organs which was something that would have given us some comfort . the comfort that we 're looking for now is that we can say that something good came of this , that lessons have been learnt from this which will make things safer . ' the family 's lawyer mark __montaldo__ , of slater and gordon , said : ` the french prosecutor has enough evidence to bring two charges of involuntary manslaughter in this case against the pilot of the ski lift and the company which employed him . ` it has been devastating for kieran 's family to lose a much-loved son in these circumstances . but they are determined that the full facts of what happened are revealed and any safety failings exposed so that no other family has to suffer a similar tragedy again .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  scientists wanting to develop a spacecraft carrying a nuclear device to blow up asteroids are preparing to seek funding this year . called the hyper velocity asteroid impact vehicle -lrb- __haiv__ -rrb- , their system would be able to launch and reach an __earth-bound__ asteroid within 100 days or so , destroying it before it reached our planet . but the unmanned spacecraft relies on one crucial aspect - tracking and finding an asteroid , before it is too late to stop it impacting earth . scroll down for video . boom ! a danish ngo is planning to develop an __earth-saving__ spacecraft called the hyper velocity asteroid impact vehicle -lrb- __haiv__ -rrb- . in the diagram above , ned stands for nuclear explosive device . the front of the spacecraft would create a small crater , which the nuclear device would then travel in to and explode . the concept was created by the emergency asteroid defence project -lrb- __eadp__ -rrb- , based in denmark . they are seeking to find a way to protect earth from destruction when all other methods have failed . ranging from # 340 million to $ 1 billion -lrb- $ 500 million to $ 1.5 billion -rrb- , the cost of the mission would depend on how large the incoming asteroid that needed to be destroyed was . called the __hypervelocity__ asteroid intercept vehicle , or __haiv__ , the craft would rendezvous with an asteroid in deep space . it consists of a fore body -lrb- a leader spacecraft -rrb- , which would hit the comet and create blast crater . a few seconds later , an __aft__ body -lrb- a follower spacecraft -rrb- carrying nuclear explosives would hit inside the crater - which increases its effectiveness by up to 20 times . once an asteroid had been located , the __haiv__ would be launched on one of several possible rockets , including a delta iv or atlas v . the __haiv__ would then align itself such that it would impact the asteroid , by matching its orbit . the concept works using a ` leader ' and a ` follower ' spacecraft . after the launch , the former would separate and impact the asteroid , forming a crater in its surface . the follower , carrying a nuclear warhead , would then enter the crater and explode , blowing the asteroid to pieces . these pieces would either be deflected from earth , or would be too small to cause any considerable damage . this diagram shows a simulation of the area affected if something the size of halley 's comet , with a diameter of approximately 6.2 miles -lrb- 10km -rrb- , hit the us - a possible global extinction event . this simulation shows the area that would be affected , if a medium asteroid __330ft__ -lrb- 100 metres -rrb- in diameter hit london . the __eadp__ team says there is a significant threat of an asteroid hitting earth . shown is a diagram of how the spacecraft might look , with the nuclear device in the middle . sensors at the front direct the spacecraft towards its target , before it impacts . last year , the __privately-funded__ __b612__ foundation discovered that earth is up to 10 times more likely to be hit than previously thought . while the majority of the impacts occur either high up in the atmosphere , or in __unpopulated__ areas including the atlantic and pacific oceans , the danger was still ever-present . the findings were based on information released from the __nuclear-test-ban__ treaty organisation . this operates a network of sensors that monitor earth around the clock listening for the __infrasound__ signatures of nuclear __detonations__ . but what these sensors found were not nuclear explosions , but rather asteroid impacts on a huge scale . between 2000 and 2013 the network detected 26 explosions on earth ranging in energy from one to 600 __kilotons__ - all caused by asteroid impacts . it relies upon near-earth objects -lrb- __neos__ -rrb- being tracked , so that the threat of one hitting earth can be measured in advance . if a potentially dangerous object is identified , the spacecraft can then be launched and sent on its mission to blow it up , before it has a chance to threaten earth . ` the mission of preparing humanity for a potential asteroid collision is something that should have done a long time ago , ' the team writes on their website . ` we , as an advanced species , have had the basic technology for about half a century . ` events like the one in chelyabinsk , in 2013 , could have been avoided if adequate detection and deflection missions had been developed . ' launching a nuclear device into space may not be as easy as the team thinks , as there are a number of legal issues to do so . however , they say there are no safety issues with launching a nuclear device and , as the __haiv__ will be hitting an asteroid so far into space , ` no nuclear material , radiation or shock wave will reach earth . ' they continued : ` legal complications or not , we do however believe that if , say , a sizeable asteroid is headed towards a city like new york , moscow or beijing , we will as a team be able to gather the global support to get a mandate to act regardless of otherwise existing legal __obstructions__ , if needed in order to save the lives of millions ! ' and on whether it is illegal to send nuclear explosives into space , they said : ` probably not , as long as it is not a weapon . ' last year experts warned that we must do more to track asteroids , as one could cause widespread damage to the planet . most notably , in february 2013 , hundreds of people were injured when a meteor exploded near the city of chelyabinsk in russia - the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century . on the left is a typical journey for the __haiv__ vehicle to intercept an asteroid that could dangerous to earth . in this instance it would take 121 days to stop the asteroid before it hit , illustrated right . in the 1998 movie armageddon , pictured , bruce willis must save earth from an asteroid by flying to the space rock and blowing it up with a bomb . the team is now looking to raise # __675,000__ to # __6.75__ million -lrb- $ 1 million to $ 10 million -rrb- in the next year or so , through crowdfunding sites like kickstarter . by 2018 , they want to build a version of __haiv__ that could destroy an asteroid __165ft__ -lrb- 50 metres -rrb- across . and by the end of the decade , they want to be ready to stop asteroids up to __985ft__ -lrb- 300 metres -rrb- in size - which account for 99.9 per cent of asteroids near earth . they note that their method , using a nuclear device , should be considered a last resort and only used if other methods have failed . such methods could include hitting an asteroid with laser to deflect it , or __rebounding__ solar rays into it to have the same effect . ` however , in extreme cases with less than one year warning time and when all __non-nuclear__ methods fail , we believe the __haiv__ system is the only and most appropriate technique currently available to defend earth , ' the team said in a statement .
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: a danish ngo is planning to develop __earth-saving__ spacecraft . hyper velocity asteroid impact vehicle -lrb- __haiv__ -rrb- will be a ` rapid ' response . it will blow up asteroids that could endanger earth using a nuclear device . but this should only be a last resort when other methods have failed .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  a foetus at 24 weeks . new advice from the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists rules against so-called souvenir scans before 10 weeks . souvenir scans of the unborn baby should not be carried out in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy , say doctors . such keepsake images are shown off by proud __parents-to-be__ , who can buy special wallets and photo frames to mark every stage of pregnancy . but new advice from the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists rules against the growing trend when there is no medical reason for doing an early-stage scan . a new scientific review says ultrasound -- which uses high-frequency sound waves to provide images of the foetus -- could expose it to unknown risks . although there is no evidence of harm , the ` precautionary principle ' should apply , it says . dr christoph lees , reader in obstetrics and fetal medicine at imperial college london and lead author of the paper said the review looked specifically at the first 10 weeks in the womb . normally a scan would be ordered only for a potential problem identified by a clinician and in those circumstances it was perfectly safe , he said . but an increasing number of clinics were offering keepsake images from as early as six weeks , he said . he said : ` ultrasound scanning in the embryonic period is an invaluable resource in several important scenarios where the embryo is at possible risk . ` there are presently no grounds for questioning the safety of diagnostic ultrasound in this context . ` however , ultrasound imaging is increasingly being used without obvious medical justification and we have to be aware of the possibility of subtle long-term adverse effects , particularly in the first weeks of gestation when the embryo is potentially the most vulnerable . ' a pregnant woman looks towards a scan of her unborn baby . an increasing number of clinics are offering keepsake images from as early as six weeks . dr christoph less of imperial college is the lead author of the paper which advises against scans of foetuses during the first 10 weeks in the womb unless they are done for medical reasons . the review was produced by the scientific advisory committee at the __rcog__ to provide doctors with up-to-date information about the issue . the us food and drug administration issued similar advice in december , saying excess ultrasound at any stage in pregnancy should be avoided . dr lees said one of the possible harms might come from the slight heating effect produced by ultrasound which was more easily dissipated by the placenta after 10 weeks of pregnancy . he said the safest period for taking souvenir scans was 20 weeks of pregnancy and beyond . the review highlights the various types of ultrasound , including __b-mode__ -- the most commonly used form of ultrasound in obstetrics -- colour and pulse wave __doppler__ . colour and __pulsed__ wave __doppler__ involve greater average intensity and power __outputs__ than __b-mode__ and are not recommended at all during the first 10 weeks . additionally , there has been a move to perform 3d and 4d ultrasound scans earlier in pregnancy , states the paper . colour and __pulsed__ wave __doppler__ scans have such intensity and power output they are not recommended at all during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy . 4d ultrasound is ` real time ' scanning and involves higher power __outputs__ as the scanning time is longer , typically by several minutes , and should not be the sole purpose of souvenir images or video recordings in early pregnancy . dr __sadaf__ __ghaem-maghami__ , chair of the __rcog__ 's scientific advisory committee , said ` __b-mode__ ultrasound used for clinical reasons from conception to 10 weeks of gestation is safe and the benefits outweigh any theoretical risks . ` we are adopting a precautionary approach and are highlighting the small but possible risks to women so that they can make informed choices . ` we also emphasise that any healthcare professional involved in the use of ultrasound is aware of the safety principles of ultrasound .

' john __hawksworth__ , of pricewaterhousecoopers , said the bank was now ` under no immediate pressure to raise interest rates ' . andrew __haldane__ , the bank 's chief economist , suggested earlier this month that rates could be cut to zero because inflation had ` dropped like a stone ' . low inflation , and even deflation , over a short period can be good for the economy and boost family finances , but a continuous fall in prices is harmful . by alex __brummer__ . the good news . ... and the bad news . bargain prices in shops could be used by employers as an excuse to keep wages low , while workers could delay big purchases in anticipation that costs will fall further -- triggering a downward spiral . yesterday , prime minister david cameron seemed unconcerned by predictions that prices would fall further , saying britain did not ` face the dangerous deflation that some other parts of europe may potentially have a problem with ' . he welcomed the lowest inflation rate in 55 years , saying it was ` good news for family budgets ' , while chancellor george osborne declared that ` prices are frozen ' . estimates released by the office for national statistics show the last time inflation was below 0 per cent was march 1960 -- when harold macmillan was prime minister and the beatles had just formed in liverpool . the last major bout of deflation came during the great depression from 1929 to 1932 . it did not end until britain abandoned the gold standard which the then chancellor winston churchill embraced in 1925 . before that , in the late 19th century the prices of goods , property and shares fell sharply provoking a banking crisis similar in scale and danger to that of 2007 to 2009 . in the early 18th century the value of the pound was fixed against gold and prices were flat and falling until the outbreak of the napoleonic wars . inflation measures the rise and fall of 700 goods and services , from energy prices to clothing . but it is the plummeting cost of petrol , diesel and food that has dragged down the rate to zero . in the past year , there has been a huge fall in the cost of global wholesale oil , causing prices at the pump to tumble by almost 17 per cent . an aggressive supermarket price war has also dragged down the inflation rate , as major stores have been forced to compete with budget rivals such as aldi and lidl . the ons reported that food prices had fallen by more than 3 per cent in february compared with a year earlier . economist vicky redwood , at capital economics , said : ` the uk is now within a whisker of deflation . ` it looks odds-on that inflation will turn negative in march , when the recent cut in gas prices by british gas show up in the inflation figures for the first time . we still think that deflation in the uk will be a `` good '' development , giving households ' incomes a welcome boost and supporting the economic recovery this year . ' rob wood , of __berenberg__ bank , said there was ` a good chance inflation could turn negative next month ' . economist chris williamson , at __markit__ , said : ` rather than being a concern , the drop in inflation is a boon to the economy , providing households with greater spending power at a time when pay growth remains frustratingly weak . ' chief secretary to the treasury danny alexander said that , as pay rises pull ahead of price increases , people had more money in their pockets , helping ` millions of families ' . but shadow treasury minister cathy jamieson said it was external factors that had brought down inflation , rather than the government 's economic policy . she said : ` a few months of falling world oil prices wo n't solve the deep-seated problems in our economy . ' since 2010 , we 've been working through our long-term economic plan to turn britain around . it has n't been easy -- we inherited a country on the brink of bankruptcy -- and i know many of you will have made huge personal sacrifices to support our plan to mend the broken economy and secure a brighter future for this great nation . but it 's been worth it . that plan is working . day by day , month by month , britain 's getting stronger : jobs are on the rise , the deficit 's down , the economy 's growing and wages are going further . and there 's more good news for family budgets , with the inflation figures announced today at a record low of zero per cent . david cameron told mailonline the figures were ` more good news for family budgets ' and proof the government 's economic plan is working . at a time when the world economy is increasingly unstable , these latest figures are a reminder that we 're on the right track -- and that doing things differently would put it all at risk . it 's a reminder that only the conservatives have a plan to build a stronger economy , improve living standards and make families across britain more financially secure . we want to help hardworking people keep more of the money they earn . it is individuals -- not governments -- who know best how to spend their money . that 's why , in government , we 've cut income tax for 26 million by raising the personal allowance to over # 10,000 -- and we will go further in the next parliament . that 's why we 've frozen fuel duty for the longest time in 20 years , saving a typical family # 10 each time they fill up . that 's why we 've secured the biggest ever cash rise in the state pension , which will be # 950 higher than it was in 2010 . that 's why we 're introducing tax-free childcare -- helping out parents with hefty childcare bills . that 's why we provided funding to freeze council tax bills , putting more money in hardworking taxpayers ' pockets . do n't just take me by my word . judge me by my record in government : we 've delivered 2 million quality apprenticeships in the past five years , and will deliver 3 million more in the next five -- giving young people the skills to go out and get a well-paid job . we 're backing business , industry and enterprise -- creating 1,000 jobs a day and driving down unemployment - now at its lowest level since 2008 . we 're getting britain building again , helping young people to own their own home . we 've already announced 200,000 cut-price homes for first-time buyers under 40 . and we will now help first-time buyers save for a deposit . a strong economy is the backbone of a strong nation . and a strong nation is built on people who work hard and want to get on life . mums and dads working round the clock to put food on the table and do the best they can for their children ; grandparents who 've saved hard all their lives to support their loved ones in times of need ; sons and daughters who want to get on with their lives , get a job , get a home , and make something of themselves . a conservative government after may 8 will carry on working through our plan to secure a brighter future for you , your family and for britain . step by step , milestone after milestone . last week it was a record increase in the minimum wage , today it 's the rate of inflation . this government has a long-term plan -- and we 're determined to make it work for you .
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: consumer prices index falls to 0 % , meaning prices did not rise in a year . sharp falls in food and petrol costs helped to ease the pressure on families . david cameron tells mailonline it is ` more good news for family budgets ' wages rising by 1.6 % means workers should see their money go further .

' the study aims to use the same chemicals , called __leachates__ , which the mining industry uses to pull metals out of rock . while some of these __leachates__ have a bad reputation for damaging ecosystems when they leak or spill into the environment , in a controlled setting , they could safely be used to recover metals in treated solid waste . in the treated waste researchers already started to discover metals like platinum , silver and gold observing __microscopic-sized__ metal particles in __biosolids__ using a scanning electron microscope . ` the gold we found was at the level of a minimal mineral deposit ' meaning if that amount were in rock , it might be commercially viable to mine it . dr smith added that ` the economic and technical feasibility of metal recovery from __biosolids__ needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis . ' the study presented at the __249th__ national meeting & __exposition__ of the american chemical society -lrb- __acs__ -rrb- involved collecting samples from small towns in the rocky mountains , rural communities and big cities . for a more comprehensive picture , they plan to combine their information with many years ' worth of existing data collected by the environmental protection agency and other groups at the geological survey .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  horses played a crucial role ferrying supplies to australian troops during world war one and carrier pigeons kept commanders in touch with soldiers fighting on the front lines . but did you know domestic cats and dogs , kangaroos and even glow worms were enlisted by australian troops in their efforts to win the war ? new research has uncovered the extent to which a range of animals helped our troops in amazing historical photographs . of the 130,000 horses sent to battle in wwi only one horse , named sandy , made it back to australian shores . ben mercer , content director at genealogy organisation __ancestry.com__ , said a renewed interest australia 's __war-time__ history prompted him to start researching the role of animals in the great war , which led him to the discovery of a rich photographic history . mr mercer said horses played a vital role in wwi with around 130,000 sent overseas to support australia 's war effort . originally intended to play a cavalry role , it was soon realised the horses were not suited to the terrain and the men would have a better chance fighting on foot . ` the horses went from being __cavalry-based__ to assisting with transport and communication . they became very important to moving supplies and men from behind the lines to the battlefield . ' horses usually drink about 30 litres of water a day but when resources were stretched at the height of the the animals often went 60 hours without __life-sustaining__ fluids while carrying over 130 kilograms each of equipment , food , water and supplies . at war 's end , just one horse , named sandy , made it back to australian shores . the rest were put down or handed off to british units and used in palestine . horses usually drink about 30 litres of water a day but in the height of the war when resources were stretched , horses often went 60 hours without water carrying over 130 kilograms of equipment , food , water and supplies . camels were also the perfect candidate for long haul trips where it was required to pull heavy loads across long distances with very little food and water . with a lack of water in the field camels were prime candidates for long haul trips where it was required to pull wounded men and heavy loads across long distances as they are genetically equipped to survive on little food and water . man 's best friend also found his way on to the battlefield , not only as a __war-time__ companion , but to to carry important messages and sniff out explosives or injured soldiers . their superior strength , agility , territorial nature and __trainability__ made them the perfect candidate for their jobs on the field . dogs strength , agility , territorial nature and __trainability__ gave them the edge on the battle field . ` very often the phone lines on the western front would be destroyed in artillery __barrages__ . men who acted as runners would be shot so dogs were used when all else failed to carry those really important messages . ' dogs became such an important part of life on the battle field that soldiers made specialised gas masks to ensure the pooches were n't affected by deadly gas released on the field . another species also played a vital role in battlefield communications , and was the first animal to be awarded a medal of honour : the humble pigeon . carrier pigeons were the first animal awarded a medal for their contribution to the war . carrier pigeons were used by troops to send important logistical information to their commanders when phone lines were damaged or it was difficult to send a runner . they were silent , quick and were n't affected by the gas that hung over combat zones at ground level . ` men would go forward during battle carrying cages of pigeons so they could talk to their commanders if all else failed , ' mr mercer told daily mail australia . carrier pigeons were used by troops to send ` important logistical information ' back to their commanders when the phone lines were damaged or it was difficult to send a runner . carrier pigeons were the first to be awarded the animal equivalent of a victoria cross - the __dickin__ medal . it was presented after an animal displayed gallant devotion to serving the men and women on the field . mr mercer said this only testifies to the importance of the messages the pigeons carried . the medal was presented to 32 pigeons , 29 dogs , three horses and one cat . kangaroos were taken to hospitals to become companions for injured soldiers and played an important role in reminding __soliers__ of home . one of australia 's most iconic animals also made it across the globe to support our injured soldiers . kangaroos were taken to hospitals deep in the war zone to raise the morale of wounded soldiers . ` they would take care of them , pat them and feel better about the difficult time they were facing . ` i think it also reminded the men of australia , of home , ' he added . donkeys stamina in the heat and cold made them the perfect candidate to carry soldiers and equipment . the story of simpson and his donkey became a part of the anzac legend but there were many other donkeys and mules who 's stamina in the cold and heat contributed to their ability to perform while transporting soldiers and equipment throughout wwi . ` they were also used to tow field ambulances and were very important in battles like gallipoli where it was difficult to move men and supplies from the front line . ' ` in the trenches of the western front there were serious problems with rats . as you could imagine wherever you have food , and unfortunately decaying bodies , there were rats and it was the cat 's job to keep them at bay ' mr mercer said , like in any farming household , cats were also kept on boats and in trenches to take care of rodent problems . glow worms provided the soldiers with light , even in the darkest hour . ` in the trenches of the western front there were serious problems with rats . as you could imagine wherever you have food , and unfortunately decaying bodies , there were rats and it was the cat 's job to keep them at bay . ' mr mercer said australians were known for their innovation in the trenches . even in the darkest of hours they found an interesting way to use glow worms that would bring light to the battlefield . ` they adapted very quickly to very difficult situations and when they were in action , being asked to perform roles in the dark , they used glow worms to give themselves a bit of light where they needed it . ' after collecting the worms , soldiers would place them into jars so they were able to examine maps or intelligence reports , even read letters from home . cramming ten glow worms into a jar could reportedly provide as much light as a modern day roadway light and did n't require the same kind of back up or fuel that other lights did . mr mercer said he 's seen a strong interest from australians who want to get a better idea of who they are and how their family history fits into the ` australian story ' . __ancestry.com__ are now opening 12 million wwi records available online for all australians to discover more about their wwi family history .
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: simpson 's donkey at gallipoli was not the only animal hero that helped australian troops during the __conflit__ . a whole range of animals were used on the battlefields and made a significant contribution . horses and donkeys carried wounded soldiers or equipment , while cats played a crucial __rat-catcher__ role . pigeons carried vital messages from the __frontlines__ to commanders when lines were cut and runners were n't viable . innovative soldiers would collect glow worms and put them in jars to use them as lights on the field . even kangaroos shipped from home became companions for soldiers recuperating from their wounds .

to __13-foot__ -lrb- 2 - to 4 meter -rrb- wide boulder . the mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation orion multi-purpose crew vehicle . after the orion and the asteroid are attached , the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object . once the orion docks with the __remote-operated__ asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows . after the mission is complete , orion returns to earth on the same path it journeyed out on , loops around the moon included , and splashes down in an ocean - likely the pacific - 10 days later . the mission is seen as an important step towards eventually sending humans to mars and returning them safely . ` i 'm going to have multiple targets ... we can assess which . one we want to go after and i then have three - to five tries to . get it , or i can move on to a different one , ' lightfoot said . the captured boulder , which would remain attached to the . probe , would then be nudged into an orbit circling high around . the moon , a maneuver expected to take about six years . the probe would include a docking ring so a nasa orion . spaceship , carrying two astronauts , could reach the asteroid , a . mission targeted for around 2025 . nasa 's ultimate goal is to send humans to mars , and they say the asteroid redirect mission -lrb- arm -rrb- will be an important stepping stone towards getting there . a number of new spaceflight capabilities will be tested in the 2020s as part of the mission , which will involve __redirecting__ an asteroid to orbit the moon and sending humans to explore it . astronauts aboard nasa 's orion spacecraft , launched from the upcoming space launch system -lrb- sls -rrb- rocket , will then explore the asteroid in the __mid-2020s__ at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon . nasa plans to launch an arm robotic spacecraft to rendezvous with , capture and redirect an asteroid by the end of this decade . the spacecraft will redirect it to a stable orbit around the moon called a ` distant __retrograde__ orbit ' - one that orbits the moon very widely , coming quite close before extending out much further away . astronauts aboard nasa 's orion spacecraft , launched from the upcoming space launch system -lrb- sls -rrb- rocket , will then explore the asteroid in the __mid-2020s__ at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon . within the papers , authors explain the current work taking place across the country to examine options for these robotic and crewed missions . this includes advanced solar electric propulsion -lrb- sep -rrb- - one of the critical technologies needed to send larger payloads into deep space and to the mars system . sep - or ion propulsion - creates thrust powered by solar arrays , which transforms sunlight into electromagnetic fields that accelerate and expel charged atoms -lrb- ions -rrb- . this is a very efficient way to power a spacecraft and significantly cuts down on the amount of fuel a spacecraft needs to carry , which can be heavy and expensive to launch from earth . an asteroid named __itokawa__ photographed by the __hayabusa__ probe . the agency plans to announce the specific asteroid selected for the mission no earlier than 2019 , approximately a year before launching the robotic spacecraft . before an asteroid is considered a valid candidate for the mission , scientists must first determine its characteristics , in addition to size , such as rotation , shape and precise orbit . nasa has identified three valid candidates for the mission so far : __itokawa__ , __bennu__ and 2008 __ev5__ . the agency expects to identify one or two additional candidates each year leading up to the mission . returning asteroid samples will help nasa develop tools and techniques for future space exploration . this early experience with raw materials could also help advance our ability to make use of natural resources in space . rocky bodies like asteroids and our moon could hold enough oxygen and hydrogen to create breathable air , drinkable water or even components for rocket fuel . there also is growing interest in the commercial space industry to potentially mine asteroids for resources in the future . with this in mind some of the papers outline ways in which arm might benefit future commercial activities at asteroids - namely collecting resources for use back on earth or in space . current studies at nasa detailed in the papers are examining ways sep will be used to power the arm robotic mission . nasa was also working on a mission concept that would fully __enclose__ a large asteroid using an inflatable system and the other would capture a smaller boulder from of a much larger asteroid using robotic arms . the arm crewed mission , in which astronauts will explore the redirected asteroid around the moon , provides unique opportunities to test human spaceflight capabilities as well . the papers detail current work underway at nasa to upgrade spacesuits in preparation for the first spacewalks in deep space since the 1960s and farther from earth than ever before . concepts for new hardware to dock the crewed and __uncrewed__ spacecraft together are also in development . this will allow the crew aboard orion to attach to the arm robotic spacecraft and study the asteroid . this could be later used to connect orion with a deep space habitat or ` stepping stone ' on its way to mars , or even station cargo and fuel depots in strategic places such as lunar orbit . astronauts returning home with samples from mars will hold a treasure trove of research scientists will study to unlock new knowledge about mars and the solar system 's history . various techniques for deflecting a potentially hazardous asteroid could be tested on arm to enable planetary defense capabilities . these techniques include ion beam deflection , enhanced gravity tractor , and kinetic __impactors__ . in ion beam deflection , the plumes from the thrusters would be directed towards the asteroid to gently push on its surface over a wide area . a __thruster__ firing in the opposite direction would be needed to keep the spacecraft at a constant distance from the asteroid . the ion beam deflection approach is independent of the size of the asteroid , and it could be demonstrated on either mission option . in the enhanced gravity tractor approach , the spacecraft would first pick up a boulder from the asteroid 's surface as in mission option b . the spacecraft with the collected boulder would then orbit in a circular halo around the asteroid 's velocity __vector__ . the mass of the boulder coupled with the mass of the spacecraft would increase the gravitational attraction between the spacecraft and the asteroid . by flying the spacecraft in close formation with the asteroid for several months the very small gravitational forces would produce a measurable change in the asteroid 's trajectory . a kinetic __impactor__ could also be launched as a secondary payload with the spacecraft or on a separate launch vehicle , and it would collide with the target asteroid at high velocity while the spacecraft observed the impact . as well as this , returning asteroid samples will help nasa develop tools and techniques for future space exploration . this early experience with raw materials could also help advance our ability to make use of natural resources in space . rocky bodies like asteroids and our moon could hold enough oxygen and hydrogen to create breathable air , drinkable water or even components for rocket fuel . there also is growing interest in the commercial space industry to potentially mine asteroids for resources in the future . with this in mind some of the papers outline ways in which arm might benefit future commercial activities at asteroids -

' the appeals were ultimately rejected . ` cecil clayton had - literally - a hole in his head , ' said elizabeth unger carlyle , one of his attorneys , following his death on tuesday night . ` executing him without a hearing to determine his competency violated the constitution , missouri law , and basic human dignity ... the world will not be a safer place because mr. clayton has been executed . ' but the victim 's family were in support of his killer being put to death . missing : a brain scan shared by his lawyers show a significant section of his brain is missing . at a press briefing on tuesday evening , james __castetter__ thanked authorities for convicting clayton for the ` senseless murder ' of his brother , chris __castetter__ . ` we know this execution is n't going to bring chris back , ' he said . ` but it destroys an evil person that would otherwise be walking this earth . ` there is no doubt in my mind that cecil knew what he had done ... the great state of missouri did not kill an innocent man . cecil clayton 's actions is what put him to death . ' clayton was convicted of gunning down christopher __castetter__ , a sheriff 's deputy in rural southwest missouri 's barry county . __castetter__ was 29 and a father-of-three when he went to a home near __cassville__ on thanksgiving eve 1996 to check on a suspicious vehicle report . authorities said clayton shot __castetter__ once in the forehead while the deputy was in his car , which was found against a tree , its engine racing and wheels spinning . clayton 's brother had testified that the __sawmill__ accident led to clayton 's breakup from his wife , alcohol abuse and violent outbursts . the lethal injection , clayton 's attorneys said , was ` sure or very likely to cause excruciating or tortuous pain and needless suffering ' in light of his dementia . ` if missouri proceeds with its scheduled execution of mr. clayton , it will be conducting an unregulated experiment on a human subject , as there are no studies that support -lrb- the prison system 's -rrb- use of missouri 's lethal injection protocol on an individual suffering from severe brain damage , ' the appeals on clayton 's behalf argued . killed : barry county sheriff 's deputy christopher __castetter__ , pictured left , was shot dead by clayton , pictured right in an old mug shot , as he responded to a call about a suspicious vehicle in 1996 . at the weekend , when the missouri supreme court issued its decision , three of the seven judges agreed that clayton was entitled to a competency hearing . mental health professionals who examined him agreed that he was mentally impaired and had mental health issues , including dementia . his most recent iq test had found him to have an iq of just 71 , which is 29 points below average . ` he is not simply incompetent legally ; he would be unable to care for himself or manage basic __self-care__ , were he not in a structured environment that takes care of him , ' according to a doctor who examined him , the kansas city star reported . ` he can shower , groom , eat , walk ; it is his comprehension , judgment , memory , limited intelligence and social deficits that plague him . ' in missouri , the director of the department of corrections is the only one with the authority to order a competency hearing , and last year , he called on a doctor to examine clayton . dr. james reynolds of the missouri department of mental health had concluded that clayton was mentally ill , but could not be certain that he did n't understand his death sentence . but clayton 's lawyers said , while he had conversations in which he understood he was about to be executed , he would later forget that conversation ever happened . his family also called for a fair hearing on the issue . execution : he was put to death at the state prison in __bonne__ terre , pictured , on tuesday night . death : his family and lawyers had argued that he was __child-like__ and did not understand the significance of his death penalty . they had called for his execution at __bonne__ terre -lrb- pictured -rrb- to be stopped . ` he is brain-damaged , and talking with him is like talking to a child , ' clayton 's daughter , jena clayton , said during his clemency petition , the kansas city star reported .

' at the execution , department of corrections director george a. lombardi read a statement from governor jay nixon , in which he praised the work of __castetter__ . ` our state is safer because there are brave officers , like deputy __castetter__ , who are willing to sacrifice their own safety for that of others , ' he said . ` as the sentence of his murderer was carried out this evening , i ask __missourians__ tonight to honor deputy __castetter__ , who gave his life in service to our state , and to remember him and his family in their thoughts and prayers .
