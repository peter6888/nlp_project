ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- on the 6th of april 1996 , san jose clash and dc united strode out in front of __31,683__ expectant fans at the spartan stadium in san jose , california . the historic occasion was the first ever major league soccer match -- a brave new dawn for the world 's favorite sport in a land its charms had yet to conquer . __summarizing__ the action for espn , commentator ty __keough__ eagerly described the momentous `` birth of a new era for american soccer . '' looking back at footage from that balmy evening now it 's hard not to feel a certain nostalgia . baggy shirts , questionable hairstyles and strange rule adaptations to make games more exciting were all part of the formative mls experience . countdown clocks were employed to provide drama at the end of each half . even more bizarrely , tied games were settled by shootouts that saw attacking players run with the ball from __35-yards__ out before attempting to beat the opposing goalkeeper . as the mls prepares to mark the beginning of its 20th season , it 's hard to comprehend just how much the league has progressed in the intervening period . long gone is the desire to tamper with the rules of the game for a start . attendances are higher than ever before while the number of teams involved has doubled from 10 in the 1996 campaign to 20 in 2015 . a further four are set to be added by 2020 . on top of this , the new season is the first of a new domestic tv and media rights deal with fox , espn and univision worth $ 700 million over eight years . this figure may pale beside the $ 5.1 billion recently paid by uk broadcasters for the english premier league , the richest football league in the world , but it represents a tripling in value of the previous mls deal . according to phil __rawlins__ , __co-primary__ owner and president of the new mls franchise , orlando city soccer club , `` the industry and the game itself has moved on dramatically '' in the u.s. . he believes what would equal 50 years growth in most other industries has been experienced in the first two decades of the mls . __rawlins__ ' club is a prime example of this rapid transformation . he describes players being pushed out of changing facilities because of a schedule clash with a yoga class not so long ago . this weekend 60,000 fans are expected to witness orlando city 's opening weekend fixture against new york city , another new club making their mls bow . world cup winners kaka and david villa will turn out for orlando and new york city respectively . `` we 're just on the crest of the wave at the moment , '' __rawlins__ said of football 's american progress . `` can it be the number two , number three sport in this country ? yes , i think it can . and it can be in a short space of time . '' these positive assertions are backed by the huge interest u.s. fans showed in last year 's world cup in brazil . team usa 's group stage clash with portugal attracted 25 million viewers , according to figures from tv ratings firm , nielsen . that 's considerably more than the 15 million baseball 's 2013 world series averaged on fox or the similar audience that tuned into the 2014 nba finals on abc . anyone who saw 20,000 __pumped-up__ young fans pack out chicago 's grant park to cheer on their country via big screens , meanwhile , would find it hard to argue against soccer in the u.s. now being anything other than a big deal . reaching this promising stage , however , has been anything but a smooth ride . the mls was reported to have lost as much as $ 250 million in its first five years while average attendances initially dwindled after the inaugural season . three teams -- miami fusion , tampa bay mutiny -lrb- both in 2001 -rrb- and chivas usa -lrb- 2014 -rrb- -- were disbanded along the way due to a mixture of lack of fan interest and ownership troubles . a report by forbes at the end of 2013 , meanwhile , claimed that only 10 out of 19 mls teams were profitable . and as recently as this week , mls players looked like they could be going on strike over wages and the right of players to become free agents when their contracts end . then there 's the way the league develops , attracts and trades players . a salary cap restricts the amount teams can spend on playing squads . each side , however , has a number of spaces that can be allocated to `` off budget '' signings which are not included within the cap . this includes promising generation adidas players who enter the mls through the draft systems before completing their college education . homegrown players from club 's development academies are also exempt as are a maximum of three designated players -lrb- dps -rrb- , usually stellar international names whose wages and transfer fees will be covered by club owners or sponsors . one of the main criticisms of the mls and its complex player acquisition __rulebook__ is that while it does entice prominent stars of the game like david beckham , freddie ljungberg and thierry henry to appear in the mls , it only does so when their careers are on a downward trajectory . why would an exceptional player want to move to a league that can only attract a handful of top talents at any one time , after all ? and __herein__ lies one of the leagues biggest challenges in attracting and keeping the talented players fans want to see . although the likes of the salary cap encourages fiscal __probity__ , it means mls teams are restricted by rules clubs in other markets are not . head coach of sporting kansas , peter __vermes__ , highlighted these difficulties in comments carried by the kansas city star newspaper last year . `` we 're in a place where at times you ca n't compete with foreign clubs because of the kind of dynamics they have in regards to finances . we have a salary cap . they do n't , '' __vermes__ said . according to paulo teixeira , a football agent who has worked to bring in and sell players from the league in recent years , current philosophies with regards __player-trading__ may be have to be tweaked to help the mls grow yet further . he describes the importance of placing an emphasis on attracting younger players with european passports . such talented individuals will have a __sell-on__ value that can be recouped by the league and their clubs if they move on from the mls to the biggest and wealthiest leagues across the atlantic . theoretically , at least , this money can then be reinvested in the league , player development and attracting yet more promising players to the mls . this in turn will raise the standard further . an early example of this strategy can perhaps be found in the transfer of __oriol__ __rossell__ , a spanish midfielder who moved from sporting kansas to sporting lisbon last year in a deal brokered by teixeira . __rossell__ arrived on a free transfer aged 20 after being released by fc barcelona in 2012 . he excelled at kansas , winning the mls cup before being sold to the portuguese giants at a profit in june 2014 . teixeira is quick to make clear such plans would need good scouting systems to truly flourish . it could also be achieved by signing dps closer to the peak stage of their career , he added . this last point is something that appears be happening already . `` before they used to have a lot of big names who could no longer run in europe , '' teixeira said . '' -lrb- but -rrb- villa is not an old guy , -lrb- frank -rrb- lampard is still going strong '' and both could still offer something to teams in europe , he said by way of example of new york city 's first dp signings . nevertheless , he continued , the signing of more young players with big potential `` is probably something we 'll see more of . '' whether teixeira is correct will become apparent in the months and years ahead . either way , that brave new mls dawn that broke over san jose back in 1996 has turned into a bright morning . cnn 's don riddell contributed to this story .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- french striker bafetimbi gomis , who has a history of fainting , said he is now `` feeling well '' after collapsing during swansea 's 3-2 loss at tottenham in the premier league on wednesday . the worrying incident occurred in the first half at white hart lane -- after tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment . the guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask . play was temporarily stopped before resuming . as the match progressed , swansea tweeted that gomis was `` fine , '' with manager garry monk using the same word to describe gomis ' condition . gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution , swansea said on its website . `` i wanted to reassure you concerning my health , '' gomis told the website . `` it actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous , and i am feeling well now . `` i have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father 's health , which requires me to go back and forth from france . `` i was disappointed that i could n't help my team tonight , but now everything is back in order . i also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages . '' gomis had similar fainting spells in france , which prompted the president of his former club , jean-michel __aulas__ of lyon , to tell french television in 2009 : `` we ca n't not be worried , it scares you each time . '' swansea ran tests on gomis , said monk , prior to signing him on a free transfer last july . `` he just has a little bit of low blood pressure which causes you a little bit of problems , '' monk said in a televised interview on sky . `` it 's been part of his life . we were well aware of that when we signed him . he 's done all the hospital checks and all the medical checks you can possibly do and it 's just part of his life . `` it 's no problems whatsoever . it 's not as serious as it looks . '' gomis has scored two league goals for swansea this season , mostly in a backup role . he became the welsh side 's top striker when wilfried bony signed with manchester city in january . almost exactly three years ago at white hart lane , then bolton midfielder fabrice muamba collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest . he was near death , according to bolton , but survived after being treated at the london chest hospital . he subsequently retired . other footballers , including cameroon international __marc-vivien__ foe in 2003 and spanish international antonio __puerta__ in 2007 , did n't survive after collapsing on the pitch .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- my vote for father of the year goes to curt schilling . the former major league baseball pitcher recently fired off a series of __fastballs__ and mowed down a group of twitter trolls who made the mistake of tweeting vulgar and __sexually-explicit__ comments about schilling 's teenage daughter . the drama started , innocently enough , on february 25 , when schilling played the role of a proud father . he sent a tweet congratulating his daughter , gabby , on being accepted to __salve__ regina university , where she 'll play softball . it read : `` congrats to gabby schilling who will pitch for the __salve__ regina seahawks next year !! -- curt schilling -lrb- __@gehrig38__ -rrb- '' almost immediately , responses came in from young men , complete strangers who apparently followed schilling on twitter . the tweets quickly went from immature , to creepy , to repugnant . threats of rape were common . the tweets were deleted , and the accounts were closed after this story went viral . but not before schilling captured some of the images and posted them on his blog . what was said about 17-year-old gabby schilling was n't just obnoxious . it was vile and obscene . what was said was n't just mean and ugly . it was threatening and scary . as a parent , it 's the kind of thing that makes you rethink your opposition to public __caning__ as a logical punishment for such transgressions . these misogynistic cowards may have thought they could hide in the darkness of anonymity , the sort that many have come to expect from social media sites , where you feel free to be a despicable human being because , you think , no one will ever find out who you really are and hold you accountable for your words . if so , they thought wrong . they could n't hide . they were found out , and they got the throttling they so richly deserved . thanks to dad . according to schilling , who made it his mission to track down these __cretins__ and make sure those they associate with know who they really are , two people have already paid a price due to their tweets . one was a student disc jockey at a community college in new jersey , who was suspended , and the other was a part-time ticket seller for the new york yankees , who was fired . concerned that this is an example of exactly the kind of cyberbullying that leads some teenagers to commit suicide , schilling is also thinking about taking legal action against some of the other people involved . bravo for him . i 'm sure that , all across america , dads with daughters -- after reading some of the horrible things that were said about this young girl -- are __marveling__ at schilling 's self-control . i have two daughters of my own , and he 's a better man than me . if ever there was a case where __profanity-spewing__ __malcontents__ deserved to have their mouths washed out with soap , this is it . so what additional insights can we draw , and what larger lessons can we learn , from this unexpected but predictable collision of old-fashioned parenthood and __newfangled__ media ? there are a few . the first is about accountability , the very thing that the young men who posted these hurtful messages were trying to avoid . but schilling would n't let them . at their best , social media sites like twitter , facebook , instagram and others allow the sharing the information and the building of a sense of community . at their worst , they become digital __sandboxes__ and locker rooms where people think have a license to __misbehave__ without having to worry about consequences . we need to applaud efforts like this that promote greater online accountability . there 's also something to be said about protective parents , and how essential they are to a working society . we should still be concerned about those __overprotective__ parents who hover like helicopters from little league to job interviews . we should n't __bubblewrap__ our kids , and keep them from playing outdoors , and then sit around wondering why they 're soft , timid , and __risk-averse__ . but protective parents -- the kind who shield their kids from real danger -- never go out of style . a parent 's top job is to protect his children . schilling did his job . finally , it 's worth reminding everyone that freedom of expression does not mean freedom from rules , standards , and expectations that should guide your behavior . there are things you do n't say . there are boundaries , ways that we expect you to behave so you do n't terrorize other people or bring shame upon yourself , your friends , and your family . if you do n't have social skills , you do n't belong on social media . the tweets make you wince . but in this story , you 'll still find plenty to smile about . this whole drama unfolded because schilling was proud of his daughter . now , given how he reacted , we all have reason to be proud of him .

'' cnn can not verify the authenticity of the page . but the power that multiplied broussard 's gift was data processing of genetic profiles from __donor-recipient__ pairs . it works on a simple swapping principle but takes it to a much higher level , according to california pacific medical center in san francisco . so high , that it is taking five surgeons , a __covey__ of physician assistants , nurses and __anesthesiologists__ , and more than 40 support staff to perform surgeries on 12 people . they are extracting six kidneys from donors and implanting them into six recipients . `` the ages of the donors and recipients range from 26 to 70 and include three parent and child pairs , one sibling pair and one brother and sister-in-law pair , '' the medical center said in a statement . the chain of surgeries is to be wrapped up friday . in late march , the medical center is planning to hold a reception for all 12 patients . here 's how the super swap works , according to california pacific medical center . say , your brother needs a kidney to save his life , or at least get off of dialysis , and you 're willing to give him one of yours . but then it turns out that your kidney is not a match for him , and it 's certain his body would reject it . your brother can then get on a years-long waiting list for a kidney coming from an organ donor who died . maybe that will work out -- or not , and time could run out for him . alternatively , you and your brother could look for another __recipient-living__ donor couple like yourselves -- say , two more siblings , where the donor 's kidney is n't suited for his sister , the recipient . but maybe your kidney is a match for his sister , and his kidney is a match for your brother . so , you 'd do a swap . that 's called a paired donation . it 's a bit of a surgical square dance , where four people cross over partners temporarily and everybody goes home smiling . but instead of a square dance , broussard 's generous move set off a chain reaction , like dominoes falling . her kidney , which was removed thursday , went to a recipient , who was paired with a donor . that donor 's kidney went to the next recipient , who was also paired with a donor , and so on . on friday , the last donor will give a kidney to someone who has been __biding__ time on one of those deceased donor lists to complete the chain . such __long-chain__ __transplanting__ is rare . it 's been done before , california pacific medical center said in a statement , but matching up the people in the chain has been laborious and taken a long time . that changed when a computer programmer named david jacobs received a kidney transplant . he had been waiting on a deceased donor list , when a live donor came along -- someone nice enough to give away a kidney to a stranger . jacobs paid it forward with his programming skills , creating __matchgrid__ , a program that genetically matches up donor pairs or chains quickly . `` when we did a __five-way__ swap a few years ago , which was one of the largest , it took about three to four months . we did this in about three weeks , '' jacobs said . but this chain would n't have worked so quickly without broussard 's generosity -- or may not have worked at all . `` the significance of the altruistic donor is that it opens up possibilities for pairing compatible donors and recipients , '' said dr. steven __katznelson__ . `` where there had been only three or four options , with the inclusion of the altruistic donor , we had 140 options to consider for matching donors and recipients .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- an officer , responding to reports of a suspicious person , shot and killed an unarmed man who was running around in a metro atlanta apartment complex naked . the officer fired two shots when the man charged at him , said cedric alexander , the public safety director of dekalb county . but given that the man was not carrying a weapon , the police department immediately turned over the case to the georgia bureau of investigations for an independent probe . `` what i have requested here -lsb- is -rsb- a result of what 's going on currently across this country as it relates to police shootings , '' alexander told reporters . the officer was white ; the deceased man was african-american , alexander said . the incident took place monday afternoon at an apartment complex in __chamblee__ , a suburb of atlanta . someone called 911 to report a man `` acting deranged , knocking on doors and crawling around naked , '' alexander said . when the officer arrived , the man charged at him , alexander said . `` the officer called him to stop while stepping backward , drew his weapon and fired two shots , '' he said . the man , struck twice in the upper body , died . police later learned he was a resident at the complex . `` i can only reasonably assume that if he was running around the apartment complex naked , i believe we can make the assumption there may have been some mental health experience that he might have been having , '' alexander said . dekalb county police officers undergo some degree of training on how to deal with the mentally ill . but this , and other incidents , highlight the need for more , the public safety director said . `` that 's becoming more and more apparent , '' alexander said . `` we have already , as many departments have begun to do , look at how to expand our mental health training when we find it certainly necessary to do so . because it appears that we 're seeing more and more of these cases across the country in which police are engaging with those who appear to be in distress . '' police did not release the officer 's name , but said the seven-year veteran was placed on administrative leave . during the incident , the officer had access to his stun gun and pepper spray , alexander said . why he chose to draw his weapon will come out during the investigation . `` i think in all fairness we need to wait and see what the outcome of the investigation is because i ca n't tell you , beyond what i have told you so far , what kind of measures that officer may have taken , '' he said . as fatal police shootings come under increased scrutiny in the current climate , police departments also appear to be more forthcoming in proactively releasing information for transparency 's sake . such is the case in madison , wisconsin , where madison police chief mike __koval__ has been out front and outspoken about the shooting death of 19-year-old tony robinson at the hands of an officer . and it seems to be the case in this dekalb county incident . `` if you look at the state in this country and the things we 're going through right now across this country with __police-involved__ shooting , certainly it 's a concern to many americans . and there has certainly been recommendations that have been made in regards to moving towards more independent type of investigations , '' he said .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- nascar announced wednesday that it has lifted its suspension of driver kurt busch , making him eligible to return to the sport immediately -- albeit `` under indefinite probation . '' busch was suspended after a delaware civil court found that he probably committed domestic violence against his former girlfriend , patricia driscoll . she accused the standout driver of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head against a wall in his motor home at delaware 's dover international speedway in september . twice , the nascar 2004 cup champion appealed his indefinite suspension and lost both times . that meant he missed the season-opening daytona 500 as well as two subsequent sprint cup races . but he should be able to compete through the fall , and nascar says that it will waive its requirement for him to compete in all championship events . the case against busch took a significant turn last week , when the delaware department of justice announced that charges would not be filed against him . `` as i have said from the beginning , i did not commit domestic abuse , '' busch said then . `` i look forward to being back in racing as soon as possible and moving on with my life . '' a kent county , delaware , family court commissioner ruled in february that busch must stay away from driscoll for a year . nascar officials decided to lift busch 's suspension because he complied with the requirements of the racing circuit 's reinstatement program , completed behavioral assessments and got the ok from a behavioral health care expert to race again . he 's not totally out of the woods . in a news release , nascar said busch must `` undergo additional steps to address the behavior for which he was penalized . '' steve o'donnell , nascar executive vice president and chief racing development officer , said the lack of charges against busch expedited his return . `` we have made it very clear to kurt busch our expectations for him moving forward , which includes participation in a treatment program and full compliance with all judicial requirements as a result of his __off-track__ behavior , '' o'donnell said . cnn 's jill martin contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- when i was a child , a pale specter used to call our house most evenings , eager to chat with my doctor father about her myriad medical concerns . we called her the `` white bread lady , '' a moniker she earned for one particularly inane call in which she panicked to my father after consuming white bread . she was n't breaking out in hives or having any adverse effects to the bread . no , she was just concerned that some future illness could befall her given that one particular dietary decision . although we all laughed at the time , it was with a bit of __shifty-eyed__ shame . because most of us -lrb- including if not particularly the illustrious __ehrlich__ family -rrb- have lurking within us our very own `` white bread lady , '' ready to convince us that each cough , __sniffle__ and __less-than-nutritious__ meal might be a detriment to our health . and , naturally , that white bread lady looms even larger when we can type our worries into a search bar and unlock a bevy of potentially distressing information . __yup__ , so __quoth__ google , we all have cancer . according to the pew research center , 80 % of internet users have looked up health information online . while that practice can be beneficial in some respects , the abundance of -lrb- __variably__ valid -rrb- information online can turn us into __e-hypochondriacs__ . -lrb- or , worse , can lead us to neglect getting the care we need . -rrb- . read on for five mistakes -- courtesy of a selection of health care professionals -- that people make when diagnosing themselves online . searching blind . your eye is twitching like an overly caffeinated college student sitting behind a pretty girl in lecture hall , twirling his pencil and hoping to catch a whiff of her lovely shining hair . you type `` eye twitch '' into google and come up with a really rad website that explains that this newfound spasm is actually an indication that your third eye is fixing to open , revealing to you wonders untold . you are the chosen one . too bad that this trove of `` medical information '' is actually some dude 's __fan-fiction__ site . sure , the above is an extreme example , but , as dr. kevin __pho__ of __kevinmd.com__ pointed out , `` there 's a lot of bad information on the web and information that can be dangerous . '' especially if you 're not considering who put up that information in the first place . __pho__ urges users to favor web addresses ending in . org and . __edu__ when looking for reputable health-care info , and to check who is funding the collection of that information . `` there 's so much information from organizations trying to sell products or push their agenda on the web , '' he said . he suggests turning to sites like mayo clinic as well as __troves__ of information curated by doctors -lrb- like __pho__ 's own website -rrb- when trolling the web for info . and , of course , if a site mentions trolls and third eyes , one should definitely press on . flailing in forums . if there 's one thing people like to do online , it 's talk about their problems -- especially mundane things like coughs and headaches and their babies ' various and __sundry__ discharges . that 's all well and good ; sharing experiences with others is enriching ! unless the people you 're sharing with are idiots . `` you can easily fall into that rabbit hole and find some forum that really is n't relevant but maybe sounds kind of close , '' warned craig __monsen__ , co-founder of __symptom-checker__ app __symcat__ . on the other hand , `` sometimes you 'll stumble on exactly the right forum where someone has your same exact problem , and their solution does help . '' `` health care forums are definitely another tool that individuals can use in order to __crowdsource__ a diagnosis based on their symptoms , '' added dr. natasha __burgert__ of kc kids doc . `` i think that these can be a really powerful tool not only for discussing potential diagnosis or symptom relief but also finding a forum of individuals in which you can discuss emotional and psychological parts of an illness and develop a wonderful online support community . '' the trick is to be wary about the issues being discussed in forums and how __germane__ they are to you . and , you know , if people start talking about homemade remedies fashioned from bleach , maybe click off and see a doc . getting emotional . you know that game `` 6 degrees of kevin bacon '' ? there should seriously be a version of that called `` 6 degrees of cancer '' -- as in , when looking up your symptoms online , how long does it take to __deduce__ that you have a life-threatening disease instead of , say , a simple cold ? according to __burgert__ , the root of this whole `` worst-case scenario '' thing is getting too emotional . `` for most intents and purposes , when you 're looking for online health information , it 's about yourself or a family member , '' she said . `` when you 're looking through that lens , it 's very hard to keep emotional distance . so you can read about a diagnosis that either makes you very scared or calms your fears -- and that 's the path you 'll continue down , whether it 's correct or not . '' __burgert__ suggested using online symptom checkers simply to `` understand possible diagnoses , find some initial steps for relieving the symptoms and determine if this is something that needs further evaluation or that can be managed at home . '' __symcat__ and mayo clinic 's symptom checker let you type in what you 're experiencing and unearth a spectrum of diagnoses and suggestions for when to seek a doctor 's aid . your doctor 's website might also have such a tool . __voila__ , you just increased your separation from cancer by at least a couple of degrees . keeping mum around __mds__ . `` i think , traditionally , many physicians are a little apprehensive when that stereotypical patient comes to their office with big stacks of __printouts__ from the internet , '' __pho__ said . `` but i think more and more doctors are accepting it . personally , i think that transparency of information is helpful in a way . '' translation : help your doctor help you . if you 're worried about a particular medical situation and did some research to help narrow down what 's ailing you , share that info with your physician . `` i really appreciate when patients bring in information that they found online , because it allows me to guide my instruction and plan based on their true concerns , '' __burgert__ said . `` people get scared when they get sick and hurt , and they want to use multiple sources of information to help themselves . the internet adds to that physician 's expertise in order to do that . '' remember , though , knowing how to use the internet does n't make you a doctor . google does n't count as a second opinion . if you 're unhappy with your doc 's diagnosis , go get one the traditional way . putting off the inevitable . if your ailment is n't going away , all the __symptom-checking__ and mayo __clinic-ing__ in the world is n't going to help you . make a doctor 's appointment . like , right now . sites like __zocdoc__ make it super easy -lrb- and free ; doctors pay to be listed -rrb- to set up an appointment asap , so no whining that you 'll have to wait two weeks to see a doc and maybe by then `` it '' will have gone away . unless , of course , `` it '' is that white bread you just ate . in that case , please stop calling my dad .

'' the confusion only got worse after malaysia airlines mistakenly told kuala lumpur air traffic controllers they could see the flight somewhere over cambodia . it took an hour and a half to clear this up , after malaysia airlines admitted to controllers they were only looking at the projected flight track . malaysia airlines ceo ahmad __jauhari__ yahya said the misinformation was a momentary lapse by a company employee . `` our information was only to be as a guide . we are not an __atc__ per se . we do n't have radar , '' he told cnn . the watch supervisor then waited another two hours to activate the rescue coordination center . still another hour went by before before kuala lumpur issued the distress signal . no explanation for the delay is given in the interim report , which is composed of factual data and provides no conclusions or recommendations . after the air traffic controllers lost contact with mh370 , the plane continued to fly within the range of multiple radar systems belonging to four different countries . yet little seems to have been done with the data in the immediate hours after the plane disappeared . the interim report says that `` for unknown reasons '' indonesia 's __medan__ radar did not see the flight . and thailand `` did not pay much attention , '' since mh370 's flight path did not fall within its borders . malaysian military radar tracked the flight for an additional hour , including its turn back across the malay peninsula . despite this information , search and rescue teams did not begin expanding the search area for a full day . though the interim report makes no mention of it , a failure by the malaysian military to alert others to the relevant radar data may be blame . a briefing document prepared by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- __icao__ -rrb- said military authorities failed to share the final radar fix of mh370 with their civilian counterparts for 20 hours . cnn approached malaysia 's ministry of defence for comment but is yet to receive a response . another working document notes that mh370 's turn back might have been discovered much earlier , if the military and non-military agencies had coordinated better . `` in essence , a week or more was lost in the initial search because of poor __civil/military__ cooperation , '' reads the __icao__ working document . the interim report released by malaysian investigators on sunday provides no information about when the military radar data was shared with other authorities . it 's impossible to know if a __speedier__ response from air traffic controllers , or more immediate access to radar data , would have changed the course of events for mh370 . but it would have provided authorities with more time , either to track the flight or to search the ocean before the batteries died in the emergency locator beacons . looking back at the series of miscommunication between air traffic controllers and the radar lapses also provides valuable lessons that could help future search and rescue operations . though the mh370 investigation team did not draw lessons in the current report , it plans to provide safety recommendations in the months ahead . journalist chan kok __leong__ contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     new delhi , india -lrb- cnn -rrb- the north korean ambassador in bangladesh issued an apology after one of the embassy 's diplomats was caught carrying 27 kilograms -lrb- 59 pounds -rrb- of undeclared gold into the country 's main airport in dhaka , according to officials in bangladesh . north korean officials could not be reached for comment . meanwhile , state media in the largely isolated communist country has not yet reported on the incident . __kazi__ muhammad __ziauddin__ , a top official in bangladesh 's customs agency , told cnn his officers discovered the gold on the afternoon of march 5th , after the diplomat arrived on a singapore airlines flight . __ziauddin__ said customs officials had received a confidential tip that a north korean diplomat would be carrying `` illegal items . '' `` it was very tough . we have to be very careful and sensitive when we deal with a diplomat , '' __ziauddin__ said , referring to the vienna convention , which affords diplomats certain degrees of consular immunity . he said the suspect , whom he identified as son young nam , the first secretary of north korea 's embassy in dhaka , initially refused to allow his baggage to be searched . `` he said there is no way we can open or scan his bag , '' __ziauddin__ said . `` at first he said ` this is an electric motor . ' after further questioning he changed his mind and told us , ` these are __cipher__ machines and very confidential . ' '' eventually , customs officers opened the diplomat 's bag and found the undeclared goods , that included 170 gold bars and golden ornaments . at current market prices , the gold would be valued at around $ 1 million . entering bangladesh without declaring this quantity of precious metal is a violation of the country 's customs regulations . an official with bangladesh 's foreign secretary , speaking to cnn on condition of anonymity , said his government lodged a protest with the north korean ambassador . it 's far too early to jump to conclusions about whether the alleged gold smuggling incident could be an isolated example of corruption or an effort to move official funds . due to international sanctions , north korea faces substantial obstacles when trying to access international banking systems . `` it would be interesting to see if -lsb- the diplomat -rsb- is disciplined when he gets back '' to north korea , said john __delury__ , associate professor at __yonsei__ university 's graduate school of international studies . `` that would be a way of saying whether or not he 's a corrupt diplomat . '' according to the foreign secretary 's office in bangladesh , the north korean diplomat allegedly caught carrying the gold has since left the country . cnn 's k.j. kwon contributed from seoul .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- with the ongoing protests over the shooting death by police of black teenager tony robinson in madison , wisconsin , the racist chanting of fraternity members at the university of oklahoma , and now the inexcusable shootings of two police officers in ferguson , missouri , it 's safe to say that the __always-strained__ race relations in this country are being pushed to the breaking point . and the point with the most stress is the delicate relationship between police forces and the minority communities that they serve . to approach things from a more positive angle , the situation is dire enough that we absolutely have to try to uncover the good and not dwell on the negative . the best time to make things better is when it seems that everything is getting worse . this unacceptable status quo can motivate us to take the necessary steps to address the problems , which are not going to disappear unless we honestly deal with them . when things are going wrong , responsible people can begin by saying the right things . president obama said on twitter , `` violence against police is unacceptable . our prayers are with the officers in mo. . path to justice is one all of us must travel together . '' the congressional black caucus issued a statement saying , `` the cbc understands the frustrations in ferguson , but a response of violence is not the answer during this transformative moment in our country . '' and attorney general eric holder noted , `` this was not someone trying to bring healing to ferguson . ... this was a damn punk , a punk who was trying to sow discord . '' for the most part , authorities in missouri have been careful not to blame the peaceful protesters . surely , not all responses have been as measured , but the gravity of the situation will hopefully bring out the best in people . while we pause for a moment to let passions cool , we can use the time to consider how best to move forward with common resolve instead of mutual __recrimination__ . the way forward is to engage citizens in the community -- to bring them into the room when decisions are being made about policing policies and procedures to make sure that those policies and procedures address the community 's real concerns . and it 's about putting law enforcement officers in the community as welcome members of that community -- as __guarantors__ of the safety and security of the people instead of intimidating outside forces . this approach would benefit both the community and the police . i 'm certain that officers would rather be appreciated and valued by the people they serve than be pressured to fill city coffers by issuing unnecessary citations , as noted in the doj report on ferguson . nobody becomes a cop because they secretly long to be a collection agent . one of the easiest ways to integrate law enforcement officers into the community is to physically put them on the sidewalks by increasing the number of cops who work good old-fashioned foot beats . officers who view the world through a patrol car window are separated from the people they serve by more than a sheet of glass . being encased in a vehicle __alienates__ a person from the world around them . the cop on the beat is not just a quaint notion from old movies , he can be a bridge between police forces and the people they serve . another idea is to give cops bicycles , which has brought so many law enforcement officials in touch with other cyclists in the community . lack of community policing is one of the shortcomings cited in the doj report on ferguson . in areas where the gulf between law enforcement and the neighborhood is too wide , mediators can be used to initially bring the two sides together . after all , both sides ultimately have the same goal of safe and peaceful neighborhoods . both police departments and members of the community can take proactive steps to come together on more than a purely professional level . a tech services company in the south bronx recently hosted a video game competition with police officers and residents of the neighborhood . the event left local teenagers saying things about the cops like `` basically they 're like us . '' ultimately , police should be considered members of the community -- a notion that needs to be encouraged by police departments and neighborhoods alike . communities can make the local cops part of their neighborhood celebrations . new orleans police det. winston harbin became a minor internet celebrity for his impromptu dancing with local people during mardi gras . besides just being fun , harbin 's interaction with the community helped foster the type of mutual appreciation and respect that are essential to effective community policing . fear and mistrust among minority communities toward police are the legacy of many decades of racism , unequal treatment , bias , subjective stereotyping and lack of opportunity . it is times like now , when that anger and resentment are boiling , that we address it . with the right approach , we can begin to change the attitude between the black community and the police from `` __handsupdo__ __n'tshoot__ '' to `` __handstogetherintrust__ .

that 's the question . at this point , __runcible__ as much a provocation as an actual product . the __three-person__ team , which has been working with the san francisco design studio box clever on the concept for nearly a year , has some prototype hardware and a crude sketch of an operating system , but they 've still got a long way to go . they 've got a few vague ideas for applications . one is a sort of dashboard that gives you an overview of activity on your social media accounts . another is a __compass-style__ mapping system that encourages wandering instead of pure __a-to-b__ efficiency . but they 're more enthusiastic about the philosophy behind it all : they want to see applications that __distill__ information and streamline interaction , software that __constrains__ the smartphone experience as it exists today . all this is easier said than done , of course . throwing out centuries of rectangular thinking and starting from scratch ai n't easy . plus , it 's not clear that people really want constraint to begin with . smartphones are distracting , sure , but they 're also incredibly useful and immensely entertaining and maybe a little distraction is a fair price to pay for all the good stuff . still , even as a hint of a possible device , __runcible__ is compelling . for one thing , the company 's hardware model feels great in the hand -lrb- the team 's hardware guy , george __arriola__ , came from sony , where he helped design the playstation 4 . -rrb- the model 's curved back brings to mind the very first iphone -- and makes you consider how each successive generation has become a little bit harder to hold . and though __unformed__ , the vision for the software is interesting too . if today 's interactive __rectangles__ and infinite feeds signal that there 's always more stuff just outside the frame , circles could offer something more self-contained , more complete . maybe even something actively inefficient . __rectangles__ are beautiful and functional . circles are zen . a circular device would sever the link to the printed page , the tv and the computer , and invite developers to look elsewhere for metaphor and inspiration . pocket watches and __compasses__ . __microscopes__ and telescopes . peep holes , port holes , and __wormholes__ . dials , buttons , and other circular controls . 15 incredible photos that 'll remind you to be __awed__ by planet earth . if nothing else , the concept could be valuable simply for helping us identify some of the assumptions and habits that __underlie__ our existing devices . maybe thinking about circles could help us make our __rectangles__ better . __runcible__ is just one scrappy , literal attempt to abandon the rectangle . but similar thinking is happening elsewhere . android wear , google 's smartwatch operating system , __reconsiders__ what apps should look like on a tiny circular display . apple watch is in some ways another rectangle , but its real estate is limited enough that it will also encourage new , less rectangular thinking . -lrb- note how its home screen ditches iphone 's grid of icons for a blob of circular ones . also note the recent rise of circular avatars over the traditional square ones in apps and interfaces of all kinds -rrb- . we 've seen how sensors can be harnessed to __choreograph__ experiences that happen outside of the frame entirely , as with disney 's magic bands , which usher you through the company 's parks . and then of course there are technologies like augmented reality and virtual reality , where your nose is effectively pressed so close to the glass that the frame disappears entirely . here , the screen is less of a window , more of a lens . the only frame is your field of vision . __rectangles__ will endure . they 're easy , they 're efficient . but as new components and manufacturing techniques make it easier to experiment with other forms , we 'll likely find people exploring the unique effects they can produce . just recently , in fact , we saw an instance of a tech industry giant leaving the glass rectangle behind in a very big way . in a 10 minute video , google proposed a new headquarters that would leaves boxy buildings behind in favor of __tent-like__ structures draped in glass . these buildings do n't have vertical windows or horizontal windows . they 're nothing but windows , or maybe they 're so radical that the concept of `` window '' does n't even really apply . whatever the case , there 's nothing rectangular about them , and google 's convinced they 're the future . read more from wired : . there 's a super-fast method for boarding planes , but airlines are n't using it . 21 __awesomely__ __well-designed__ products we 're dying to own . what cities would look like if lit only by the stars . subscribe to wired magazine for less than $ 1 an issue and get a free gift ! click here ! copyright 2011 wired.com .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the attempts by some in the gop to undermine president barack obama 's iranian policy certainly seem extraordinary . first , the republican leadership invited benjamin netanyahu to speak to congress without consulting the white house , and he duly warned against softening of the west 's line on iran . now , 47 senators have written an open letter to the iranian regime to advise that any deal agreed to with obama could be reversed after the 2016 presidential election . it is an astonishing move . but this is not , strictly speaking , unique . people in both parties have done far more remarkable things in the past . back in 1983 , sen. edward kennedy tried to set up a personal diplomatic channel with the soviet union -- effectively __sidestepping__ president ronald reagan . working through proxies , he suggested that he visit moscow to meet with the communist leadership and offered to help them make their case to the american people as to why they preferred dialogue over confrontation . as washington post journalist vincent __bzdek__ notes in his book `` the kennedy legacy , '' this occurred close to a u.s. presidential election , and some conservatives have interpreted it as an act of treason -- perhaps even a breach of the logan act , which forbids private citizens from engaging in diplomacy with the goal of changing foreign policy . one might argue that the senator was motivated by high ideals : he had a clear record of campaigning to reduce cold war tensions and thought reagan was mishandling the soviets . on more than one occasion , kennedy politicized foreign policy while in the senate . in my book on the 1980 democratic presidential primaries , i note that kennedy opposed jimmy carter 's hard-line stance on the soviet invasion of afghanistan -- a position that was well-intentioned , prophetic and somewhat advantageous to kennedy 's campaign for the democratic nomination . but it 's not only democrats who have done that . step forward , richard nixon . in 1968 , the presidential election looked close . with the johnson administration edging toward a peace deal in vietnam , nixon 's team rolled the dice . according to an account in politico , anna __chennault__ , a republican activist , was given a message to pass onto the south vietnamese government : if they undermined the peace talks by being stubborn , the democrats would lose the election and nixon as the next president would offer them better terms . the south vietnamese indeed proved __intransigent__ , and the republicans won the white house . no evidence exists directly tying nixon personally to the conspiracy , but we now know for sure that it happened and it 's far hard to imagine that it would have gone ahead without his knowledge . there is a view that it bordered on treason and -- again -- makes the 2015 gop efforts look tame by comparison . the extreme lengths that kennedy and nixon went to behind the scenes underlines the point that foreign policy has always been a deeply partisan matter that can often end in a challenge to executive authority . it 's true that the spirit of the constitution indicates that the country is expected to speak with one voice on foreign policy through the president . but such harmony has n't always been possible . recall that congress and the carter white house tore themselves apart over the panama canal treaties . that the reagan administration 's policy in nicaragua was so controversial that his staffers sent aid to the rebels through back channels , and the __then-democratic__ house speaker , jim wright , was accused of presenting a private peace plan to the left-wing government . that bill clinton 's 1994 nuclear deal with north korea was criticized by both republicans and democrats . or that liberal democrats did their best to defund the iraq war . as damian __paletta__ writes , foreign policy is generally conducted quietly by the white house through executive agreements that pass without comment . but the idea that foreign policy is beyond partisanship is naïve , and disagreements have gone public when the political conditions are appropriate . the particular matter of the iran talks is sensitive for the republicans because it involves the electoral holy trinity of obama , israel and the presidential primaries . they were n't going to walk away from this one , and we can hardly be surprised that they have n't . the democrats would do the same if the situation were reversed , as they have many times in the past . in a republic purposefully designed to have limited executive power , with a competitive __two-party__ system bolted on to keep its politics fluid , this was arguably inevitable .

'' and `` grace and disgrace , '' much like aspiring jazz musicians listened to __saxophonist__ john __coltrane__ and amateur boxers studied tapes of sugar ray robinson -- for clues to greatness and inspiration . craddock elevated preaching to an art . he was often called a preaching genius . rather than deliver a sermon like a lecture -- an __intro__ , three main points and a conclusion -- he developed an `` __inductive__ '' __conversational__ style of preaching . his sermons unfolded like a short story -- there was __foreshadowing__ , plot twists , dialogue ; language of startling beauty and surprise endings . the way he ended his sermons was as memorable as what he said . he would abruptly stop , turn from the pulpit , and quietly sit as the audience sat in silence . people did n't applaud or shout hallelujah after his sermons . they were too busy absorbing what he had just said . the rev. barbara brown taylor , an author and world-renowned preacher , once said of craddock : `` he spoke of __kierkegaard__ as easily as he spoke of the indianapolis 500 . he quoted __kafka__ as helpfully as corinthians ... but he was also someone who noticed a lot about ordinary human life on earth .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- `` this is going to be a test for serena williams . we 're going to find out what she 's made of . how mentally tough she really is . '' those were the words of tennis analyst mary joe fernandez in 2001 , early into serena williams ' decider with kim clijsters in the final of one of tennis ' most prestigious tournaments . the match was being televised on one of the biggest sports networks in the world , espn . the then 17-year-old clijsters had just held to love amid vociferous cheers and -- in a breach of tennis etiquette -- a large portion of the fans on center court at the event now known as the bnp paribas open roared __approvingly__ when williams struck a double fault to begin the next game . despite williams growing up about 130 miles away in a suburb of los angeles , while clijsters hailed from belgium , there was clearly no __home-court__ advantage . williams ' father , richard , and older sister , venus , were booed as they made their way to their seats prior to the finale , with richard claiming in usa today he was the victim of racial abuse . venus williams , meanwhile , said in a press conference at her next tournament she `` heard whatever he heard . '' it was richard williams who shaped his daughters into grand slam winners from a humble background , bereft of the type of money used to help manufacture many a champion . `` one guy said , ' i wish it was ' 75 , we 'd skin you alive , ' '' richard williams told usa today . `` i had trouble holding back tears . i think indian wells disgraced america . '' charlie __pasarell__ , then the tournament director , said in the same story that he did n't discount richard williams was racially abused . cnn.com did not hear back from __pasarell__ when it put in an interview request for him and clijsters declined an interview request . the fans ' reaction apparently stemmed from the sisters ' semifinal -- or lack of it . venus williams pulled out a mere minutes prior to the start , citing a knee injury . whispers of richard williams __pre-determining__ the outcome grew , no doubt aided by the comments of elena __dementieva__ . after venus williams beat __dementieva__ in the quarterfinals , the russian said the sisters ' father would `` decide '' who won . serena williams , who was 19 back then , ultimately passed the ` test ' that day against clijsters , judging by the result : a three-set win . serena williams has certainly , too , shown her mental toughness over the years , adding 18 grand slam singles titles to the one she won prior to 2001 . but what transpired tarnished the tournament , the sport and hurt one of tennis ' all-time greats to such an extent that she stayed away from indian wells . until now . serena williams plays her first match in indian wells in 14 years on friday , saying she was `` following her heart '' in deciding to return . in the years that have passed since 2001 , williams went from teen to young adult to veteran , all the while collecting major titles elsewhere . `` it has been difficult for me to forget spending hours crying in the indian wells locker room after winning in 2001 , driving back to los angeles feeling as if i had lost the biggest game ever -- not a mere tennis game but a bigger fight for equality , '' serena williams told time.com in february . `` emotionally it seemed easier to stay away . `` there are some who say i should never go back . there are others who say i should 've returned years ago . i understand both perspectives very well and wrestled with them for a long time . `` i 'm just following my heart on this one . '' raymond moore , a former owner of the tournament and now its chief executive , was `` elated '' to have serena williams back in the field . `` in the past , the things that happened , there were no winners , '' moore told cnn.com . `` i think it was a terrible incident . regrettable from all sides . now , serena has been able to change that . we 're grateful , excited and happy and we 're going to welcome her with open arms . `` in terms of her reception , i would like her to be here feeling that her decision was received with the greatest and warmest reception possible . '' but serena williams will be the lone grand slam winner in her family attending . serena speaks about nerves before 1st match back at indian wells . even with the best efforts of the tournament -- now owned by billionaire larry ellison -- venus williams is continuing her boycott , as is richard williams , according to moore . the siblings ' mom , __oracene__ price , will be alongside serena williams , though , added moore . serena williams told reporters in indian wells on thursday that her father , mother and venus williams gave her their blessing when she contemplated coming back to indian wells . `` we wanted to get venus , '' said moore . `` in fact we 'd like to welcome the whole family . but venus i think is not quite in the same place as serena is . and so we 've not been successful in enticing her to enter or take a wild card . `` but __oracene__ is coming and so are some other family members . '' serena williams scoffed at suggestions that the sisters ' match in indian wells -- or any other between them -- was fixed . `` throughout my whole career , integrity has been everything to me , '' she told time . `` it is also everything and more to venus . the false allegations that our matches were fixed hurt , cut and ripped into us deeply . `` the __under-current__ of racism was painful , confusing and unfair . in a game i loved with all my heart , at one of my most cherished tournaments , i suddenly felt unwelcome , alone and afraid . '' reflecting on the incident , bart mcguire , the chief executive of the women 's tour in 2001 , said venus williams had been suffering from a genuine injury and that the notion that richard williams dictated the outcome of matches between his daughters was off the mark . but he admitted things could have been handled better . venus williams , for example , might have explained her withdrawal to fans on court and then signed autographs , he said , citing the example of last year 's world tour finals . roger federer withdrew from the final in london -- but not before he addressed fans and signed autographs . what happened in the final between serena williams and clijsters was awful , said mcguire . `` i thought it was horrible , '' he told cnn.com . `` i thought it was very tough on the players . `` by that time i 'd known enough to know that venus had been significantly injured and that it was not a set-up of any kind . i thought it was unfair to serena and kim . '' serena williams is twice a champion at the tournament and winning this year would be `` fantastic , '' said moore . but even if not , he added : `` i think it 's a wonderful ending in closing an ugly chapter . we 're just looking forward , we 're not looking backward . ''

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the news was stunning to hear : a young woman , 18-year-old michelle carter , was charged with involuntary manslaughter for allegedly sending text messages urging her friend to commit suicide . how could a young person -- who was a close friend of the deceased , conrad roy , 18 -- allegedly do such a horrifying thing ? and what are the legal ramifications of what a teen says online or in a text ? but a lesser discussed point this tragic story raises is how quickly a teen can go from normal everyday life to facing severe , life-altering legal consequences . that is why lisa green , author of the informative new book `` on your case : a compassionate -lrb- and only slightly bossy -rrb- legal guide for every stage of a woman 's life , '' believes every parent of a teen should have a criminal defense lawyer in mind and at the ready -- just in case . `` to me this is the __unrecognized__ area that parents , particularly parents of teens , miss all the time , '' said green during a recent interview at cnn 's studios . `` so many of our friends have armies of tutors , extracurricular activities , all sorts of angles covered ... but when it comes to the law , there 's this black hole . '' mom arrested for leaving 9-year-old alone at park . green , a journalist , lawyer and television legal analyst , says people often think of the law as scary and intimidating and believe they do n't need to worry about it because their kid is never going to get into legal trouble . whether it 's a case as serious as carter 's involuntary manslaughter charge , or a simple allegation of vandalism , parents need to be prepared , green said . `` i can not count the number of kids i know , good kids , who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time , '' said green . `` i have now two young adults , and when they were going through their teenage years , it was a simple matter of a party that went wrong , a group of kids in the park when the police stop by and have some questions , bringing something to school they should n't have . `` and in each of those cases , a little bit of knowledge of the law , a little bit of knowledge of what their rights are , the right way to behave , would have saved parents a heck of a lot of grief . '' green thinks parents should think about the issue in the same way they would track down a good __orthopedist__ if their child breaks a bone , or the best tutor if their child is struggling before the sat . parents ' house seized after son 's drug bust . `` i am not saying that parents need to go out and get their own law degrees ... but just dipping your finger into the topic will help you understand what 's available to you to help you parent better , '' she said . she gives some real-life examples especially in the social media age . for instance , what if a teen is asked by a school administrator to turn over his or her cell phone based on allegations the teen was sending inappropriate texts ? what parents should know , green said , is that a school ca n't open a cell phone for no reason at all . `` they need to have reasonable suspicion that something 's wrong , '' said green , who said parents would be wise to talk to their teens about what 's appropriate and what 's not when it comes to handling such requests from school officials . `` if you 're asked , as a child , for a locker search , to open a phone , to open a laptop , if it 's your property , pause and ask if you could call mom and dad , '' she said . `` we can act whether we 're lawyers or not as that first line of defense . '' green also says that parents of __college-bound__ teens should spend a few minutes looking online at the school 's code of conduct . `` they do n't tell you about it during that fantastic tour with the kid walking backwards as your child is looking around to say , ` who can i party with ? ' but it 's a really important set of information because different schools have different levels of tolerance '' for activities such as drinking on campus , she said . and even before teens head off to college , parents should know about social host laws , where parents could be held criminally responsible or face civil damages if teens drink alcohol in their home and then go off and do something inappropriate or even tragic . scary consequences for parents hosting underage drinking . more than 150 cities or counties and 24 states currently have such laws on their books , according to mothers against drunk driving . in some cases , parents can be held liable even if they did n't know the drinking was taking place . `` it does n't have to be you with the shaker , like an episode of ` mad men , ' serving up __manhattans__ to a group of grateful teens , '' said green . `` if you 've made it possible in your home , if you do n't lock your liquor cabinet -- i never did -- and all of a sudden kids are drinking , that could be a problem as well . '' while green is passionate about educating parents on why they need to think about the law , she stresses that bad behavior by teens still needs to be punished either legally or at home . `` i am not advocating that kids should be absolved of responsibility . if a kid does something wrong , if they broke the law , they ought to be punished appropriately by it . but we also live in a society where we have legal rights , and i want parents to know that they should be aware of what those are so they can help their child use better judgment . '' so if after reading this , you are moved to try to find a criminal defense lawyer , how on earth do you go about finding one ? green 's advice is to ask friends and colleagues for referrals and also consult with your state bar association , since you would want someone in your state who has experience with criminal defense issues . then she says you should call up and interview a few lawyers , asking them everything from how much their services would cost -lrb- that can vary -rrb- , to who would handle the work , to what their philosophy is about the law and teens ' rights . `` you may or may not end up being friends afterwards , but that 's not as important as feeling secure that your lawyer is approaching the situation in a way that feels right for you . '' do you think it 's important for parents of teens to be aware of the law and their children 's legal rights ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace -lrb- __@kellywallacetv__ -rrb- on twitter or cnn living on facebook .

'' he promised , `` i will surprise again , and i will show my leadership and stamina . '' herzog began his political career in 2003 , when he first won a seat in the knesset with the labor party . he held a variety of ministerial positions , including minister of housing and construction , minister of tourism , and minister of welfare and social services , before becoming leader of the labor party in 2013 . in those elections , he also became the leader of the opposition , as benjamin netanyahu won another term as prime minister . but when netanyahu called for early elections in 2014 , herzog pegged his bid for the premiership on social reform . `` what i run for is social justice . i will change the nature of the division of wealth in a fair and more balanced way , close inequality and give a sense of purpose to the people here in the workplace , in the housing , and in the cost of living , '' promised herzog . before the election , the issue of a nuclear iran garnered international headlines as it further aggravated tense relations between the white house and netanyahu . herzog , in a speech almost immediately after netanyahu 's address to congress , promised to work with the united states and european powers , not against , to ensure the safety of israel . he echoed that sentiment in an interview with cnn 's elise labott . `` a nuclear-armed iran is dangerous to world peace , is dangerous to our region , is dangerous to israel . as leader of israel , i will never accept a nuclear-armed iran . never . and all options are on the table . '' in these elections , negotiations with the palestinians have n't been one of the major issues , but herzog promised to restart the stalled peace talks with the palestinian authority . `` i will do my best to ignite a political process with our palestinian neighbors . ... although i can not promise 100 % results , i promise 100 % effort . '' herzog comes from israeli political royalty . his grandfather , rabbi yitzhak __halevi__ herzog , was the first chief rabbi of the state of israel . his father , __chaim__ herzog , was an army general , an ambassador to the united nations and the president of israel . herzog believes it is his destiny to be the next prime minister of israel . `` what i carry with me is a unique legacy , a family legacy , but most important , an experience that brings me to be able to lead our nation .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- thirty years ago , a journey across europe meant a passport full of stamps , a wallet full of different currencies and plenty of time spent waiting in line to be __glared__ at by border officials . that all began to change in june 1985 , when the continent 's countries began signing up to the schengen agreement -- a deal that lifted frontier controls between cooperating neighbors . today , 20 years after it came into force , with more than 26 states now participating , schengen has completely altered the experience of traversing europe . nowhere is this more visible than at the old crossing points -- places that were once hives of activity but are now ghostly , vacated shells of their former selves . not entirely forgotten though . spanish photographer ignacio evangelista spent several years __criss-crossing__ the continent to capture these abandoned checkpoints on camera for a project he calls `` after schengen . '' the result is a fascinating gallery of images that charts the unusual architecture of places whose fate has been intertwined with europe 's __ever-evolving__ political and economic allegiances . `` i do n't know why but from many years ago , i feel very attracted to situations or places where the natural and the artificial come together , sometimes a little bit in conflict , '' evangelista tells cnn , explaining his interest in frontiers . he says he spent his formative years poring over the world atlas , __marveling__ at the __straight-line__ borders carved by __colonialists__ across the map of africa and wondering why europeans could n't iron the kinks out of their own __squiggled__ frontiers . `` when you are a young child in front of a map you feel ... you have the whole world in front of you and you can travel with your mind of course , with your imagination , '' he says . as a young adult in the early 1990s , evangelista experienced many of these borders firsthand when he embarked on an __interailing__ trip -- a __country-hopping__ rite of passage that sees many young europeans take advantage of cheap __pan-continental__ train tickets . `` before , when i was young , if you traveled from spain to germany you had to cross three countries and take three currencies , '' he recalls . `` once i was traveling with my friend , __interailing__ ... from italy to greece , we had to cross the old yugoslavia . `` i think into the night , 2 or 3 a.m. , we cross the border from italy into yugoslavia and the train stopped . we were sleeping , of course . then three or four soldiers come into the train and shouted at everybody , very aggressively , like in a spy movie . `` we waited half an hour , then half an hour later the train went on . it was exciting , even funny as i was 18 years old , but now it 's not so funny . '' as evangelista points out , in a europe __cleaved__ by the cold war , many borders were not just the cultural dividing lines they are today . back then they were fortifications __demarcating__ places of oppression and freedom . the checkpoints themselves were sometimes places of fear , of hostile bureaucracy -- a past evangelista says lingers on in the buildings left behind . `` for me it 's fascinating because you can see the passage of the time , the human footprint . `` these places had a very strong coercive role , people had to stop the car and the policeman had to ask you who you are , you showed your passport , maybe you had to open your bags . the police had the power to not let you go on . `` it 's interesting to me , looking at these places now they are a little bit spooky , because at most of them you can feel this ghostly atmosphere . '' the frontier buildings range in size and style , from giant soviet declarations of authority that loom over major highways to tiny huts in deep , dark forests . europe 's richer countries tend to maintain old posts , while less wealthier states seem content to let them deteriorate , evangelista says . some , he says , are gone completely , marked only on maps and located using gps trackers or by talking to locals . a strong supporter for an open europe at a time when some of the continent 's nations are talking about severing the close economic and political bonds they share with their neighbors , evangelista recalls one encounter that underscored the human side to his project . while setting up his camera at a checkpoint on the __austria-hungary__ frontier , he watched as a man drove in from the austrian side and parked , followed by a woman , two minutes later , from the hungarian side . `` they began to speak and they were kissing very much . after 10 minutes they went back their separate ways , and i thought , before the schengen agreement , this couple had no future .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- i 'm __candida__ moss and i am professor of new testament and early christianity at the university of notre dame . i was an adviser on the `` true cross '' episode and served as one of the many on-camera experts in cnn 's `` finding jesus '' series , which currently airs on sundays . viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the `` finding jesus '' facebook page during the show . below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them . my apologies to everyone i did n't get to . feel free to tweet your questions to me directly . herb __scribner__ : can anyone explain to me what the bible 's deal is with 40 __days/nights__ ? moss : it 's more an interest in the number 40 . in the hebrew bible the people of israel wander in the wilderness for 40 years before they reach the holy land . the flood lasts for 40 days and nights ; moses spends 40 days and nights on the mountain ; goliath spends 40 days encouraging the __israelites__ to challenge him before david steps up ; 40 is a common age for people to be when they get married ; in the book of judges it is always 40 years between judges ; and david and solomon each reigned for 40 years . what we can take away from all of this is that people in the ancient world saw 40 as suggesting a full , complete period of time . it 's sort of like a narrative stock number , in the way that modern jokes follow the rule of three . __yalanda__ m. price : was there any division between the followers of jesus and the followers of john the baptist ? moss : one of the interesting things about the relationship between jesus and john the baptist is that john does n't lay down his tools and follow jesus after he __baptizes__ him . nor , it seems , did john 's disciples . they had separate ministries and , while there may have been contact between the two groups , they were also de facto competitors in the ancient religious marketplace . there are some hints in the new testament that jesus and his followers had to differentiate themselves from john by stating that jesus ' baptism was better -lrb- acts __11:6__ -rrb- and countering the idea that jesus was actually john raised from the dead -lrb- matthew __14:2__ -rrb- some scholars argue that these references are evidence of tension between followers of jesus and followers of john . mark __goodacre__ answers your questions about the shroud of turin . jeffery graff : can the dna tests on the bones indicate whether he is a jew or even whether he is of the tribe of levi ? moss : i 'm so glad someone brought up dna . the dna tests on the bulgarian bones yielded only mitochondrial dna -lrb- dna passed down by the mother -rrb- , not the more reliable nuclear dna -lrb- the kind of dna referred to in forensic investigations -rrb- . in the original study of the bulgarian relics -lrb- of which i was a part -rrb- the mitochondrial dna revealed that the bulgarian relics were of `` probable __semitic__ origin . '' thinking back to my time in the laboratory with the copenhagen scientists , i recall that the lead investigator estimated that the probability was about 75 % . the episode last night stated things a little too sharply when it said that the bones were from a __middle-eastern__ man . as for the more specific question about the genetics of jews and members of the tribe of levi : current scientific technology does not reveal this kind of information even if start-up genetic testing companies promise this kind of information . cyndi rosenthal : are there any other historical references of john the baptist outside of the bible ? daniel josé camacho : any __extra-biblical__ sources that shed light on historical figure of john the baptist ? moss : -lrb- these questions are on a similar topic , so i 've chosen to answer them together . -rrb- actually there is external __attestation__ for the life and importance of john the baptist . this is important because it 's fairly rare to find this kind of evidence for ancient figures outside the writings of their followers . the jewish historian __josephus__ mentions john the baptist in his book , `` the jewish antiquities . '' __josephus__ describes john as a `` good man '' who possessed `` virtue '' and had `` great influence '' over the people . according to __josephus__ , herod put john the baptist to death because he was afraid that he might raise a rebellion . this gives us another -- arguably more historical -- perspective on why john was executed and provides further evidence about just how important john was in his own day . watch the latest full episode anytime on cnngo . daniel josé camacho : wait , how did jesus get `` our father '' prayer from johnny b ??? did n't catch that . moss : i 'm also really glad someone brought this up , because i wondered about it too . in the gospel of luke , one of jesus ' disciples says , `` lord , teach us to pray , as john taught his disciples . '' it 's an interesting request that tells us something about john the baptist 's ministry and the demanding characters of jesus ' disciples ! in luke , jesus responds to this request by teaching them the lord 's prayer . we do n't know that the lord 's prayer came from john , and personally i do n't think it did ; i think this is just how luke shaped his version of events . but if you were just reading luke you could come to that conclusion .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- could mobile technology turn the tide in the fight to eliminate racism from football ? anti-racism organization kick it out -lrb- __kio__ -rrb- says there 's been a 35 % rise in fans reporting abusive behavior committed by other fans -- and that 's largely due to a new phone app . `` the app has had a massive impact , '' __kio__ media and communications manager richard bates told cnn , noting that it accounted for 27 % of all complaints . `` __self-policing__ is so important when it comes to stamping out racism in football . people are confident that their complaints will be taken seriously . '' the 184 reported incidents recorded during the last five months of 2014 covered racial and religious discrimination , as well as sexual orientation , gender and disability offenses . the increase was measured against the same period the year before . __kio__ 's mobile phone application , which was released in 2013 , encourages fans to report incidents anonymously by pressing a `` report it ! '' tab and entering the name of the football ground , positioning of the offender , and incident details . although contact details of the person reporting the incident are requested , __kio__ emphasized that the anonymity of the tool is key . every single objection logged by fans , either on the phone , via email , or on the app , triggers an investigation by the english football association -lrb- fa -rrb- . these include 73 incidents on social media -lrb- a 24 % increase -rrb- , which have so far led to 21 instances of the offender being identified , and at times having their accounts deleted . the fa , which released its own witness complaint guidelines in 2013 , encouraged fans to be proactive in flagging up incidents . `` reporting abuse , whether witnessed or experienced , is an important part of the game 's overall anti-discrimination work , '' said an fa spokesperson . `` there are clear ways for players and fans to do this , and these improved procedures should result in more reports in the future . '' bates admitted that it takes `` bravery and courage '' for fans to record photographic evidence on their phones , but pointed to the effect british expatriate paul nolan has had after he filmed chelsea fans physically stopping a black man from getting on the paris metro last month . the amateur video obtained by the guardian newspaper , and posted on its website , shows the man make multiple attempts to board a train at __richelieu-drouot__ station , only to be pushed away each time by a group of passengers . the chelsea fans can then be heard chanting : `` we 're racist , we 're racist and that 's the way we like it . '' chelsea were in france to play paris saint-germain in a champions league first-leg tie - europe 's premier football tournament -- which finished 1-1 . five people have been identified and suspended by chelsea , who have launched an ongoing investigation . later in february , __kio__ says it contacted the police over social media footage which showed men , thought to be west ham fans , singing anti-semitic songs on a train while traveling to tottenham hotspur 's white hart lane ground ahead of an english premier league game . `` would we know that these paris and london incidents had happened if they were n't on video ? '' bates asks , adding that __kio__ is considering an option to upload video and still images of offenders directly to a complaint log on the app . `` if you have video footage and you can issue that retrospectively , it can make it easier to identify the perpetrators , '' he says . in a report released in 2013 entitled `` english football 's inclusion and anti-discrimination action plan '' , the fa explicitly talks about `` raising confidence in the reporting and disciplinary process at grassroots level . '' __kio__ 's jurisdiction extends to all of english football , including the amateur ranks . it is one of the few independent bodies in world sports which __solicits__ complaints from fans in order to weed out abusive behavior . it also polices the actions of players , which has embroiled the organization in controversy of its own in the past . in 2012 , rio ferdinand refused to wear a __kio__ t-shirt before a match while playing for manchester united . he was protesting a perceived lack of response by the governing bodies against john terry after the chelsea defender was accused of racially abusing his brother , anton ferdinand of queens park rangers . terry was banned for four matches and fined # 220,000 by the fa for his actions .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered in cities across brazil this weekend , incensed by serious economic woes and a massive scandal involving the country 's oil company . the demonstrators have called for president dilma rousseff to be impeached . cnn correspondent shasta darlington , who lives in sao paulo , explains who the demonstrators are , why they 're mad and what could be in store for the president and the country . what do the protesters want ? they 're angry about the country 's economy being in shambles at a time when political corruption at the highest levels of government is alleged . if it were just one of those things , maybe we would n't be seeing this kind of turnout because brazilians have lived with corruption for decades and the economy was not doing well before the presidential election in october . but it 's all come to a head . political corruption -- let 's break that down . what 's the scandal about ? __petrobras__ is the national oil company . it 's one of the most powerful , richest companies in the country -- and has been counted among the largest in the world . it was very respected . people invested in it . rousseff , who won election in october by a slim margin , was -- before becoming president -- the chairwoman of __petrobras__ ' board of directors . she was chairwoman during much of the time that former oil company executives have told investigators that bribes were paid to __petrabras__ executives and politicians in order to secure contracts from __petrobras__ . in early march , the country 's highest court authorized the investigation which involves about 40 politicians , many of them from the president 's ruling workers ' party and the speakers of the house and senate . but rousseff has n't been accused of anything , right ? right . she 's not being investigated . protesters ' call for impeachment -- the formal process of accusing , because she 's not been accused of anything -- looks very unlikely . but , the public perception is that even if she did n't personally profit for this scheme , she was still the chairwoman at a time when it was supposedly happening and she should be held accountable . has she responded to the protesters ? she has . what she says is that she will not stand for corruption and she 's rooting it out . as proof , she contends , she 's given her attorney general free rein to investigate who is stealing from the state oil company . it 's important to know that the __petrobras__ scandal has been known publicly for at least a year and during rousseff 's election campaign , she said over and over that she would root out corruption . it 's also interesting that she is n't lashing out at protesters . she is saying she wo n't put up with violence -- and so far the protests have n't gotten violent . but she says that brazil is a democratic country and people have the right to protest . she comes from a left-wing background so that approach is fitting . you brought up that she is from the left-wing workers ' party . how is that significant ? the protests were mostly organized by the right-wing party that opposes rousseff ... organized by people who did n't vote for her . there are n't people out today protesting . the next demonstrations are scheduled for april 12 . i guess that goes to how organized these demonstrations really are -- setting an advance date like that . yes , well , that 's brazil . it 's so the word can get out on social media . if she 's not accused of anything and the protests are politically motivated , will the protests affect her presidency ? rousseff has four years ahead of her , it could end up being very hard for her govern . she won a little over half the vote in october and the people who did n't vote for her are still making their voices heard . and this __petrobras__ scandal is a problem . why was the election so close ? you have to bring it back to the economy . it had been slowing down , and traditionally the wealthier parts of the country like sao paulo have n't voted for rousseff 's party , the workers ' party . the country is at 7.5 % inflation . the april 12 protest is ahead but three or four months down the road , what might happen ? the senate and house speakers are rousseff 's allies and they are among those implicated in the __petrobras__ scheme . what if she is n't able to get badly needed legislation ? what will she do ? what will be party do ? these questions are hard to answer now . cnn 's ashley fantz in atlanta talked with cnn 's shasta darlington who lives and reports in brazil .

ARTICEL:     new delhi -lrb- cnn -rrb- thankfully , no one was wounded after crude bombs were hurled at a tamil news station in india on thursday . but the loud explosions injured a vital part of the world 's largest democracy : free speech . last week , when india 's government and a british __documentarian__ faced off over a film featuring a man imprisoned for a 2012 gang rape in south delhi , a little-known channel hundreds of miles away in southern india was waging its own battle . hardline hindu groups were angry with broadcaster __puthiya__ __thalaimurai__ for filming a show about the relevance of a traditional necklace -- called __mangalsutra__ in hindi and __thaali__ in tamil -- worn by married indian women . for them , the contents , as shown in the __promos__ , were offensive to hindu culture . the station planned to release the program sunday , international women 's day . but it canceled the telecast after demonstrations took place outside its office . protesters allegedly attacked one of its cameramen . four days later , the channel came under fire again , when four men on two motorbikes threw bombs into its compound in a predawn attack , authorities say . six people involved in the bombing have been arrested , said s. george , the commissioner of the southern indian city of chennai . their leader turned himself in separately , claiming responsibility for the attack , police said . `` the show wanted to give women a platform . we welcome all opinions and thoughts . but you can not strangle freedom of free expression by violent means and threats , '' said __shyam__ kumar , the ceo of new generation media corp. , which runs __puthiya__ __thalaimurai__ . `` we condemn the attack in the strongest possible terms , '' he told cnn . ` india 's daughter , ' the film banned by india : what did it show ? but india is no stranger to censorship imposed legally or forced by rowdy protesters . the country 's constitution guarantees freedom of expression , but not without restrictions . communities or people claiming their religious sentiments were hurt by anyone else 's opinion can file a lawsuit . authorities can seek restraining orders from local courts -- as they did to ban the recent bbc documentary `` india 's daughter '' -- by citing potential disorder . earlier last year , penguin india withdrew `` the hindus : an alternative history , '' a book by american academic wendy __doniger__ , after a local advocacy group accused the writer of __denigrating__ __hinduism__ . in december , a bollywood movie , `` __pk__ , '' came under attack over similar accusations when mobs tore apart its posters in parts of india . a satire on religious rituals , `` __pk__ '' became a roaring success by being one of the country 's highest-grossing movies . but india , home to one of the world 's largest film industries , has blocked several movies from screening . at least two films were not allowed last year . one of them featured the lives of the sikh assassins of prime minister indira gandhi , and the other centered on the violence in sri lanka in the closing months of its civil war . hounded by protests over his novel , perumal __murugan__ , a tamil author , announced quitting writing in a dramatic post on facebook in january . `` perumal __murugan__ , the writer is dead . as he is no god , he is not going to resurrect himself . he has no faith in rebirth . as an ordinary teacher , he will live as p __murugan__ . leave him alone , '' he said on facebook two months ago . religious and __caste-based__ organizations had slammed his novel `` __madhorubhagan__ , '' which depicted a childless wife taking part in an ancient festival allowing consensual sex between strangers . just last week , india blocked the bbc from airing `` india 's daughter '' because it included comments from one of the men convicted of raping a young student in a moving bus in new delhi in 2012 . the reason : the inmate 's views could create unrest . `` there 's a growing intolerance towards different shades of opinion . it 's a medieval mindset . what india needs is a concerted effort to move beyond it and embrace free expression in totality , '' said kumar , the new generation media chief executive .

'' it 's a sport where even driving ability often fails to overcome mechanical failures -- eventual world champion hamilton was forced to retire from last year 's race at albert park . but technical blunders do n't always end in disaster -- hamilton won the italian grand prix after experiencing mechanical faults early in the race , and finnish driver __valterri__ bottas lost a wheel in 2014 's opener before roaring to a __fifth-place__ finish . despite ricciardo 's previous disappointment , he 's ca n't wait to race on his home turf again next sunday . `` i definitely feel privileged to have a home race ... it just increases all the hype and all the excitement '' said ricciardo , adding that he would use `` all the australian flags and all the cheers to my advantage .

'' not everyone agreed with hicks , herself a navy wife whose husband is deployed . a facebook page titled `` you call yourself a photographer ? '' posted her photo and said that the use of the flag as a prop was a desecration -- and a bad picture . the u.s. flag code does state that the flag should never be used as `` wearing apparel , bedding , or __drapery__ . it should never be festooned , drawn back , nor up , in folds , but always allowed to fall free , '' according to a congressional research service report -lrb- pdf -rrb- . nor should it be `` used as a __receptacle__ for receiving , holding , carrying , or delivering anything .

ARTICEL:     andre spicer is professor of organizational behavior , cass business school at city university london . the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer . cnn is showcasing the work of the conversation , a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary . the content is produced solely by the conversation . __londonapple__ ceo tim cook has released the much-anticipated apple watch -- his company 's first new product since the ipad . cook said the new watch , in addition to telling the time , was a `` comprehensive health and fitness companion . '' but we 're unlikely to hear much about how people will actually use this new product for some time . our research has found that smartwatches certainly do have some benefits for users . but they also have a hidden , darker side which the companies selling them are unlikely to talk about . as part of a research project with alberto rizzoli , we have tried to understand what drives people to invest in smartwatches . one participant , a judge , hoped he could keep track of the deluge of emails during long hours in the courtroom when he had to pay attention -- and be seen to pay attention . the dilemma is familiar to many of us . we spend our days engaged in social interaction . huge proportions of our time are taken up with meetings or impromptu encounters with colleagues . however when we are in these meetings , our smartphone is buzzing away reminding us that our inbox is filling up . we may want to check these incoming messages , but know it would be rude to glance at our phone . when one of the first smartwatches came to market , the judge thought he had found the solution to this problem . we found that heavy smartwatch users valued how the devices helped them track information as it arrived while still appearing socially attentive . it also saved users the hassle of having to dig through their pockets or handbags to find a buzzing phone . surprisingly only about half the people we spoke with actually used all the health tracking technology built in to the watches . they were more interested in keeping abreast of their inbox than their calorie count . we also noticed a worrying side to these new devices as heavy users of the watches incorporate them into their daily routines -- we call it the `` phantom device effect . '' they would compulsive check their watch not just for the time , but for a wide range of information . in some cases their new gizmo would become such an instinctive part of their life that even when not wearing one they would check their bare wrist . some would feel a phantom buzz , notifying them of an imaginary incoming email . the phantom device effect leads us to ask about just how ingrained in our daily habits these devices might become . recent research has suggested that average smartphone users check their phone 150 times a day , starting just minutes after waking up . we also know this has the effect of extending work into all areas of our lives -- monitoring work emails late into the night or during social or family events . we used to worry that the average american watched television for six hours a day . now we accept as a matter of course the fact that we tied to our devices for most of the time we 're awake . indeed many of us go to bed with our smart devices quietly monitoring our rhythms as we sleep . this raises the question of what impact it will have on our lives . in the work carl __cederström__ and i have done on the hidden dangers of wearables , a big big concern is privacy . the apple watch , like most wearables , is essentially a tracking device , recording heart rate , sleep patterns , movement , whereabouts , and much more depending on the apps installed . all this is packaged and transmitted to __datacentres__ for analysis . the result ? a database of personal information of which the stasi could only have dreamed . as well as sucking up personal information , wearables could fuel an unhealthy obsession with personal wellness . by pumping health and wellbeing information at us non-stop , we start to become a little too focused on our __bio-rhythms__ . data which would have been generated only in the most unusual situations now becomes commonplace , making people not just health conscious , but also __self-obsessed__ . instead of checking in with social networks , we spend more time checking in with our own bodily rhythms . as a result other people start to become more interested in what is going on inside themselves rather than what is happening in the world . as we pay more attention to our feed of personal __biodata__ we 're likely to become more anxious about things that we may never have given a second thought to in the past . not walking your allotted steps in a day or finding you had a poor sleeping pattern at night can become a source of significant personal guilt or worry . as a result , we pour more attention into monitoring and controlling ourselves , giving us less time to do the things which actually make us happy . if apple 's projections are indeed correct and tens of millions of people purchase smartwatches , it 's likely to create a step change in our lives . we already see people routinely posting on social media information they would have only shared with their doctor a few years ago . widespread use of smartwatches could mean that instead of relieving our boredom by answering emails , people will spend their time sifting through their __biodata__ stream , planning ways to maximize their personal wellness ratings . rather than talking about what was on television last night , people will start comparing charts of their sleeping patterns . when this happens we will know that the internet of me has arrived . read : will your apple watch program you ? copyright 2015 the conversation . some rights reserved .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the state department only last month started automatically preserving dozens of high-level officials ' emails , according to a department spokeswoman , a revelation that comes amid the controversy surrounding former secretary of state hillary clinton 's own email use . this is key because clinton , in her news conference on tuesday to answer questions about why she exclusively used a private email address to communicate during her tenure , told reporters she 'd thought her communications to senior department officials were always saved . that 's an important point , given legal requirements for preserving federal records . `` in meeting the record-keeping obligations , it was my practice to email government officials on their state or __dot-gov__ accounts so that the emails were immediately captured and preserved , '' she said . the news about the state department 's __archiving__ practices -- and the change that started in february -- could refuel the furor of republicans over clinton 's choice to not use her government email account , to have a private server in her family home house her emails , and to decide -lrb- with her staff -rrb- which emails to delete and which to turn over to the state department for review . rep. susan brooks , a member of the select committee investigating the 2012 benghazi attack , said in the republicans ' weekly media address saturday , `` you see , right now there is no way for us to know whether we have all of the state department communications that rightfully belong to the american people . '' `` the only way to truly know is by having access to secretary clinton 's personal server , '' the indiana republican added . `` we are asking secretary clinton to turn her server over to a neutral , third-party arbiter . after a complete inventory , this arbiter can make a determination as to which emails should be public and which should remain private . these decisions would be completely impartial and independent . '' so far , brooks ' committee had gotten just under 300 of clinton 's emails from the state department . last year , as it was trying to update its records , the state department asked former secretaries of state for __nonpersonal__ emails from their personal accounts that could be work-related . that request prompted clinton to turn over __30,490__ emails -- about 55,000 pages . clinton has asked for those emails to be made public , and department officials are reviewing them to make sure no sensitive information is released . clinton 's office had said her account contained __62,320__ sent and received emails from march 2009 to february 2013 . `` about half were personal that were not in any way related to work . i had no reason to save them , '' clinton said at her press conference . the fact that all emails from senior officials were n't automatically saved until recently does n't mean they are gone , according to the state department . `` i would n't state it 's lost to history , because there are always -- there are technical means of gaining access to past information , '' spokeswoman jen psaki said friday . at the same time , psaki said the state department chose to change its approach -- by automatically saving all emails -- `` because it 's an imperfect system . '' `` this is a more efficient and better way , '' she said of the new system . `` but , obviously , there were ways to preserve -lrb- emails -rrb- , and employees and individuals were expected to do that prior to this new process . '' separately , psaki said that a letter was recently sent to former state department staffers asking for their help in the preservation effort . `` if they should become aware ... of federal record in their possession -- such as an email sent or received on a personal email account while -lrb- they were -rrb- serving in their official capacity at the department -- that ... record -lrb- should -rrb- be made available to the department , '' psaki said the __ex-staffers__ were told . even before last month 's chance , emails of current secretary of state john kerry , who uses a government address , were already being saved automatically . cnn 's adam levine contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- america may be growing less hateful . that 's according to an annual southern poverty law center report that says the number of hate groups in the united states remains on the decline for the second year in a row . in the `` intelligence report '' released tuesday , the splc says the number of hate groups operating in the u.s. declined 17 % between 2013 and 2014 . they are now at their lowest levels since 2005 , the watchdog organization said . `` patriot groups , which are animated by a series of conspiracy theories about the alleged evils of the federal government , fell even faster , to __874__ groups from a 2012 peak of __1,360__ groups . in just the last year , the number of patriot groups declined by 20 % , from __1,096__ groups to __874__ , '' the report said . `` but those numbers may be somewhat deceiving . more than half of the decline in hate groups was of ku klux klan chapters , and many of those have apparently gone underground , ending public communications , rather than __disbanding__ . '' the decline may be due to a number of factors , including the __rebounding__ economy , law enforcement action and leadership issues within the groups , the splc said . the `` high social '' cost of being associated publicly with a hate group is also noted as a factor for decline , the group said . `` the atmosphere has changed , '' mark potok , editor-in-chief of the `` intelligence report , '' told reporters on a conference call . `` overall , the groups are less important . '' people publishing messages of hate directly to the internet is also cited as a possible reason for the decline in the organized groups . california and florida have the largest number of hate groups , with more than 50 each . alaska and hawaii are the only states with no hate groups , according to the splc . the report tracks the number of chapters or groups , not individual members , so while the number of groups is on the decline , it 's possible that some of the groups that remain have increased membership . the ku klux klan experienced the largest decline of all hate groups , according to the report , losing more than 50 % of its chapters . one of the oldest and most infamous hate groups in the united states , the kkk took its foothold after the civil war , terrorizing the african-american population with intimidation and violent actions , including lynching . the klan 's growth slowed after the establishment of jim crow laws in the american south , according to the splc . the kkk 's last resurgence came during the civil rights movement of the 1960s . the group was again responsible for large-scale terror against the south 's african-american population . in 1990 , the splc started to keep track of the number of kkk chapters , which reached a high of 221 in 2010 , in response to president barack obama 's election , according to the report . since then , the numbers have been on the decline . the splc now reports 72 chapters , down from 163 a year ago . under obama , 4 in 10 say race relations worsened . the reason for the decline of the ku klux klan is not totally clear , though the report even suggests the groups may be going deeper underground . `` it appears that most of the groups simply faded as their leaders and members got older , but it is also very possible that many simply stopped announcing where their chapters were , '' the report said . the center estimates that between 5,000 and 8,000 people are klan members in the united states . opinion : america facing anti-muslim bigotry . the splc report also notes that more people may be operating as so-called lone wolves . the overall number of hate groups peaked in 2011 and has been on the decline since . however , the number of registered users to __stormfront__ -- a website claiming to be `` the voice of the new , embattled white minority ! '' -- has doubled since 2008 . it now has nearly 300,000 users . lone wolves are a concern , the report said , because 90 % of all domestic terror attacks since 2009 were carried out by individuals or pairs . lone wolf planned attack on u.s. capitol , fbi says . the report points to neo-nazi frazier glenn miller , who allegedly killed three people in kansas who he thought were jewish , and an incident in las vegas , where an anti-government couple killed two police officers before being killed themselves , as examples of radical criminal elements acting alone . the splc refers to this and other indicators to say that many individuals may be moving from organized groups to the internet , to become more anonymous . looking towards next year , splc is `` expecting a real wave of islamophobia '' because of the proliferation of isis and the heavy media coverage of the extremist group , potok told reporters .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     media coverage of isis could spur `` real wave of islamophobia , '' report 's editor says . the number of hate groups across the u.s. dropped 17 % from 2013 to 2014 , the report says . in particular , the number of kkk chapters dropped from 163 to 72 in a year , it says .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- police raided millionaire heir robert durst 's home in houston , texas , on tuesday , a day after he was charged with first-degree murder . dick __deguerin__ , durst 's attorney , confirmed that investigators were searching the home . it was not immediately clear what they were looking for inside durst 's __14th-floor__ condo , where he has lived for many years , cnn affiliate ktrk reported . the raid comes days after fbi agents arrested durst in a new orleans hotel . the los angeles county district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against him on monday , accusing durst of shooting and killing his close friend susan berman in december 2000 . if convicted , he could face the death penalty . `` i think it 's ridiculous for them to be making a search 15 years after susan berman was killed , and they 're searching a place in houston , '' __deguerin__ told cnn . durst remains jailed in new orleans , where he 's facing drug and weapons charges stemming from his arrest over the weekend . durst 's alleged connections with berman 's death and two others were the focus of hbo 's true crime documentary , `` the jinx . '' __deguerin__ has claimed it 's no coincidence authorities moved in to arrest durst just as the documentary 's finale was about to air . and on tuesday , he said he was n't surprised about the houston raid either . `` i 'm not surprised they 're acting like a bunch of keystone cops , particularly after being embarrassed by the tv program , '' he said . `` and i 'll be even more surprised if they find anything of any evidentiary value whatsoever .

ARTICEL:     ferguson , missouri -lrb- cnn -rrb- __loistine__ __hoskin__ cared for her old car as a sentimental possession , missing a tire while parked beside her home , until one day the city ticketed her for having a `` derelict vehicle in driveway . '' a tow truck took it away in 2009 . so began an odyssey with ferguson police , municipal court and city hall that left her with $ 1,200 in fines that to this day she still does n't fully understand . she paid the sum because endless court hearings about the car wore her down . `` i do n't have a lawyer . i 'm not a lawyer . it 's me going up against the city of ferguson when the attorneys wo n't help , '' __hoskin__ said this week . she never saw again her 1996 __oldsmobile__ __ninety-eight__ with __168,000__ miles . its location is a mystery . she accepts the loss because at least she 's not in jail , where city authorities threatened to put her at one point , she said . while __hoskin__ 's surrender of both car and $ 1,200 to the city may seem a matter of personal choice , the u.s. justice department revealed this week a `` pattern and practice '' of racial discrimination within ferguson that may lend credibility to __hoskin__ 's account of a government run amok . just about every branch of ferguson government -- police , municipal court , city hall -- participated in `` unlawful '' targeting of african-american residents such as __hoskin__ for tickets and fines , the justice department concluded this week . the millions of dollars in fines and fees paid by black residents served an ultimate goal of satisfying `` revenue rather than public safety needs , '' the justice department found . to the outside world , the federal findings were staggering , but to __hoskin__ and other longtime residents , the conclusion was nothing new . they 've felt it all along , they say . it 's only now that federal authorities have documented the institutionalized racism , as part of a civil rights investigation after a white police officer 's fatal shooting of an unarmed black teen , michael brown , 19 , last summer . the officer , darren wilson , was cleared of federal civil rights violations this week and was earlier cleared of criminal wrongdoing . the justice department is expected to pursue a __court-supervised__ consent decree that requires the city of ferguson to make changes to its police and courts . `` it 's definitely a vicious cycle , '' said __hoskin__ , 64 , a retired airline reservation agent . `` unfortunately for most people who are in this cycle , they continue to be in a downward spiral because they ca n't get jobs , they ca n't do anything , they ca n't pay the fines . '' __hoskin__ 's household has experienced its share of ugly encounters with ferguson police , the family said . __hoskin__ 's daughter was ticketed by police in what she described as racial profiling , she said . in 2007 , kimberly __hoskin__ got a $ 124 ticket for driving her sister 's car , which was n't insured in missouri , and then had to pay an additional $ 100 fine when she missed a court appearance because of an emergency __appendectomy__ . the court , she said , rejected her medical excuse and issued a warrant for her arrest . she paid a total of $ 224 in fines because she was in the middle of a job search and did n't want an outstanding warrant to prevent her from getting a good job . `` why is it that all the people in court are black ? '' kimberly __hoskin__ said of defendants in municipal court . `` i 've had so many police officers make a u-turn , follow me , run my plates , find out everything is ok , then turn around and go back in the direction they were going . `` there 's nothing we can do . in ferguson , the police do what they want to do . ferguson does what it wants , '' said kimberly __hoskin__ , 35 , who now works the overnight shift on a general motors manufacturing line . city officials and police declined to respond to cnn 's requests this week for comment about the __hoskin__ family 's assertions . last september , the city council repealed administrative fees imposed by police when overseeing the release of a towed vehicle , the mayor said . the city also no longer has a specific offense for failing to appear in court , which eliminates certain additional fees and court costs , the mayor said . the justice department 's report details how ferguson operated a vertically integrated system -- from street cop to court clerk to judge to city administration to city council -- to raise revenue for the city budget through increased ticketing and fining . ferguson 's budget increases were so sizable that city officials __exhorted__ police and court staff to levy more and more fines and tickets against violators , who turned out to be largely african-american , the justice department said . the demands for revenue were so intense that the police department had `` little concern with how officers do this , '' even disciplining officers who failed to issue an average of 28 tickets a month , the justice department report said . officers competed `` to see who could issue the largest number of citations during a single stop , '' the justice department said . one apparent winner was an officer who issued 14 tickets at a single encounter , according to the federal investigation report . many police stops of civilians `` have little relation to public safety and a questionable basis in law , '' the report said . ferguson police chief mum on federal report . indeed , ferguson enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that ferguson , population 21,000 , was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in st. louis county by having more than $ 1 million in revenue in 2010 , the report said . when ferguson court revenues exceeded $ 2 million in 2012 , the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email : `` awesome ! thanks ! '' according to the federal report . even municipal judges were pressured to boost revenue . `` the city has made clear to the police chief and the municipal judge that revenue generation must also be a priority in court operations , '' the federal investigation found . the city finance director said in a 2011 report that the municipal judge had been successful since 2003 in increasing court collections , and that internal 2011 city report noted a judge 's statement that `` none of these changes could have taken place without the cooperation of the court clerk , the chief of police , and the prosecutor 's office , '' the justice department investigation found . cash filled the city treasury . by 2013 , revenue from enforcing municipal codes reached $ __2.46__ million , the federal report said . by 2015 , the city anticipated that fines and fees would account for 23 % of the budget , or $ __3.09__ million of $ __13.26__ million in general fund expenses , the justice department found . just five years earlier , court fines and fees made up only 12 % of the budget , or $ __1.38__ million of $ __11.07__ million in general fund revenues , the justice department found . the fines were among the highest of surrounding municipalities . for example , area parking fines ranged from $ 5 to $ 100 , but ferguson 's parking fine was $ 102 . a fine for `` __weeds/tall__ grass '' was $ 5 in one nearby city , but ferguson 's fine ranged from $ 77 to $ 102 , the justice department found . the federal government made a forceful conclusion : . `` city , police and court officials for years have worked in concert to maximize revenue at every stage of the enforcement process , beginning with how fines and fine enforcement processes are established , '' the federal report said . after the justice department 's announcement this week , ferguson mayor james knowles told reporters that he , police chief tom jackson and city attorney stephanie __karr__ met with federal officials about their findings and initiated several initiatives , including reforms to the municipal court . knowles said municipal judges have created a docket for alleged offenders having trouble paying fines . also , a defendant may ask a judge or prosecutor about different payment plans or alternative sentencing , the mayor said . defendants have been required to pay an entire fine at once , regardless of ability to pay , the federal report said . the city also passed an ordinance last september to cap municipal court revenues at 15 % of the city 's overall budget , the mayor said . that figure is half missouri 's legal limit , he added . all the reforms are intended to `` move this city , its residents and our entire community forward , '' the mayor said . back at her home , __loistine__ __hoskin__ recalled the height of absurdity in her fight against the city , which occurred shortly after her husband , calvin , died in 2008 of complications from paralysis he suffered in a car accident three years earlier . she had been his caregiver . she appeared in court to appeal the citation , but an officer arrested her and put her in the back of the squad car . her offense ? failing to appear in court , she said . she spent four hours in jail . she insists she made every court date . for now , she lives in fear of the police , even at home . `` we just got to a point where we said we 're just not going to have anyone over -- because they were fearful when they left they would get some ticket , and they did n't even live here , '' __hoskin__ said . cnn 's ed lavandera and tristan smith contributed from ferguson . michael martinez reported and wrote this story from los angeles .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- a crowd of tens of thousands filled yitzhak __rabin__ square in tel aviv on saturday evening , calling for a change in israeli leadership amid growing discontent with the current administration . the rally , called `` israel wants change , '' was put on by one million hands , a grassroots movement that focuses its efforts on two major issues : a two-state solution and a reduction in the cost of living . on both of these topics , founder __dror__ __ben-ami__ says , prime minister benjamin netanyahu has failed . `` we think that the only way to go forward on that account is to change government and to get this current government out of office . to get bibi out of office , '' says __ben-ami__ . organizers are not promoting any specific candidate or pushing voters toward any political party in the march 17 balloting . instead , they are encouraging voters to change the current administration . police estimated the crowd at 40,000 people . headlining the rally was meir __dagan__ , the former head of mossad , israel 's spy agency , and a vocal critic of netanyahu . in recent weeks , __dagan__ criticized netanyahu 's decision to speak before the u.s. congress , and he continued his criticism at the rally , saying that he has never seen such stagnation in israeli politics . netanyahu still has broad support in israel , and his likud party is doing well in the polls . the zionist union is likud 's primary challenger . in the initial round of polling immediately following netanyahu 's speech before congress , the zionist union was expected to win 24 seats in the knesset while likud was expected to win 23 seats . the poll comes from cnn affiliate channel 2 israel . because of the nature of israeli politics , netanyahu 's likud party could lose the election while netanyahu still becomes prime minister . in many ways , this rally was reminiscent of a similar social movement that began in the summer of 2011 . hundreds of thousands of protesters packed the streets of tel aviv , demanding improvements in the cost of housing , education , and health care . what started as a small social media campaign turned into a nationwide movement that spread to other major cities . this time , the issues are different . but the growing sense of discontent and the calls for change remain .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- we have no problem taking wall street executives to task for decisions that leave american families financially devastated , yet we give silicon valley billionaires a pass when they do the same thing . america needs to realize that instead of creating jobs , silicon valley is erasing them , leaving millennials financially stranded before their careers can get off the ground . silicon valley is tossing millennials aside like yesterday 's laptop . the commonly held belief is that with hard work and a good education , a young person in america can get a good job . but despite falling unemployment , college grads age 22 to 27 are stuck in __low-paying__ jobs that do n't even require a college degree . the percentage of young people languishing in __low-skill__ , __low-paying__ jobs is 44 % , a 20-year high . only 36 % of college grads have jobs that pay at least $ 45,000 , a sharp decline from the 1990s , after adjusting for inflation . perhaps most __depressingly__ , the percentage of young people making below $ 25,000 has topped 20 % , worse than in 1990 . in other words , those with a bachelor 's diploma were better off before the digital revolution . if this comes as a surprise , that 's because images from popular culture push the idea that young college graduates are shrugging off bad employment prospects with their do-it-yourself attitude . in our collective imagination , millennials are saying , `` no jobs ? that 's ok -- i 'll create my own ! '' and then they solve their own problems by heading to silicon valley with little more than an iphone and an idea to create the next hip app that supposedly will turn them into overnight millionaires . a fictional example of this new breed of young idealistic entrepreneur would be mike bean , founder of internet behemoth __gryzzl__ on the show `` parks and recreation . '' played by blake anderson , bean might best be described as `` barefoot and pregnant with ideas . '' the bumbling entrepreneur __conquers__ the world practically by accident , armed only with his digital savvy , a __can-do__ spirit , and a penchant for invading users ' privacy . you get the idea that his success came easily . privacy concerns aside , the mike beans of america are just about as rare as the mark __zuckerbergs__ . in fact , the percentage of people under 30 who own private businesses has reached a 24-year low . garages across the country are not exactly humming with millennials launching tech startups . but wait -- wo n't the digital economy eventually lead to better jobs ? after a period of adjustment , wo n't things get better ? unfortunately that 's not the path we 're on . one of the biggest misconceptions about the digital economy is that for every middle-class job rendered obsolete by technology , there 's a new , equally good -lrb- or better -rrb- job created by silicon valley . but exactly the opposite is happening . the digital economy is __vaporizing__ the good jobs and replacing them with two kinds of jobs : minimum wage jobs -lrb- think amazon warehouse employees -rrb- and so-called `` __sharing-economy__ jobs '' -lrb- think uber drivers -rrb- . the __sharing-economy__ jobs are even worse than minimum wage jobs because they offer no stability or protections for workers . sharing economy jobs are n't really jobs at all ; they 're freelance gigs . sure , silicon valley does n't owe america jobs . but something is wrong with the picture of a handful of tech billionaires overseeing a kingdom of falling wages , decreased worker protection and zero job security . this `` __winner-take-all__ '' digital economy is not sustainable . people on both sides of the political spectrum are worried . liberal __luminary__ robert reich , a professor at the university of california at berkeley and former secretary of labor under bill clinton , calls the sharing economy the `` __share-the-scraps__ '' economy . speaking of tech companies that utilize on-demand labor , such as uber , __instacart__ and __taskrabbit__ , he says , `` the big money goes to the corporations that own the software . the scraps go to the on-demand workers . '' meanwhile , conservative columnist ross __douthat__ fears a dystopian future in which `` a rich , technologically proficient society will no longer offer meaningful occupation to many people of ordinary talents . '' put simply , silicon valley 's utopia is the rest of america 's __dystopia__ . and those who are punished more than anyone else are recent college graduates , whose lifetime earning potential has already suffered an irreversible setback . and if you think your own job is safe , think again . new research predicts that nearly half of all jobs are susceptible to automation over the next two decades . this is a giant leap backward , but it 's deceptively described as technological `` progress . '' as anyone who 's talked to an automated system on the phone lately can attest , `` automated '' usually means `` worse . '' what can be done ? how can we fight this slide back toward the middle ages ? if we take no action , we 're headed toward a kind of digital world __feudalism__ where there are a handful of kings , a lot of peasants and no middle class . there 's no easy fix , but we can do three things immediately . first , we can stop glorifying tech titans and start talking openly about silicon valley 's questionable tactics and its real job creation record -lrb- i.e. , just follow the numbers -rrb- . second , we can encourage more lawsuits against the abusive practices of `` __sharing-economy__ '' powerhouses . third , we can elect leaders who are vocal about holding silicon valley accountable for their power over the entire american workforce , including white-collar employees . the fictional __gryzzl__ 's tagline borrows some millennial slang : `` would n't it be tight if everyone was chill to each other ? '' indeed it would . and if we want a better future for millennials and the generations after them , we need to challenge the prevailing silicon valley ethos before it 's too late .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- former manchester united star danny welbeck returned to haunt his old side to send holders arsenal into the semifinals of the fa cup with a 2-1 victory at old trafford monday . the england striker was surplus to requirements at louis van gaal 's united , but was quick to capitalize on a mistake by antonio valencia to grab the winner just after the hour mark . a disappointing night for united was compounded by a late red card for argentina international angel di maria , who was given his marching orders after __manhandling__ referee michael oliver . di maria was initially booked for simulation and took his protests too far by grabbing the official , which led to his instant dismissal . with 10 men , united was never able to exert any real pressure on arsenal and it took two fine saves david de gea to deny further goals from santi cazorla and alexis sanchez for the away side . victory for arsenal booked a return to wembley for a last four clash with either reading or bradford city , who are __replaying__ their quarterfinal tie next monday . liverpool or blackburn rovers will play aston villa in the other semifinal . arsenal had taken a 25th minute lead through nacho monreal , the spanish defender converting after fine move which involved mesut ozil and alex oxlade-chamberlain . but the advantage was short lived with di maria finding wayne rooney to score with a diving header . united looked to press ahead for the winner , but home hopes were dashed when valencia made a hash of a back pass and welbeck was quick to latch on to the loose ball and beat de gea . ' i believe it was justice for him to score he worked extremely hard today , ' arsenal manager arsene wenger said of welbeck . his counterpart van gaal will now , barring a miracle , be left without a trophy in his first season in charge of the english powerhouses , with the pressure now on to seal a top four place in the epl to guarantee champions league football next season .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- thiago silva 's path to redemption took a mere 12 minutes . for that short period of time the brazilian must have been panicking that his needless error had cost his paris saint-germain side a place in the last eight of the european champions league . his handball had gifted english premier league leaders chelsea a 2-1 aggregate advantage in extra time , but this was one tale that would be adorned with a silva lining . seconds after being denied by a world class save from thibaut courtois , silva looped a header into the net to send psg through on away goals . not only did he save himself from a barrage of criticism , he also got colleague zlatan ibrahimovic out of jail too . the maverick swedish striker 's dismissal after 31 minutes made psg 's passage into the quarterfinals all the more remarkable , as it battled the best team in england with 10 men for an __energy-sapping__ 90 minutes . gary cahill looked to have ended psg 's resistance with a 81st minute goal before former chelsea defender david luiz equalized with four minutes left . eden hazard converted from the spot in extra time after silva 's misdemeanor before the 30-year-old popped up at the death to make amends and avenge psg 's defeat at the same stage by chelsea last season . `` we played a great game , '' luiz told sky sports . `` it was amazing tonight , the spirit , the players gave everything . when we lost __ibra__ we said we had to keep it simple and keep the ball . `` it 's amazing for the club and the city . we tried to win the game even with one less man . we have a long way to go to win the champions league and we keep our feet on the floor . '' the first tie ended 1-1 in paris three weeks ago but most of the headlines related to an ugly incident of racism on the city 's metro system . a group of supporters , apparently chelsea fans , were caught on camera appearing to prevent a black man from boarding a train before chanting : `` we 're racist and that 's the way we like it . '' the uk 's metropolitan police announced on wednesday that it had summoned five men to appear in court later in march , while chelsea has vowed to ban for life any of its fans that are found guilty . the club extended an invitation to the man who was the the subject of the abuse , known as souleymane s , but the 33-year-old refused . the opening stages were tense and feisty , just as they were in the french capital during the first leg , but the match in london ignited after a flashpoint just past the half hour mark . ibrahimovic , so often the hero for psg , turned villain after being dismissed for a forceful tackle on chelsea 's brazilian playmaker oscar . the home side surrounded referee bjorn __kuipers__ who duly produced a red card -- the fourth of the swede 's often controversial career in the champions league . but replays suggested the 33-year-old was perhaps unfortunate to see red , having tried to pull out of the tackle at the last second . despite having a man advantage , chelsea struggled to create clear cut openings as psg defended resolutely . __kuipers__ was in the spotlight again as the half came to a close -- a __mazy__ run from striker diego costa ended when he was felled by psg 's uruguayan forward edinson cavani . the referee took a long look at the incident but decided to wave play on , much to the chagrin of chelsea 's players and manager jose mourinho . mourinho 's travails continued after the break as the blues toiled in its attempts to open up a determined psg rearguard . a half chance for gary cahill came and went before the visitors came to the fore . first cavani played in maxwell , whose ball across the face of goal was begging to be tapped in , before the uruguayan had a chance to tilt the tie firmly in his side 's favor . played in on goal by argentinian javier pastore , cavani rounded chelsea goalkeeper thibaut courtois but could only glance a shot off the near post from a tight angle . pastore then got into the area after neat approach play and , though he got a powerful low shot away , courtois was equal to it and __palmed__ it clear . chelsea began to reassert its dominance as psg tired . substitute ramires weaved into the area and was denied by a fine save at his near post by salvatore sirigu . from the resulting corner a __miskick__ from costa presented the ball at the feet of england defender cahill , who lashed home from 12 yards out . but chelsea were unable to hold out . luiz , who won the champions league with chelsea during a three-year stint at the club , had been booed throughout the game for a running battle with costa . and he rose highest to power a header into the net and make the tie level on aggregate with just four minutes remaining . psg began the extra half hour in sluggish fashion and were punished when silva needlessly handled a looping cross into the area as he went up to challenge substitute kurt zouma for the ball . belgium international eden hazard duly tucked the penalty away , to restore chelsea 's lead and ensure the tie would not go to penalties . still chelsea looked edgy . courtois was forced to make a world class save from silva , as the brazilian desperately tried to make amends for his handball . but despite that warning , silva netted with a fine header from the very next corner , looping a brilliant header over the goalkeeper from 14 yards out . after the game mourinho admitted psg had `` clearly '' been the better side : `` our performance was not good enough , '' he told sky sports . `` we had the game in our hands twice but i think psg were stronger than us and coped better with the pressure of the game . '' german champions bayern munich cemented its place in the last eight with a comprehensive 7-0 dismantling of shakhtar donetsk . after a 0-0 draw in the first leg in ukraine , shakhtar 's task became an uphill one inside four minutes when __olexandr__ __kucher__ was dismissed for bringing down mario __götze__ inside the penalty area . thomas muller tucked home the resulting penalty , and bayern subsequently laid siege to shakhtar 's goal . robert lewandowski nodded rafinha 's cross against the post before pep guardiola 's side doubled its advantage just after the half hour mark . defender jerome boateng had the simple task of tapping home from point blank range after former dortmund striker lewandowski 's effort had been saved . bayern ran riot after the break , france international franck ribery grabbing the third with a fine low finish after a powerful run into the area . muller grabbed a second moments later before holger __badstuber__ made it five with a thumping header . lewandowski finally got on the score sheet before __götze__ completed the rout .

'' the joint typhoon warning center in pearl harbor , hawaii , said the cyclone had weakened from the equivalent of a category 5 hurricane to a category 4 . it has dumped more than 9 inches of rain on the capital in a __36-hour__ period and has wind gusts of up to 190 mph -lrb- 305 kph -rrb- . track the storm . pam is forecast to move __southeastward__ along the western edge of the southern islands of __vanuatu__ . it is n't expected to make any additional __landfalls__ before __dissipating__ . it will continue to weaken as it crosses cooler waters and encounters higher wind shear . pam is expected to pass east of new zealand on sunday and into monday . it could bring heavy rainfall to north island , including auckland . the capital , the biggest city in the __vanuatu__ island chain , sits on the coastline , which is vulnerable to storm surges during powerful cyclones . tropical cyclone pam is the strongest storm to make landfall since the devastating super typhoon haiyan hit the philippines in 2013 . chloe morrison , an emergency communications director for the humanitarian organization world vision , told cnn that she could see some light between her boarded-up windows but it was still hard to see the totality of the destruction outside the house where she and seven others huddled in a back room during the storm . `` seven hours hunkered down and it 's still not safe to go outside , '' she said . `` the winds are still really howling . we 're really lucky to be in a concrete house . '' part of the tin roof twisted off the house and landed by one of the windows , she said . she also noted that two trees outside did n't get uprooted , but they had not one bit of fruit or any leaves remaining . despite the `` quite terrifying ordeal , '' morrison said , their house did n't have any damage . through the night , the wind and torrential rain made it sound like an angry ocean was just outside their doors , she said . world vision , which says it 's been based in __vanuatu__ for more than 30 years , said its emergency assessment team would head out to view the damage when it is safe . the staff helped prepare communities on the islands for the cyclone by positioning water , food , blankets , __tarpaulins__ , and shelter , hygiene and kitchen kits in key places , it said , as well as advising on disaster preparedness . residents have been advised to seek shelter in places such as churches , universities and schools . `` the strongest thing they 've got is cement churches , '' said __inga__ __mepham__ , program director for care international for the __vanuatu__ program . `` some of them do n't have that . it 's hard to find a structure that you 'd think would be able to withstand a category 5 -lrb- storm -rrb- . '' earlier , photographer michael mclennan -- who said the storm is being called the `` __vanuatu__ monster '' -- told cnn that the `` strength of winds is incredible . '' video footage he shot earlier friday showed palm trees being whipped by wind and rain . evacuation alerts have been issued for several parts of the country . even before the sun rose saturday , __vanuatu__ was already getting hit hard , with most communication and power cut off due to the storm . `` the wind outside is terrifying , '' michael wolfe , world vision 's national director in __vanuatu__ , told that organization . `` i ca n't imagine what it 's like for families out there who were n't able to find safe shelter before the storm . '' the archipelago nation northeast of australia contains 83 small islands , many of which have little infrastructure and lack the strong housing structures that can endure a __walloping__ storm . because of the tropical climate in __vanuatu__ , some of the housing is made of lighter building materials , including straw and corrugated metals . residents prepared for the storm , boarding up windows and chopping down trees that stand close to buildings in case they could become debris or cause further damage or injury . cnn host bill weir , who was recently in __vanuatu__ on assignment , said that while port vila has some modern development in the form of an airport , large hotels and a convention center that 's under construction , life on some of the islands has remained almost unchanged for thousands of years . `` for search and rescue , for bringing food and supplies and medicine , it 's extremely challenging , '' he said . pam has triggered watches and warnings in the solomon islands and new zealand . cnn 's greg botelho and derek van dam contributed to this report .

'' of course , the leg irons could have been used on a federal sailor or soldier taken captive . but that did n't occur with the confederate __ironclad__ . it was scuttled in december 1864 , having never fired a shot in anger while it defended the city . about 400 artifacts have been brought up by divers in the initial stage of the recovery of the __css__ georgia , which must be moved for a deepening of the shipping channel . `` we have scratched the surface as far as the artifacts are concerned . there are a lot more to come up , '' __jobling__ told cnn on thursday . texas a&m is working with the u.s. army corps of engineers in savannah to conserve many of the artifacts for eventual display . archaeology is n't just about cool artifacts . it 's about making a connection with the humans that used these items . and while experts have n't gleaned much about the daily life of the crew from the early dives , they have found some items that would have been used by an individual : an __ironstone__ plate commonly used in the south , a __musket__ trigger guard and the butt stock of a gun . visibility at the site is practically nonexistent . divers have to depend on feel to locate and remove smaller items . much of it is is __detritus__ of the wreck : small iron plates , nails and spikes . among the items __cataloged__ since the dives formally began at the end of january are two pieces that helped with the business end of the __css__ georgia : its cannons . four of the artillery pieces are amid the wreckage about 40 feet down on the floor of the savannah river . one iron piece had eyes , or holes , that connected a gun carriage to ropes that the __ironclad__ 's crew manipulated to move the gun forward and backward . another piece , a __trunnion__ cap , helped hold the cannon to the carriage . divers and archaeologists are following a timetable and grid in the recovery , with smaller items being brought up by hand . a previous salvage effort and damage from dredging displaced some of the artifacts . other items remain right where they fell . `` someone __undid__ the engine , moved it and was dropped '' into the depths , said __jobling__ . contract divers are out on the site every day , weather permitting , not more than a couple miles east of the city 's famous river street and waterfront . the $ 15 million removal of the __css__ georgia is necessary for the state and federal harbor deepening project , which will see the channel go from 42 to a uniform 47 feet so massive cargo container ships can use the port without relying on the tide . in june or july , u.s. navy divers are expected be on site , to bring up the larger pieces : two engines , the propeller , a steam __condenser__ , the four guns and the __casemates__ that housed them . one of the __casemates__ is large : 68 feet by 24 feet . four artillery shells will be recovered , with the u.s. marine corps to render them safe for museum display . the wooden lower hull no longer exists . the __css__ georgia did n't have enough power to maneuver and effectively trade artillery rounds with any enemy vessels that might approach from the atlantic ocean . instead , the vessel became a stationary floating battery , bristling with artillery pieces . the yankees refused to take on the __css__ georgia or other nearby defense __obstructions__ . archaeologists have the challenge of preserving portions of the __css__ georgia through chemical and other means , making her iron stable so the remains one day can be displayed . conservation of selected artifacts and parts will be done at texas a&m and will take about two years to complete . state and local officials hope __conserved__ pieces will be exhibited somewhere in the city . much of the __css__ georgia is corroded , and archaeologists are __gauging__ the integrity of each piece for conservation . but many pieces remain in pretty good shape . an x-ray of one of the leg irons shows a fair bit of corrosion . experts will inject __epoxy__ to fill those gaps and remove any __concretion__ on the iron , said __jobling__ . officials need more artifacts and investigation to tell the story of the crew . `` hopefully , there is a section of the wreck that will tell the human side of the __css__ georgia , '' said __jobling__ . while salvage operations soon after the civil war removed a lot of iron from the site , there 's a chance personal items survive , especially if they are below the sediment line and protected from the ravages of oxygen . interestingly , the vessel 's crew had to run the main engine constantly , just to keep it afloat . why ? that 's because the __css__ georgia 's green wood made it susceptible to leaks . so on december 21 , 1864 , just as union maj. gen. william t. sherman 's hordes of soldiers reached savannah , the __ironclad__ 's crew likely opened its water valves . the __css__ georgia silently slipped below the surface . the sailors used small boats to get to shore and began a __20-mile__ walk from savannah . `` they took what they could carry with them , '' __jobling__ said .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- vigilante motorists in new zealand have taken to snatching the car keys of foreign drivers amid rising concern over dangerous driving by tourists . new zealand media have reported five cases this year of locals forcibly taking the keys of foreign motorists after witnessing driving that concerned them . all the incidents -- which have been condemned by authorities -- took place in the south island , which draws tourists from around the world for its rugged scenery , including lakes and mountains featured in director peter jackson 's `` lord of the rings '' films . the incidents occurred amid heightened public concern over tourist driving standards , with eight people killed in crashes involving foreign drivers in the space of a fortnight last month . among the dead were a family of four from hong kong who were killed when their car crossed the center line and collided with a logging truck . the key __snatchings__ have even prompted prime minister john key to weigh in on the issue , advising that `` people taking the law into their own hands is not sensible . '' new zealand police assistant commissioner of road policing dave cliff said the __confiscations__ existed in a legal gray area , as there was no explicit statute dealing with the issue . although there might be exceptional circumstances where taking someone 's keys could be legally justified , such as preventing drunken driving , he said , `` in the vast majority of cases , it wo n't be . '' `` that extends to physically assaulting or abusing someone in response to their driving , which is simply not acceptable , and anyone found doing so should expect to face the consequences , '' he said . diesel mechanic robert __penman__ of dunedin made headlines last month after he took the keys of a chinese couple who had stopped their car on a narrow __single-lane__ road to take pictures , causing a backlog of vehicles behind them . `` i was coming into town with my wife and son and came around the corner , and there was a car stopped in the middle of the road , '' he told cnn affiliate __tvnz__ . he called police and took their keys as `` a safety thing , you know , timeframe for police to get there , '' he said . the new zealand transport agency later revealed that __penman__ was driving on an expired license himself . __penman__ told local media it was not the first time he had taken a tourist 's car keys . only 6 % of crashes in new zealand involve foreign drivers , according to the latest figures provided by the ministry of transport . but in some remote regions of the south island particularly popular with tourists for their scenery -- such as the mackenzie , __southland__ , __queenstown-lakes__ and __kaikoura__ districts -- foreign drivers are involved in about a quarter of all crashes . in __westland__ district , on the south island 's rugged west coast , foreign drivers are involved in 37 % of road crashes resulting in death or injury . tony __kokshoorn__ , mayor of the neighboring grey district , said tourist driving behavior was a major problem in the region and attributed the issue to tourists from countries that drive on the right . new zealanders drive on the left . `` there 's a huge number of tourists coming through to these destinations because of the scenery , but the scenery is a problem , '' he said . `` there 's so many beautiful sights to see that they 're not concentrating on their driving . once they lose their concentration , they tend to fall into old habits and drive on the right . even for 20 seconds , it can cause damage . '' a ministry of transport spokesperson said that while this was a factor , figures showed that australian and british drivers were involved in the most crashes overall , `` so __unfamiliarity__ with which side of the road to drive on is not the only factor . '' __kokshoorn__ said that he had seen three cases of tourists driving on the wrong side of the road recently but that the vigilante approach -- which had seen a visitor to his town punched in the face as he was stripped of his keys last month -- was `` disgraceful . '' he said the best approach was better education on local driving conditions for foreign drivers , particularly at the rental companies where they picked up their vehicles . anyone with a foreign drivers license or permit is able to drive in new zealand for up to a year . associate transport minister craig __foss__ said the government recognized that `` many people are concerned with poor driving behavior on challenging roads in and around popular tourist destinations '' and had established a project in response . the measures include improvements to __roading__ , such as `` keep left '' signage and __no-passing__ markings on the extensive stretches of __single-lane__ highway , and educational resources targeted at visiting drivers , including many targeting the growing chinese market . __kokshoorn__ said it was important to `` strike the right balance '' in getting the message to foreign drivers to take care on the unfamiliar roads . `` we value tourism and the dollars it brings to new zealand , especially to our region here . we do n't want to put tourists off , but we want them to be safe in our country , '' he said . `` you cross that center line , and anything 's possible . '' cnn 's david __molko__ contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- are the upcoming elections in israel crucial ? will the results -- a fourth term for prime minister benjamin netanyahu or a first for opposition leader isaac herzog -- change israel 's policy in a significant way ? as israelis prepare to go to the polls , the answer seems to be negative . many observers in europe and the united states seem to be under the impression that during netanyahu 's time in power , israel was hijacked by right wing __zealots__ -- and that herzog , leader of the zionist union opposition party , is the man who will save the country and return it to the path of sanity . but the fact is that when it comes to the most crucial question regarding the future of israel and the middle east -- what to do about the palestinians -- the difference between the two candidates is negligible , a __divergence__ that is short on substance but long on style and rhetoric . while netanyahu 's insistence on israel 's continued ruling over millions of palestinians is expressed in aggressive , often religious and nationalistic language , herzog 's justifications for doing the same thing would sound much softer and easier to digest in the western world . but at the end of the day , neither netanyahu nor herzog have any real intention to put an end to the occupation of the palestinian territories . netanyahu says it clearly and openly ; herzog and his coalition partners only hint at it . read more : 5 key issues for next israeli leader . this whitewash has been so evident throughout the entire election campaign that a foreigner arriving in israel would have had a hard time understanding anything about what is really going on here . the main issues that have been discussed during the campaign are economic ones -- cost of living , housing prices , government oversight -- but even then , slogans and populist promises have largely replaced the in-depth debates we should be having . but the topics that seem to have consumed most of the headlines range from pure gossip to scandals , some of them concerning the behavior of netanyahu and his wife sara . there was the `` __bottlegate__ '' affair -- claims that the wife of the prime minister had pocketed cash from bottle recycling at their official residence . the __netanyahus__ say they reimbursed the government . israel is a country that is still looking for its way forward ; one that lacks internationally recognized borders ; one that has not yet decided whether it is a western society or a middle eastern one ; one that can not decide whether it wants to be religious or secular , jewish or __bi-national__ . all of these critical issues -- none of them decided on -- have been cast aside , ignored , covered up or denied by a country that has __busied__ itself with the important business of recycled bottles at the prime minister 's residence . there is a big elephant in the room , but israel is turning its back to it . there is a big elephant in the room , but israel believes that if nobody talks about it , the elephant does not exist . this elephant is absent from the israeli discourse on a day-to-day basis , and it is absent during elections -- a time when public discourse should be only be focused on what really matters . the elephant in the israeli room is the unending occupation of palestinian territories , and nobody is talking about it . most of the parties running in the elections have not even bothered to try to answer questions about what their plans are for the palestinians . but the occupation also continues to be a __non-issue__ for too many ordinary israelis , who know very little -- and care even less -- about the cruel reality for the millions of palestinians who live without civil rights in the west bank and who are kept under siege in gaza . for those who regard herzog and the center-left as the great hope of this campaign , it is important to remember that it was the israeli labor party who established the occupation and settlement projects in palestinian territory . __golda__ meir , moshe __dayan__ , shimon peres , yitzhak __rabin__ : those labor leaders , so beloved by the west , are the founding fathers of the most significant venture of modern israel -- the illegal transfer of a jewish population to stolen land . it was a project whose purpose was to prevent any kind of equal division of the land , or a settlement with the palestinians -- and as such it has been a great success story . labor never had a real plan for the palestinians , except to time and again renew the endless peace process , which may be the longest in history . this is still true now , on the eve of elections that stand a real chance of bringing the zionist union to power . the more than 500,000 settlers in the west bank and east jerusalem have created what may be an irreversible reality , but herzog 's only answer to it is to get back to the negotiation table . in private circles he mentions five years as the time he needs to conclude the process . there is no better indication that herzog has no intention of ending the occupation any time soon . numerous peace plans have already been worked out in great detail ; all that is needed is for one courageous israeli leader to implement any one of them . herzog , at least at this stage , does not seem to be the one capable of doing this . on tuesday the `` only democracy in the middle east '' will elect a new parliament and a new government , in what is frequently described as a celebration of `` people power . '' but the reality is that here in israel , it is only the masters who will vote and decide on the future -- not only for themselves , but for the millions of palestinians who have for nearly half a century been living under their control , directly in the west bank and indirectly in gaza . and yet , it seems , their fate is not a topic worthy of discussion . to call this a democracy in 2015 is rather problematic .

ARTICEL:     boston -lrb- cnn -rrb- eight minutes of sheer terror . that 's what police officers from watertown , massachusetts , described in heart-stopping detail monday , revealing details of a chaotic shootout with the boston marathon bombing suspects . one of the suspects , tamerlan tsarnaev , died from injuries he sustained that day -- wounded in a gun battle , then run over by his brother , dzhokhar . dzhokhar tsarnaev managed to escape , but was later caught by police . now he 's on trial , facing 30 charges for the marathon bombings , which killed three people and injured more than 260 others . the shootout with police in the early morning hours of april 19 , 2013 , marked one of the most dramatic chapters in the manhunt for the suspects who paralyzed the boston metropolitan area for days . it started , patrolman joseph reynolds testified , soon after he locked eyes with tamerlan tsarnaev , who he spotted driving an suv that matched a description of a stolen vehicle . reynolds called for backup . it was n't long before tamerlan and dzhokhar tsarnaev were firing guns , throwing bombs and trying to run officers over with a stolen suv , reynolds said . `` tamerlan tsarnaev got out of the driver 's side door and began shooting at my cruiser , '' reynolds said . soon , the officer said he ran out of bullets . sgt. jeffrey __pugliese__ saw what looked like muzzle flashes as soon as he arrived at the scene . `` i put my vehicle in park , i took a round through the windshield , i was sprayed with glass and i knew , ok , we were being fired on , '' said sgt. john __maclellan__ . then the two brothers began throwing improvised explosives , including pipe bombs and a pressure cooker bomb , the officers testified . `` i noticed one was bigger than the other , and they had different styles when they were throwing the devices , '' __maclellan__ said . `` one was throwing like a baseball . '' __maclellan__ said the pressure cooker bomb `` was incredibly loud . i had to holster my weapon . my eyes were shaking violently in my head . i could n't see . '' __pugliese__ said he opened fire when he saw one of the men , tamerlan tsarnaev , charging toward him . __pugliese__ fired and the man threw his pistol at the officer , hitting him in the bicep . __pugliese__ tackled him . and with tamerlan tsarnaev , who was wounded from gunfire , on the ground , the three officers tried to put him in handcuffs . they thought they 'd be able to arrest him . but then something changed . `` we were wrestling with tamerlan , and all of a sudden i could hear an engine revving , '' reynolds said . the suv , reynolds said , was heading straight toward the officers . the dramatic descriptions of the shootout monday sounded like a scene from a hollywood film , said boston globe columnist kevin cullen . but the most extraordinary revelation in court , he said , was that the night could have ended very differently . `` dzhokhar tsarnaev did not have to go back and run his brother over . he actually did a three-point turn and reversed the vehicle . he could have sped off and run away , '' cullen told cnn 's `` the lead with jake tapper . '' he was in a much better position to flee . but apparently he decided to do a u-turn and come back . '' the sight of the stolen suv speeding toward them caught the officers by surprise . `` i reached down and i grabbed tamerlan by the back of the belt and tried to drag him out of the street so he would n't be hit , '' __pugliese__ said . `` the black suv , it was right in my face . ... i kind of laid back and felt the wind from the vehicle as it went by . '' but they did n't move tamerlan in time . his body became hung up in the rear wheels and he was dragged a short distance , __pugliese__ said . the prosecutor asked __pugliese__ if there was something in the road that forced the suv driver to go directly at the officers . `` no , '' he said . `` it was accelerating at a very high rate of speed . '' later that day , tamerlan tsarnaev was pronounced dead at a local hospital , with the cause listed as `` traumatic injuries '' to the head and torso . his fingerprints led to the identification of the suspects . officers discovered that richard donohue , a massachusetts bay transportation authority officer , had been hit by friendly fire during the shootout . he survived , but nearly bled to death . dzhokhar tsarnaev was arrested about 8:45 p.m. that same day , hiding in a boat called the `` slip away '' that was stowed in a backyard in watertown . jurors saw photos of the boat last week . but on monday , they got a chance to see the boat , which has become a key piece of evidence in the trial , in person . before the trial started , prosecutors and defense attorneys had sparred over how much of the boat jurors would get to see . the prosecution sought to remove a panel on which tsarnaev allegedly scrawled incriminating messages so that jurors could see it with their own eyes . defense attorney david bruck argued that cutting out a panel would take the written words out of context and would n't fairly reflect tsarnaev 's state of mind . in south boston , about a mile from the courthouse , jurors intently looked at the entire boat monday . it had been loaded onto a semi truck and moved to the location for viewing by the jury . dzhokhar tsarnaev , wearing a dark jacket and no handcuffs or shackles , watched the jurors but showed little emotion or expression . jurors appeared to strain to make out the words tsarnaev scrawled inside the boat . the boat was riddled with more than 100 bullet holes -- some of which punctured tsarnaev 's words . aaron cooper reported from boston . catherine e. shoichet and ralph ellis wrote the story in atlanta . cnn 's jake tapper and ann o'neill contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     aberdeenshire , scotland -lrb- cnn -rrb- the scottish highlands on a wintry morning in january made for an awe-inspiring interview setting . we traveled along narrow roads winding among snow-capped mountains , eventually arriving at __birkhall__ -- the scottish home to prince charles and his wife , camilla , duchess of cornwall . i had pitched for interviews with the couple several times over the years and finally prince charles accepted . i wanted to speak to them about their 10 years of marriage and their upcoming u.s. tour . the couple 's first tour as newlyweds was also to the united states , so it felt like an appropriate moment to take stock . when you reach the house , it strikes you as an idyllic royal hideaway . it has the sense of a castle but is welcoming like a farmhouse . it has a __pinkish__ hue and green window frames that take in the stunning views . we went in the back entrance and were escorted through the house to the dining room at the front where we set things up . rarely have cameras been allowed in , and never to this part of the house . as we were getting ready , an aide announced someone wanted to say hello . the duchess of cornwall appeared from around the corner , keen to welcome the crew . we spoke about what all brits talk about -- the weather . prince charles opens up about love and life . she is not what you might expect when you meet her . she 's more charismatic , which is something i hope comes across in the cnn special , `` spotlight : charles and camilla . '' unfortunately she had declined our request to be interviewed . she 's never done one and does n't plan to . she wants the limelight to be on her husband . the duchess of cornwall had however allowed our cameras to get close enough to pick up sound during some of her public appearances . that would give viewers a greater sense of her character than they had had before . when prince charles arrived , he also insisted on meeting the crew , which was great but was also eating into our interview time . in the end , we had the full 20 minutes as planned . you can make your own judgements of the tv special , but i think we did manage to give you a good sense of him . he was comfortable enough to be himself . he was the same person on camera as off . afterward , we walked through the house and into the garden for some additional shots . the duchess of cornwall joined us on the way and was worried i would be cold without a coat , but the coat was inaccessible and i did n't want to hold things up . you ca n't tell an awful lot about someone by spending just a morning with them , particularly as a journalist , but my impression was that they are close , connected and have fun . i then left them to take a stroll on their own with the crew , who captured some shots that i think have a small place in royal history -- a glimpse of a couple enjoying each other 's company in their private wilderness , before he __ascends__ to the throne .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- just when you did n't think republicans could top themselves in finding ways to disrespect the president of the united states , on monday , 47 republican senators -- that is , all but seven -- sent a letter to iran that appeared aimed at __scuttling__ president obama 's diplomatic efforts to prevent tehran developing nuclear weapons capacity . the move comes on the heels of house republicans inviting israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to address congress -- without even informing the white house of the plan to issue an invitation . but this latest measure went a step further , seeing republicans in congress literally stepping on the constitutional toes of the executive branch and formally __intruding__ on u.s. diplomacy . under the logan act passed by congress way back in __1799__ , u.s. citizens are prevented from influencing `` disputes or controversies '' involving the united states and a foreign government , without express authority to do so . now , it appears the iran letter was carefully drafted by sen. tom cotton , a smart constitutional lawyer , to come as close as possible to the line of legality without crossing it , specifically by not explicitly taking a position against the iran negotiations . yet the intent to interfere with the executive branch is clear . it 's one thing for congress to demand it ratify such a deal -lrb- as democrats did in 2002 when president bush negotiated arms reductions with russian president vladimir putin -rrb- . but it 's something else entirely to undermine the authority of the white house by sending a partisan letter to a foreign government -lrb- something democrats did n't do with russia -rrb- . sadly , this is only the most recent and extreme example of __dishonor__ and disrespect . in the washington post , columnist jonathan __capehart__ recently outlines what he sees as the top six instances of disrespect toward president obama . his list includes the example of former new york mayor rudy giuliani saying , `` i do not believe that the president loves america . '' also on __capehart__ 's list are the time a reporter from the conservative daily caller website interrupted the president during remarks at the white house about immigration reform in 2012 , and the time south carolina congressman joe wilson , a republican , heckled the president during his speech to a joint session of congress about health care reform . -lrb- wilson shouted `` you lie ! '' in response to remarks by the president that , it should be noted , were in fact quite true -rrb- . and there are plenty more examples of republican __slights__ against president obama . most famously , there was the widespread questioning of obama 's citizenship and academic credentials that included signs at conservative rallies describing obama as a `` __lyin__ ' african . '' and there was the republican women 's group that created an image of `` food stamp dollars '' with obama 's face on them -lrb- as well as a bucket of kfc and watermelon -rrb- . there was also republican presidential candidate and former speaker of the house newt gingrich decrying obama 's `` kenyan , __anti-colonial__ behavior . '' plus there was __then-arizona__ gov. jan brewer waving her finger at president obama when she greeted air force one on the tarmac . brewer later alleged she `` felt a little bit threatened '' by the president . taken as a whole , this list suggests a troubling pattern of profound disrespect for the president . but more than this , it seems to reflect an anti-obama fever that has gripped the republican party -- one that the letter to iran suggests shows no signs of breaking , and is a sure sign of sickness in the republican party . is the lack of respect being shown toward president obama about race , as some have suggested ? yes and no . certainly , for a segment of the country , it really is about being uncomfortable with a black president . indeed , even former secretary of state colin powell , a republican , noted what he described as a `` dark vein '' of intolerance in the party and parts of the country in general . but beyond that hopefully shrinking share of the population that is explicitly racist , there is a far wider issue of implicit racial bias -- an unconscious , yet nonetheless real tendency , to subject president obama to extra scrutiny because of the color of his skin . none of this is to suggest that all of the criticism aimed at president obama stems from implicit racial bias . but such bias appears to be a factor in the ease and __extremity__ of disrespect aimed at america 's first black president . and this disrespect mirrors the disrespect shown against black americans in general . `` honorable people can disagree over policy , '' vice president joe biden said in a statement tuesday . yes , and they should do so honorably . whatever republicans ' gripes about president obama 's vision and leadership , the party and its followers are too often expressing their critiques in an ugly way . and that rampant pattern of disrespect -- for any fellow human being , let alone the president of the united states of america -- is what truly undermines the principles and values of our nation .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- empathy . confidence . passion . these are the traits the next police chief in ferguson , missouri , will need to shrink the ocean of distrust between community and police . so says cecil smith . and maybe he should know . smith is the police chief in sanford , florida , another community rocked by racial tensions and poor __police-community__ relations after the high-profile shooting of a black teenager -- the 2012 death of trayvon martin . and if smith 's experience is any guide , it will take `` a lot of prayer and a little goading '' to convince someone to step into the job vacated this week by chief thomas jackson . `` that community , as we see , has been hurting and struggling for some time now , '' he says . and how : . -- the community remains deeply scarred by the events last year , after the august shooting death of unarmed african-american teenager michael brown by a white ferguson officer darren wilson , and the november decision by the st. louis county grand jury not to charge wilson , who later resigned . occasionally violent protests and sometimes heavy-handed responses by police deepened divisions and distrust . -- the police department was already groaning under the epic weight of months of nearly constant protest and last week 's release of a damning department of justice report that found evidence of discriminatory conduct on the part of ferguson officials . -- add to that the obvious fears facing officers following the shooting early thursday of two police officers only hours after jackson resigned . the decision for jackson to step aside was a mutual one between the chief and city , mayor james knowles told reporters . he 'll get severance and a year of health insurance and will turn the reins over to ferguson police lt. col al __eickhoff__ next week . the city will launch a nationwide search for a permanent replacement , knowles said . `` the city of ferguson looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity . we are committed to keeping our police department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness , '' said knowles -- who has himself been targeted by protesters demanding he resign . to get there , it might look to sanford for guidance . there , trust in the police department __bottomed__ out in the aftermath of the trayvon martin shooting . while no police officers were involved in the shooting , anger over their perceived failure to arrest the teenager 's killer , george zimmerman , pushed relations in the community to a boiling point , eventually resulting in the firing of chief bill lee . zimmerman eventually was arrested , and a jury acquitted him . smith watched the chaos play out from elgin , illinois , where he was deputy police chief . a former boss in illinois suggested he look at the job , so he traveled to florida on his own time , getting to know the community and learning what divided residents and police . he still is n't sure how to explain why he took the job . `` the first year , i was still wondering , was it a smart move ? '' smith joked . but things are better now , he says . after taking the job , smith made it a point of spending time `` walking and talking '' in sanford , building relationships with community leaders and everyday residents . inside the department , stepped up training in engagement and ethical policing . he also stepped up recruitment of african-american officers . `` one of the things that 's going on is we do n't have people who look like us in the community , '' said smith , himself an african-american . he handed out __long-delayed__ promotions . and he even presided over a makeover , enlisting officers to help choose new uniforms . the new chief in ferguson will likely need to do some of the same things , smith says . community leaders and other officials agree . `` we need to deal with the culture issue here to make sure whoever is coming in behind chief jackson is not a new face and a new name on the same type of issues , '' patricia bynes , a democratic __committeewoman__ for ferguson township , '' told cnn wednesday . `` we need to seriously deal with the culture of the police department and the municipal courts and the way the city is run . '' new york police commissioner william bratton said there are two issues confronting the heads of police forces . there is the lack of trust on the community 's part and the lack of confidence some officers have in their leadership . on the first issue , he said : `` you need to be willing to embrace that there is a need to change . '' to police leadership consultant john __vanek__ , whoever takes over the ferguson department will need to have the same leadership traits valued in boardrooms across the world -- the ability to form partnerships across organizational lines , to think differently , to turn failure into success and to do it all in a harsh media spotlight . but that 's easier said than done . `` there 's going to be a lot of hostility in ferguson for a long time , '' he said . so will the new chief need to be african-american to help defuse the racial tensions roiling the city ? here 's the __politic__ answer : find the right candidate , regardless of race . `` you want to find the best candidate to be police chief , '' said attorney benjamin crump , who has represented the families of both trayvon martin and michael brown . `` but diversity is very important . it 's very important that the police officers understand the communities , at least want to engage with members of the community they are going to be protecting and serving . '' `` there 's an old saying in the black community that everybody else is protected and served but we are policed , '' crump said . `` we do n't want to be policed . we want to be protected and served as any american citizen . '' cnn 's nick valencia contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- university of virginia student leaders have scheduled a campus forum with police friday to discuss allegations of brutality following the bloody arrest of a 20-year-old student that prompted protests at uva . the incident early wednesday involved uniformed alcohol control agents and __martese__ johnson , an african-american student at uva . it made headlines around the country and prompted gov. terry mcauliffe to order an independent virginia state police investigation into what happened . the on-campus forum is scheduled for 1 p.m. friday . in a facebook post , the university 's student council said representatives from charlottesville , virginia , police , albemarle county police and the state alcohol beverage control were to attend the forum `` to engage in a conversation about their relationship with students , or lack thereof , and about the issue of police brutality . '' johnson 's arrest prompted protests among students demanding `` justice for __martese__ '' after images circulated showing his bloodied face and clothing . while what happened wednesday remains under investigation , video from the incident shows johnson pinned to the ground , screaming : `` i go to uva ! ... you f ****** racists ! what the f *** ? how did this happen ? '' an officer can be heard telling the man to stop fighting . according to the student 's attorney , daniel watkins , `` just before handcuffing him , police took __martese__ to the ground , striking his head on the pavement and causing him to bleed profusely from the gash on his head . '' he needed 10 stitches to close the gash in his head , watkins said . johnson was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice , according to the virginia department of alcoholic beverage control , which acknowledged he suffered injuries during his arrest . the agents were placed on administrative duties during the investigation , the agency said . the black student alliance said the arrest reminds black uva students `` of the gruesome reality that we are not immune to injustice . '' in a news release , the university called the arrest disturbing , and university president teresa sullivan issued a statement saying that `` every member of our community should feel safe from the threat of bodily harm and other forms of violence . '' virginia attorney general mark herring appealed for patience . `` certainly the images that we 've all been looking at in charlottesville are shocking , but it 's really important that we get the facts out and understand exactly what happened , '' johnson said . friday 's forum will be held at a theater on the uva campus . the student council said media would not be allowed to ask questions or bring cameras into the forum but said the event would be __live-streamed__ on the internet . `` this is a student space -- a chance for students to ask the questions they feel are most pressing to virginia 's most senior law enforcement officials , '' the group said on facebook . students leaders asked their contemporaries to tweet questions in advance . as of __midmorning__ friday , only a handful of tweets had crossed using the proposed hashtag '' __#policedialogue__ . '' `` is the problematic influence of implicit bias discussed at all during police training , '' twitter user __yaejmeister__ asked . among other questions , one student asked why alcohol control agents have police powers . a third wondered `` is catering to uva 's __hypersensitivity__ preparing our students for the world outside of ` grounds ' ? '' the incident comes amid a continuing nationwide debate over the use of force by police , particularly involving african-americans , following the deaths last summer of michael brown in ferguson , missouri , and eric garner in new york . grand juries in both communities declined to indict white police officers in the deaths , leading to angry protests nationwide and calls for renewed attention to claims of police bullying and brutality .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- all 11 service members aboard an army black hawk helicopter that crashed in waters off the florida panhandle two days ago are believed dead , and the operation has transitioned from rescue to recovery , an air force official said thursday . the military is now focused on recovering the helicopter , which searchers found at the bottom of the santa rosa sound near __eglin__ air force base , and the bodies of all seven marines and four louisiana army national guard members who were aboard , air force col. monte cannon said . also ahead : trying to determine why the aircraft went down in thick fog during a training mission tuesday , cannon said . `` the decision to suspend is always difficult , '' said layne carter , search and rescue mission coordinator of the u.s. coast guard . `` with heavy hearts , we have decided to suspend active search and rescue operations . our thoughts and prayers are with the friends and family of the members involved in this tragedy . '' the bodies of at least two national guard members were recovered thursday , and the remains of the other two were believed to be in the underwater wreckage 25 feet below the surface , the guard said . the troops were with __1-244th__ assault helicopter battalion from hammond , louisiana , according to a statement from the louisiana national guard . the military had previously said that some remains had washed ashore wednesday . military officials declined to say thursday how many bodies still were missing , and they did not release the names of the service members involved in the crash . two black hawk helicopters were training near __eglin__ in heavy fog when one of them went down in the sound -- a narrow body of water between mainland northern florida and a barrier island -- about 8:30 p.m. tuesday , the military has said . a couple of military boats already were in the water for safety purposes as part of the exercise , but `` nobody saw anything because of the dense fog , '' said mark giuliano , chief of the __eglin__ air force base 's fire department . `` people said they heard a loud bang , and that was it , '' giuliano said thursday . the second black hawk -- which , like the first , was assigned to the __1-244th__ assault helicopter battalion based in hammond , louisiana -- safely returned to the base , some 40 miles east of pensacola . `` whatever the trouble was with the one aircraft , it did not involve the second helicopter that was participating in the exercise , '' __eglin__ spokesman andy __bourland__ said earlier this week . giuliano said his fire department , which has a unit on santa rosa island near the crash site , was called to help at about 10 p.m. tuesday , roughly 90 minutes after the crash . the military boats that were part of the mission already had been searching for survivors and wreckage , he said . investigators from the army and the marines will try to determine what caused the wreck , cannon said thursday . military officials have said it 's too early to know whether the fog contributed to the crash . the 11 service members , all men , were involved in a seven-day training exercise of amphibious operations , said capt. barry morris , a spokesman for the u.s. marines corps special operations command . it involved small boats , and inserting and extracting marines from the water via helicopter . morris would not say which phase of the training the marines were in tuesday night . the seven marines were with a marine special operations regiment out of camp lejeune , north carolina . the initial search was hampered by dense fog , to the point that searchers on boats `` could not see , '' giuliano said . on wednesday morning , after searchers got a sonar hit , a diver found the bulk of the wreck at the bottom of the sound , giuliano said . divers then went into the water `` to start retrieving the aircrew , '' giuliano said , without specifying how many bodies were recovered . the helicopter had broken into several pieces in a `` __high-impact__ crash , '' he said . the coast guard has hired a salvage company from mobile , alabama , to take the wreckage from the water , but that company might not arrive until thursday evening , and weather conditions may delay the recovery until friday , giuliano said . gen. martin dempsey , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , expressed his condolences on wednesday . he said the crash was `` a reminder to us that those who serve put themselves at risk , both in training and in combat . '' `` we will work with the services to ensure that ... their family members will be well cared for .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- i met kelly gissendaner in january 2010 in a nondescript classroom at metro state prison for women in atlanta . she arrived for class beaming with excitement about the journey she was about to begin -- participation in a yearlong academic theology program sponsored jointly by four atlanta __seminaries__ . since she has been sentenced to the death penalty and lives in solitary confinement , kelly was particularly eager to share community with others , if only one morning a week . and she was grateful for the opportunity to explore the bible and theology in a rigorous manner that would nurture and deepen her __devotional__ life . that image of her on the first day of class remains vivid to me because it captures the core of who kelly is -- who she has become : someone full of contagious joy and gratitude , open to others and to new experiences for growth and ministry . kelly 's process of transformation began shortly after she arrived in prison following her conviction for murder in the death of her husband , doug gissendaner . a pastor began visiting her and initiated a series of difficult , yet compassionate , conversations that urged her toward courageous __self-reflection__ . this same pastor has been visiting kelly for almost 16 years . her commitment to kelly , along with that of the prison chaplain and __chaplaincy__ interns , provided steady , ongoing love that fostered change . so by the time i met kelly in 2010 she had already undergone a significant transformation . she was , in the words of the apostle paul , a `` new creation '' -lrb- 2 __cor__ . __5:17__ -rrb- . in the theology program , kelly found her own voice and came to see that her reflections on christian faith could be a gift to the wider church `` on the outside , '' as well as in prison . by studying historical and contemporary christian thinkers , kelly became part of the conversations that make the christian tradition dynamic . she asked honest questions about her relationship to god , others and the world . she read scripture and grappled with centuries-old theological questions . she discovered her authentic theological voice in the midst of this work . `` from the start of the theology class i felt this hunger , '' she said in her 2011 graduation speech . `` i became so hungry for theology , and what all the classes had to offer ; you could call me a __glutton__ . '' one of the great joys of being a theology professor is getting to know students __holistically__ , not only as thinkers , but also as human beings wrestling with some of life 's most urgent questions . my relationship with kelly had this quality from the start . but it deepened six months into the year when a new warden arrived at the prison . in her graduation speech , kelly described this moment : . `` there came a time when ... my worst fears became my reality -- i was pulled from the courses . i was taken from my theological community . being pulled from the program devastated me as badly as if someone had just told me one of my appeals had been turned down . `` since i could n't go to the theology class ... the instructors came to me . still , this was far from being ideal because now i had to have class and community through a gate . it was hard ... but i pushed on . i pushed on because of that hunger . that gate ... was meant to keep everyone and everything separated from me . but that gate could n't keep out the knowledge that i was so hungry for , nor friendship and community . and it sure could n't keep out god . '' this change afforded us the chance to have two hours of one-on-one conversation every friday . we continued to read theological texts together , including a book by __then-archbishop__ of canterbury rowan williams . williams describes healing and restoration as the act of facing our painful memories , `` the ruins of the past , '' and building from them here and now . restoration , williams writes , `` is going back to the memories of the painful , humiliating past and bringing them to redemption in the present ... to christ -lsb- who -rsb- comes to repair the devastation . '' i sat with kelly as she went back over some of her own painful memories , took responsibility for them and showed profound remorse about who she had been and what she had done . indeed , the power of these moments -- when kelly looked me in the eye and confessed concrete sins , when we spoke of god 's love and forgiveness -- will stay with me forever . kelly embraced what dietrich __bonhoeffer__ , a german __pastor-theologian__ and nazi __resister__ , calls `` costly grace . '' for __bonhoeffer__ , `` cheap grace '' is seeking god 's forgiveness as a `` cover-up for one 's sins , for which one has no remorse and ... even less desire to be set free . '' in contrast , costly grace requires rigorously following jesus in a way that leads to continuous , visible transformation , what the new testament calls the fruits of redemption . the fruits of kelly 's redemption are now well-documented : reconciliation with her children , ministry to inmates full of despair , counsel to troubled youth and daily concern for others . on the night kelly thought would be her last , she spent the evening writing a letter to her fellow inmates , urging them not to worry about her , but to be encouraged . most poignant for kelly are the writings of german __theologian__ __jürgen__ __moltmann__ , who is widely known as the `` __theologian__ of hope '' and with whom kelly began corresponding in 2010 . __moltmann__ shows that biblical hope is not a hope that gives up on this life and looks for something better beyond the grave . rather , hope makes manifest the kingdom of god now -- god 's intended social order `` on earth as it is in heaven '' -lrb- matt . __6:10__ -rrb- . biblical hope `` __revolutionizes__ and transforms the present . '' it is the hope of the __psalmist__ who `` looks for the goodness of god in this life '' -lrb- ps . __27:13__ -rrb- . in the words of kelly 's favorite scripture , it is a hope that proclaims : `` i shall not die but live , and declare the works of the lord '' -lrb- ps __118:17__ -rrb- . in kelly 's own words : . `` the theology program has shown me that hope is still alive and that , despite a gate or a guillotine hovering over my head , i still possess the ability to prove that i am human . labels on anyone can be notoriously misleading and unforgiving things . but no matter the label attached to me , i have the capacity and the unstoppable desire to accomplish something positive and have a lasting impact ... even prison can not erase my hope or conviction that the future is not settled for me , or anyone . '' many people have asked me in recent days how i have been transformed by my friendship with kelly and by kelly 's journey of hope . while i struggle to find adequate words , what i do know is that kelly 's story pushes the logic of christian faith to its __outermost__ limits . it pushes christians to __reexamine__ and reaffirm the truths we proclaim about repentance , forgiveness , redemption and hope . indeed , even professional __theologians__ and life-long pastors struggle with the weight of the claims we make . today , kelly 's life hangs in the balance . the state of georgia on monday issued a last-minute postponement of her execution , citing concerns about the drugs that were to be used to kill her . the department of corrections has said that it plans to resume executions once an analysis of the drugs is complete . while gov. nathan deal does not have the formal power to commute kelly 's sentence to life in prison , i join more than 1,100 faith leaders from across the nation , including more than 500 from georgia , who have signed a letter urging the governor to use his political influence to save kelly 's life and to speak out publicly against her execution . i call on all people of good will to reach out to gov. deal and to georgia state legislators to demand a more just , merciful , and accountable system of justice -- for kelly and for all . as __theologian__ richard __amesbury__ wrote , `` if the life even of a convicted murderer can be turned around and so radically redirected , then none of us is without hope . '' we need to hear kelly gissendaner proclaim to us -- as much as we proclaim to her -- that the promises of god are real .

ARTICEL:     tunis -lrb- cnn -rrb- the bodies of four italian tourists slain in a terror attack on tunisia 's __bardo__ museum three days ago arrived back in italy on saturday , an official with the tunis crisis center told cnn , but 14 victims ' remains still lie in the morgue . as tunisia gets back on its feet , the investigation into wednesday 's shooting at the tunis landmark continues . most of the 23 victims were foreigners , making the process of identification more complicated . nineteen of them were tourists who 'd been on two cruise ships that docked in tunis . french , spanish , italian , british , japanese , russian and colombian citizens are among those to have been formally identified so far . the bodies of the italians were met in rome by italian prime minister matteo renzi , who paid his respects to the victims and their families in a brief ceremony . eleven people who were injured in the attack remained in the hospital in tunisia on saturday , the official at the tunis crisis center said . tunisian prime minister habib __essid__ identified two suspects in the attack , __yassine__ __labidi__ and saber __khachnaou__ , in an interview with french radio station rtl on thursday , though it was n't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by tunisian security forces . he said __yassine__ was `` known to the security services , he was flagged and monitored , '' but not known or being followed for anything special . authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack , including four directly linked to it , according to a statement from tunisian president __beji__ __caid__ __essebsi__ . an uncle of __yassine__ __labidi__ , __abeld__ malik __labidi__ , told cnn on friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26-year-old nephew . but he said __yassine__ __labidi__ was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum . `` it 's true that __yassine__ carried out this terrorist attack , he was killed ; his head , his body , we do n't have it back , '' he said . but , he said , he believed __yassine__ and other young tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money , organized the logistics and took them to places like syria and libya to train as fighters . he had known his nephew well , he said . `` after the revolution of 2011 he started to pray , before he would drink beers from time to time , like a young tunisian . he was n't extreme in any way . '' the only thing that raised questions was that __yassine__ had disappeared for about a month , he said . although his nephew said he 'd gone to the tunisian city of __sfax__ to work , his family now suspected he had been in libya because of the phone numbers he called from . `` when he came back his behavior was the same : he was still himself , calm , serious . nobody noticed anything , even the neighbors i spoke to , '' said __abeld__ malik __labidi__ . `` he said hello to everyone , he prayed , he took his coffee , even on the day of the attack he took his coffee with his family and went to work . '' __abeld__ malik __labidi__ said __yassine__ 's father , sister and brother had undergone lengthy interrogations by anti-terror police since the attack . officers had seized his nephew 's computer and phone , as well as taking samples of his fingerprints , he said . a cousin of __yassine__ , who asked not to be named , told cnn that the family was shocked by what had happened . `` we are all shocked , we lost someone even if what he did was wrong , may god forgive him . those he killed were innocent , why would you go and harm australians or japanese ... our islam does n't mention about killing people , islam has never been this , '' he said . he also said he had no idea how his cousin had been radicalized , saying he was `` a normal tunisian guy ... but not an extremist . '' security minister rafik __chelly__ said on friday that the two extremists who attacked the museum got weapons training at camps in libya . the suspects were activated from sleeper cells in tunisia , he said . he did not say which group activated them , or with whom they trained . `` they left the country illegally last december for libya , and they were able to train with weapons there , '' he told private broadcaster __alhiwar__ __ettounsi__ tv . like tunisia , libya saw its longtime leader moammar gadhafi ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the arab spring . but unlike its neighbor to the west , libya has been fraught with more instability and violence -- much of it perpetrated by islamist militants . in an audio message posted online thursday , isis claimed responsibility for wednesday 's attack , which it said targeted `` crusaders and __apostates__ '' with `` automatic weapons and hand grenades . '' cnn can not independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement . that bloodshed is `` just the start , '' the isis message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow , but nonetheless adds extra urgency for tunisian investigators . cnn 's claudia __rebaza__ reported from tunis and laura smith-spark wrote from london . cnn 's __radina__ __gigova__ and greg botelho contributed to this report .

'' `` it 's going to be a close fight in downhill and super-g , so i will really have to ski my best at the finals in meribel . hopefully i can get two titles , '' added vonn , who is 35 points ahead of __fenninger__ in the downhill standings . but vonn is well off the pace in the fight for the overall crown -- which she last won in 2012 , her fourth success -- in third place almost 200 points behind the austrian . maze is another 44 points ahead of __fenninger__ , with just two slalom events in sweden next week before the march __16-22__ finale . `` of course it 's a great result but i prefer to win , '' the slovenian said . `` lindsey was simply better today and she deserves this win . `` my whole team stands behind me and supports me and i am really thankful to them . __valerio__ did a great job setting the course . it was a fast and nice course set with not too many turns . '' __fenninger__ , who also won the world giant slalom title at beaver creek , said she will focus on her strengths after claiming a 12th podium this season . `` it was a fast super-g and that 's maybe not what i am the best at , '' said the 25-year-old . `` overall it 's been a good weekend . honestly i thought tina was going to be better than me in the downhill and that i would catch up in the super-g . it turned out to be different . `` i am focusing on my strengths , this is why i am not going to race slalom next week . now i have to train giant slalom in order to show my best skiing and maximize my chances to win the giant slalom globe . '' meanwhile , __kjetil__ __jansrud__ clinched the men 's super-g title with victory on home snow in in __kvitfjell__ on sunday . the norwegian , who missed out on securing the downhill crystal globe when he finished seventh on saturday , opened up an unassailable __123-point__ lead over italian dominik paris . `` this is the first globe of my career , '' said the 29-year-old . `` it 's good to not have to go into the final weekend feeling like there are two guys pushing me on the cup and i have to fend off both of them . that 's a big thing because i can leave the super-g and focus on the downhill . '' __jansrud__ has a __20-point__ lead over __hannes__ __reichelt__ in the downhill , but is less confident of overhauling his __52-point__ deficit on another austrian , three-time defending champion marcel hirscher , in the overall standings . the men next travel to slovenia for slalom events next weekend . `` i think he will gain some extra points in __kranjska__ __gora__ , so i 'm not very concerned about the overall , '' __jansrud__ said of hirscher . `` i think he 'll pull through . but it might get exciting . he has no room for error and anything can happen .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- melissa was sold into the sex trade by a family member when she was only 12 years old . her life became a prison : chained to a bed in a warehouse , she endured regular beatings , rapes and once was even set on fire by her captors as she was forced to serve 5 to 30 men every day . the experience was enough for her to wish she was dead . and this all took place in texas -- right here , in our own country . melissa miraculously escaped her captors but , as is the case with so many other victims , she struggled for years to distance herself from her past , even finding herself in jail on multiple occasions . and while institutionalized slavery has long been cast from america 's history books , thousands of children still suffer from the bonds of sex trafficking . indeed , with the average age of a victim only 13 years old , these horrific crimes are stealing the innocent childhoods of kids across america . and the problem is n't confined to one part of the country . in , minnesota , for example , a 12-year-old girl received a text message that she thought was from a friend . it invited her to go to a party and asked her to go to a fast food restaurant nearby . but she did n't get to a party . instead , she was taken to a hotel and raped by a 34-year-old pimp , forced to take explicit photos of herself that were then posted on craigslist , before being forced to have sex with two more men who saw the post . these heartbreaking stories demonstrate what is broken about our current system , and why we both feel committed to fixing it . instead of treating people like these young girls as the victims they are , they are often thrown into the criminal justice system , labeled prostitutes and left with few options but to return to a nightmare that shockingly still exists in the united states . meanwhile , instead of treating their perpetrators as child rapists and traffickers , they are often simply treated as `` johns '' who , if caught , often pay a fine and go on their way . this is outrageous , and should not be tolerated any longer . that is why we 've joined forces with more than 200 advocacy groups to fight this modern-day slave trade and provide hope and opportunity for its victims . two bills we have introduced to combat this horrific crime recently passed the senate judiciary committee with strong support and will have the opportunity for consideration by the senate . the justice for victims of trafficking act -lrb- __jvta__ -rrb- would support victims by taking fines and criminal assets from convicted human traffickers and directing them toward services and treatment to help victims restore their lives . the __jvta__ does n't only help victims , it also arms law enforcement with more tools to go after human traffickers . it ensures these criminals , including `` johns , '' are brought to justice under our laws , because a financial transaction should not mask assault on a child . the second bill is modeled after minnesota 's `` safe harbor '' law , which helps make sure minors sold for sex are n't prosecuted as defendants , but are instead treated as victims . the stop exploitation through trafficking act -lrb- __sett__ -rrb- would give incentives for all states to have a safe harbor provision . when a state passes a safe harbor law , it means that kids sold for sex are steered towards child protection services , rather than being arrested , charged , or convicted under a state 's criminal statutes . all across the country , from texas to minnesota , young people are being robbed of their innocence and subjected to unthinkable horrors and abuse . we must do everything we can to free them from the shackles of sex trafficking . we must join together and take action to combat this modern-day slavery once and for all .

ARTICEL:     washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- if it looks like a treaty , walks like a treaty and talks like a treaty , is it a treaty ? according to the white house , only if the president of the united states says it is . that 's infuriating republicans and even some democrats , who are demanding that the obama administration submit any final nuclear deal with iran to congress for approval . `` this is clearly a treaty , '' arizona sen. john mccain told reporters tuesday . `` they can call it a banana , but it 's a treaty . '' kerry denounces gop letter to iran leaders . the gop position could jeopardize the long-term survival of any iran deal , and it represents the party 's newest clash with president barack obama over the limits of executive authority , as republicans object to a pact they warn could eventually give tehran a nuclear bomb . it 's that skepticism that has largely led the white house to define the deal as a `` __nonbinding__ agreement '' rather than a `` treaty , '' which the constitution requires senate `` advice and consent '' on . the distinction -- and whether it can legitimately be used to shut out congress -- turns on complicated and unresolved questions of constitutional law . while republicans call foul , the administration defends the __differentiation__ as perfectly sound , and no surprise . secretary of state john kerry stressed wednesday that the administration never intended to negotiate a treaty . `` we 've been clear from the beginning . we 're not negotiating a ` legally binding plan . ' we 're negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement , '' he said at a senate hearing . that does n't sit well with republicans , many of whom believe the senate 's constitutional role is being bypassed . idaho sen. james __risch__ dismissed the administration 's argument : `` let there be no mistake , this is a treaty that is being negotiated . it 's a treaty and should be treated as such . '' did 47 republican senators break the law in plain sight ? republicans see criticism of the administration 's maneuver as a way to gum up the works on the current deal , and to push their larger assault on the white house 's exercise of power . at the senate hearing wednesday , kentucky republican rand paul explicitly tied the administration 's bid to keep the deal away from congress to other accusations of white house overreach . `` this is an administration that seeks to legislate when that is not in their __purview__ , whether it be immigration , whether it be health care , '' he charged , noting that he had joined 46 other gop senators in signing a letter to the islamic republic informing them of congress 's role in approving binding agreements . `` i signed the letter to iran . but you know what ? the message i was sending was to you , '' he told kerry . `` i signed it to an administration that does n't listen , to an administration that , every turn , tries to go around congress because you think you ca n't get your way . '' but legal experts say that though a court challenge along the lines of pending gop cases on immigration and health care is possible in theory , it would be a long shot . there is no currently no suit on the issue being discussed on capitol hill , and it 's far from clear that republicans would be standing on firm legal ground with such a challenge . the debate , rumbling for decades , has yet to be definitively resolved in case law . `` it is a very interesting question , '' said nicholas burns , a former senior u.s. diplomat , arguing that it is essentially up to the administration to decide whether it is negotiating an agreement that formally binds the united states to commitments under international law ; i.e. , a treaty , or a less stringent arrangement . senators grill obama officials on iran . jim walsh , a specialist on the iran nuclear program at the massachusetts institute of technology , said the iran deal , which commits the united states to waive or lift sanctions , does not rise to the level of a formal treaty . `` treaties traditionally have involved reductions in armaments , nuclear weapons , conventional forces . they require us to take something away that we have already built or established . '' in this case , the united states would lift sanctions , but would not be changing its military posture . `` we have had all sorts of agreement that were never ratified by congress , '' walsh said . but david __rivkin__ , a constitutional and international law expert who worked for president george h.w. bush , said that any international agreement requiring major __undertakings__ on the part of the united states -- such as the proposed iran deal -- must be sent to the senate for advice and consent . `` the constitution is quite clear , '' he said . republicans point to none less than the vice president of the united states to bolster their case . when vice president joe biden was a senator in 2002 , he wrote a letter to then-secretary of state colin powell charging that a planned strategic arms reductions deal with russia constituted a treaty subject to senate approval since it would require `` significant obligations by the united states . '' but biden 's 2002 letter did n't keep him from unleashing his fury at the gop letter to iran on monday . `` around the world , america 's influence depends on its ability to honor its commitments , '' biden said in a statement . while congress approves some agreements , `` as the authors of this letter must know , the vast majority of our international commitments take effect without congressional approval . '' indeed , in the letter he penned to iran , arkansas sen. tom cotton acknowledged that the administration could seek a mere `` executive agreement '' free of congressional review . obama , iranian official slam gop letter on deal . presidents claim inherent powers to conclude executive agreements under article ii of the constitution . u.s. law stipulates that an agreement is only viewed as a treaty once it has been made with `` the advice and consent of the senate , '' a study by the nonpartisan congressional research service noted . but administrations often choose to conclude deals with foreign states that do n't satisfy that requirement . such an `` executive agreement '' is still considered a treaty that is binding under international law , but does not reach the same standard under u.s. law , according to the study . examples of `` __nonbinding__ '' documents include a __u.s.-russia__ to remove syria 's stocks of chemical weapons and the proliferation security initiative to stop the global shipment of the weapons of mass destruction components . biden argued monday that this practice is as old as the united states itself . `` under presidents of both parties , such major shifts in american foreign policy as diplomatic recognition of the people 's republic of china , the resolution of the iran hostage crisis , and the conclusion of the vietnam war were all conducted without congressional approval , '' he said in his statement opposing the gop letter . the white house would clearly prefer a binding agreement with iran , which would have a better chance of longevity . but the strength of opposition in congress makes that route impossible . according to republicans such as cotton , the only deal the senate would approve is one that completely bans iranian uranium enrichment . obama has said that goal is simply not realistic . so republicans , dissatisfied with what 's emerging from negotiations , are seizing on the vulnerability of a deal that lacks treaty status . many see that as a more viable path for disruption than the case on administration overreach . `` if congress does n't approve this deal , congress wo n't accept this deal , now or in the future , '' cotton told cnn . in the letter , he informed iranian leaders that many senators will serve terms longer than obama , so they would have to reckon with the senate at some point . lawmakers can refuse to lift sanctions down the road or try to choke off funds for the deal 's implementation . the administration acknowledges that congress will have to get involved at some point . obama currently has the power to lift or waive certain sanctions against iran for the duration of his presidency and encourage u.s. international partners to follow suit . but he does not have the power to lift sanctions imposed by congress , which include some of the most punitive measures against iran . `` part of the agreement is going to involve sanctions relief to the iranian government that is meted out over time , '' deputy national security adviser ben rhodes told cnn . `` at some time in the duration of this agreement , congress will have to be heard on sanctions relief . '' senior u.s. officials have acknowledged that the clamor among lawmakers for a role , as well as their public criticisms , also implicitly highlights the vulnerability of their case and an ultimate agreement . tim kaine , a democratic senator from virginia who has signed onto a bill calling for the white house to put any deal up for a vote in congress , said that obama is within his rights to do what he is doing -- up to a point . `` it is not a treaty . if it were a treaty , there is a clear process . it would require a two-thirds vote in the senate . '' but kaine told cnn on wednesday that lawmakers did have a role to play at the point when sanctions mandated by congress are bargained away to ensure iran sticks to limits on its nuclear program . `` congress has got to weigh in at some point , '' kaine said .

'' drew knows just how big an impact that high-profile stage can have on aspiring professionals from beyond the major college ranks . his __last-second__ shot for valparaiso to beat the university of mississippi in the first round of the 1998 tournament is one of the most replayed moments in march madness history . how it works : . selection sunday -lrb- march 15 -rrb- . a __10-member__ panel determines __seedings__ for the 68 teams that make the knockout tournament . first four -lrb- march __17-18__ -rrb- . a format started in 2011 , 8 teams compete to qualify in the main draw . second round -lrb- march __19-20__ -rrb- . 64 teams split into 4 regions : midwest , west , south and east . # 1 plays # 16 in each group . third round -lrb- march __21-22__ -rrb- . down to 32 teams . regional semifinals -lrb- march __26-27__ -rrb- . known as the `` sweet sixteen '' regional finals -lrb- march __28-29__ -rrb- . the `` elite eight '' national semifinals -lrb- april 4 -rrb- . the `` final four '' is played at lucas oil stadium in indianapolis ; minimum capacity 70,000 . championship game -lrb- april 6 -rrb- . one of the most-watched events in u.s. sport . `` i had always dreamed of winning the game in the ncaa tournament -lrb- and -rrb- always dreamed of making the __last-second__ shot . for god to bless -lrb- me -rrb- with both of things at one time is something that i 'll always cherish and remember , '' drew says . his father , homer drew , was valparaiso 's coach at the time , and his brother scott -lrb- now men 's basketball coach at baylor university -rrb- was an assistant , completing the hollywood scenario . `` i do n't think any of us realized that they would show that replay the next year , and even the next year , and the next year . we were just so happy in the moment and never thought that we 'd be able to talk about it over a decade later , '' he says . showing the highlight is virtually a prerequisite whenever drew coaches a nationally televised game , and is sure to come up next week when his crusaders play in the `` big dance '' -lrb- one more nickname for the tournament . -rrb- . drew was a senior nearing graduation at the time . although he had heard about professional scouts attending his games , being drafted by an nba team was still considered a __longshot__ . after all , the last time a valparaiso graduate __dribbled__ a basketball in the nba was in 1956 . but that was before `` the shot . '' although drew says private workouts for pro teams solidified his spot as the first valparaiso player to be drafted in the nba 's first round -lrb- as the 16th pick , -rrb- he confesses that tournament attention is likely what got his foot in the door . `` it helped me get my name out there , because they got to see me play against a different type of athlete in the ncaa tournament on a different stage , '' he says . observing athletes during march madness -- when competition is at its highest level -- is the best way to gauge if they will succeed as pros , according to one player representative . `` it definitely helps an agent to learn how a player will perform under a national stage , '' says jared __karnes__ , co-founder of a3 athletics agency in knoxville , tennessee . `` if they want to play in the nba , they are going to be expected to play under a tremendous amount of pressure and attention . '' michael beasley , the second overall selection in the 2008 nba draft , is one of __karnes__ ' clients who has failed to live up to that pressure so far . now 26 , he recently found his way back to the nba with the miami heat after a spell in china . __karnes__ , a former player himself at little-known belmont university who `` had the unfortunate assignment of having to guard bryce drew , '' says he enjoys recruiting clients from smaller programs because they lack the air of entitlement that can weigh on household names . `` a lot of times they 've had to work their way into the spotlight , and so they develop a hard work ethic , '' he says . `` they really have an appreciation about what 's happened to them ; the more you can identify a talent with a level of high character , as an agent you 've just found a terrific prospect . '' among the most successful __small-program__ players in the nba is former davidson standout stephen curry -- the current mvp frontrunner with the golden state warriors . norris cole , who played at cleveland state and won two championships with the miami heat , and gordon hayward , a starting forward for the utah jazz , have also made their mark . cole strikes a particular chord with drew since they both came out of the unheralded horizon league , a division one conference made up of nine midwestern schools . it was the less glamorous side of the game that set cole apart from other prospects . `` his defense is what helped him get drafted from our league , '' says drew , who suited up for four nba teams in six seasons before playing in italy and spain . `` a lot of guys can score and shoot , but when you get to the nba , really being able to defend someone separates you . '' hayward led butler -- a so-called `` __mid-major__ '' program that exited the horizon league two years ago -- all the way to the 2010 national championship game against duke , only to watch his desperation __half-court__ shot narrowly miss at the buzzer . although hayward turned pro after the two-point loss , butler 's exposure to potential recruits allowed the bulldogs to return to the championship game the next year , and to the third round in 2013 . with an enrollment of only 4,500 students , it is the smallest school to play in the final for over 30 years . in 2013 , butler 's 36-year-old brad stevens became the youngest head coach in the nba when he signed a $ 22 million contract with the boston celtics . `` even though they are so wildly successful as a team -lrb- now , -rrb- butler right before that was n't well known , '' says __karnes__ , adding that it was hayward who first put it on the map . `` you can find diamonds in these smaller schools . '' drew hopes to emulate butler 's past success this postseason . he 's already led valparaiso to its highest victory total and winning percentage in school history . led by __6-foot-10-inch__ jamaican senior __vashil__ fernandez -lrb- five blocked shots against green bay in the horizon league tournament final -rrb- and 6 ' 9 '' sophomore alec peters , the crusaders are hoping for a high seed when a __10-member__ committee meets this `` selection sunday '' to rank the tournament 's 68 participants . valparaiso 's nightmare scenario would be an __early-round__ pairing with last year 's runner-up kentucky . the wildcats -lrb- __31-0__ -rrb- aim to become the first team to go undefeated and win the national championship since the indiana __hoosiers__ in 1976 . drew calls coach john __calipari__ 's team -- powered by a front line of __7-footers__ willie __cauley-stein__ and __dakari__ johnson , along with 6 ' 11 '' __karl-anthony__ towns -- as the deepest he 's ever seen in college basketball . six of kentucky 's players are considered worthy of june 's nba draft . while __karnes__ remains guarded about which college basketball players he 's scouting , inking deals with kentucky players after the tournament is probably a __longshot__ . `` you talk about these smaller schools that are out there , we 're that way as a boutique agency , '' he says .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- this week , google cfo patrick __pichette__ made headlines when his resignation memo announcing his retirement surfaced in the media . but the uproar was n't that __pichette__ was quitting so much as why . `` after nearly seven years as cfo , '' he began , `` i will be retiring from google to spend more time with my family . '' what he wanted now was to enjoy life at home and abroad with his wife , to `` grab our backpacks and hit the road -- celebrate our last 25 years together by turning the page and enjoy a perfectly fine midlife crisis full of bliss and beauty . '' the letter , which he said he wrote in part because , `` so many people struggle to strike the right balance between work and personal life , '' has been held up as a manifesto for the `` __work/life__ balance '' ideal that 's become something of the new american dream . the media has described it as `` powerful '' and `` unusually reflective . '' google co-founder and ceo larry page said , `` well worth reading , it will warm your heart . '' but if __pichette__ 's __work/life__ balance was achieved by quitting his job to go see the world , what message does it send to the rest of us seeking __work/life__ balance ? what message does it send to those workers -- and in particular women -- who are constantly told they can `` have it all , '' or who can be at the top of their field and have a family ? what does it say to all those women to whom we say that , with a little `` leaning in '' or `` playing big '' they do n't have to choose between work and life ? successful women from sheryl sandberg to pepsico ceo __indra__ __nooyi__ have spoken out about the pressure to `` have it all , '' and how , perhaps , there 's really no such thing . research backs them up . a november 2014 study published in the journal of health and social behavior found that women show more signs of depression as they move up the career ladder . similarly , a survey of harvard business school grads found that the pressure women put on themselves to balance work and family is causing them significant stress . the survey also found that the majority of men expected their partners to take primary responsibility for childcare -- and indeed that happened in more than 70 % of cases . and yet in recent years , `` __work/life__ balance '' has been held up as a legitimately attainable ideal , one that you can achieve if only you give your personal life as much attention as your professional one . but if you look at those we tend to hold up as models of that ideal -- those who leave work earlier , silence their cellphones more , retire , as in the case of __pichette__ , at 52 -- are they really striking a balance ? which is why talking about __work/life__ balance at all is a perilous business , an invitation to fail . having it all is very difficult , if not downright impossible . __pichette__ , after all , did not practice __work/life__ balance . he wrote , `` i was always on -- even when i was not supposed to be . '' like many successful men -lrb- and women -rrb- , he was likely able to work as hard as he did while still having a family because he had the support of someone at home . `` when our kids are asked by their friends about the success of the longevity of our marriage , they simply joke that tamar and i have spent so little time together that ` it 's really too early to tell ' if our marriage will in fact succeed . '' it 's in jest , of course , and yet likely rooted in some serious reality . this is a man who did n't achieve __work/life__ balance as an executive . of course , one could argue that the idea of balancing work with life may be harder for men than for women , who are the traditional __breadwinners__ and the ones more likely to find self-worth through their work . this is one reason we see many wealthy , powerful men working well into their 80s . at the same time , it 's undeniably easier for these men to make a decision to leave the whole thing early . __pichette__ retires as google 's highest paid executive , with millions in stock incentives . he can afford to retire and not even have to work for the remainder of his life . the rest of us are nowhere close to having that luxury of choice . corporate america , it should be noted , shoulders much of the blame for keeping balance at arm 's length , with increasingly long days and __ever-tightening__ limits on vacations , paid leave and other `` benefits . '' we should n't have to leave our jobs to achieve balance , and the fact that some do , means that companies need to make real changes . that includes staffing workplaces reasonably , putting workers ' well-being on par with profits , showing workers you do n't expect them to be `` on '' all the time . only then will real work / life balance start to take shape . until then : `` google cfo patrick __pichette__ 's goodbye note will make you dream of quitting your job , '' so reads a headline at abc news . indeed , that 's the kicker . __pichette__ can `` __carpe__ __diem__ '' and `` find balance , '' if that 's what he 's doing , at 52 , because he truly does have choices . but for most of the workers in america , finding that sort of balance -- or choosing life over work -- will remain an impossible dream .

ARTICEL:     jerusalem -lrb- cnn -rrb- either benjamin netanyahu just staged the most dramatic political comeback in israeli history and beyond , or something was very wrong with the polls before and during the election . polls predicted a tight race coming down to the wire , with netanyahu in a virtual tie with his main challenger , isaac herzog of the zionist union party . only four days before the election , polls showed herzog taking a __four-seat__ lead into the final weekend before the election . exit polls on the night of the election showed netanyahu had closed the gap . the polls suggested he was in a dead heat , with a very even split between right-wing and left-wing parties . then came the results . not more polls or surveys , but actual counts from the ballot boxes . netanyahu was n't in a fight for his political life after all . he was the clear winner , running away with the election and facing a fairly clear path to create a coalition government . although the results are unofficial , it seems almost certain that netanyahu will remain the israeli prime minister . __avi__ __degani__ , a pollster , professor at tel aviv university and president of the __geocartography__ knowledge group , saw very different results from his own polls . he never anticipated a zionist union victory . instead , he says , he always saw likud holding a lead . the mistake that others made , according to __degani__ , was in the methodology . `` the internet does not represent the state of israel and the people of israel , '' he said , referring to modern statistical methods . `` it represents panels , and the panels are biased strongly to the center -- tel aviv , __better-educated__ , more participants in this kind of conversation . and people who are in the periphery and so on and have the stronger tendency to vote likud , i think , are poorly represented . '' `` i have tested sometimes at the same night , doing by telephone as i do always -- and very specifically geographically , and very __well-weighted__ and very well , having cell phones and other phones and so on -- and at the same time i did on the internet . and i got results which are very , very different . '' but mina __tzemach__ , the polling expert for cnn affiliate channel 2 israel , suggests netanyahu was in a tight race the entire way and managed to close the gap `` like a magician , '' using the election polls as his final trick . `` the polls showed that they are going to lose . it gave very important information both to the public and to the politicians . netanyahu used it , '' said __tzemach__ . `` many voted what we call strategic voting . they did not vote to the party that is their first preference , but they voted for the likud . '' likud voters did not participate in exit polls , according to __tzemach__ , and that skewed the results , leading many to believe that herzog had tied netanyahu . `` we had ballots in an area where there are a lot of immigrants from the former soviet union , '' explained __tzemach__ . `` in these ballots , more than 30 % did not participate in our polls , and they are likud supporters . '' another factor that may have worked in netanyahu 's favor was his likud party __cannibalizing__ votes from other right-wing parties . in the days before the election , netanyahu moved to the political right , making a big push for right-wing voters to choose his party over other ideologically similar parties , such as naftali bennett 's jewish home party and __avigdor__ lieberman 's __yisrael__ __beiteinu__ party . during the weekend before the election , netanyahu took part in a right-wing rally in tel aviv 's central __rabin__ square . he continued his shift to the right in a series of interviews with local media leading up to the election . his most controversial statement came the day before the elections when he reversed his publicly stated position on a two-state solution . `` anyone who is going to establish a palestinian state , anyone who is going to evacuate territories today , is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical islam against israel , '' he said in a television interview . `` this is the true reality that was created here in the last few years . '' in 2009 , in a speech known as the bar __ilan__ speech , netanyahu committed to negotiations for a two-state solution , saying , `` let us begin peace negotiations immediately without prior conditions . israel is committed to international agreements , and expects all sides to fulfill their obligations . i say to the palestinians : we want to live with you in peace , quiet , and good __neighborly__ relations . '' __tzemach__ estimates that likud took four seats from jewish home and two more seats from __yachad__ , a party that did not receive enough votes to warrant inclusion in the knesset , israel 's parliament . exit polls in israel have been wrong before . in the most recent elections in 2013 , exit polls showed __yair__ lapid 's centrist __yesh__ __atid__ party winning between 12 and 13 seats in the knesset . but when the final results were tallied , lapid won 19 seats , becoming a major player in the government . this time , the unexpected surprise worked in netanyahu 's favor , turning the campaign race into an election night rout . likud had never polled better than approximately 25 seats , but it grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the knesset , according to unofficial numbers from the israeli election committee based on 99 % of the vote . netanyahu has worked this sort of magic once before . in the 1996 elections , early results showed the labor party 's shimon peres as the winner , but as more results came in , netanyahu __eked__ out a victory by fewer than 1 % of the votes . __degani__ said this election reveals the truth behind israeli politics . `` this last election it showed very clearly that we do not have right and left . we have only right and extreme right , which is not nice sometimes . and in the right , you have the likud mostly , and in the likud , you have mostly netanyahu . ''

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- new zealand police have revealed a threat to contaminate infant formula and other dairy formula with poison , in an apparent attempt to blackmail the government over its pest control policies . police appealed for public help to find the alleged __blackmailer__ , at a press conference in wellington tuesday . they revealed an investigation had been underway since november , when anonymous letters were sent to giant dairy cooperative __fonterra__ and a farmers ' lobby group . the letters were accompanied by small packages of milk powder containing a concentrated form of __1080__ -lrb- sodium __fluoroacetate__ -rrb- , a poison used by new zealand 's department of conservation to control introduced pest species such as __possums__ and rats . the letters threatened to contaminate infant and other formula with __1080__ unless new zealand stopped using the poison for pest control by the end of march , police said in a statement . the letters said the threat would be made public if the demand was not met . new zealand 's heavy use of __1080__ -- it uses about 80 % of the world 's manufactured stocks , according the country 's environmental protection agency -- has been a controversial issue , with conservationists and farmers generally supporting the measure , and some hunters and animal rights activists opposed . primary industries minister nathan guy said the threat amounted to `` __eco-terrorism__ . '' prime minister john key said at a press conference that police had advised that there was a low likelihood of the threat being carried out . meanwhile , government officials said supplies of formula had not been contaminated , and urged consumers to continue using the products . `` we are confident that new zealand infant and other formula is just as safe today as it was before this threat was made , '' said scott gallacher , deputy director-general of the ministry for primary industries . `` people should keep using it as they always have . '' he said more than 40,000 samples had been taken without finding a trace of __1080__ , and food security measures had also been boosted in response . these included a strengthened security measures in retail stores and a boosted presence at manufacturing sites , and enhanced milk and product testing , including the introduction of a test for __1080__ . `` this criminal threat is designed to cause fear in order to generate a political outcome . it is using food as a vehicle but should not undermine confidence in our world-class food safety system or in any manufacturer , '' he said . he urged consumers to check formula packaging for any signs of tampering as a result of the threat . police said an __auckland-based__ investigation team was pursuing a number of lines of inquiry in locating the source of the threat , but the time was right to appeal to the public . `` whilst there is a possibility that this threat is a hoax , we must treat the threat seriously and a priority investigation is underway , '' said deputy commissioner mike clement . `` you might be aware of someone who has strong views on the __1080__ issue and made threats , or has discussed how to access supplies of __1080__ . '' he also called on the alleged __blackmailer__ to come forward . `` the letter writer may not have really considered the implications of their actions when this communication was drafted . now is the time to put this right by picking up the phone and calling us . '' blackmail carries a maximum sentence of 14 years jail in new zealand . new zealand is the world 's leading dairy exporter , and dairy cooperative __fonterra__ is the country 's biggest company , with revenue of $ 16.3 billion last year . ceo theo __spierings__ described the threat in a press conference as `` a despicable crime . '' the global diary giant has been beset by problems before , most recently in 2013 , when it ordered a global recall of products -- including infant formula -- after fears they might contain bacteria that could cause __botulism__ . the fears proved unfounded , as the bacteria detected was not a __botulism-causing__ strain . new zealand infant formula exporters association chairman michael barnett said eyes were now on the response to the threat in key markets such as china , the biggest consumer of new zealand dairy exports . `` this could be extremely damaging for new zealand 's exports offshore , '' he told cnn affiliate __tvnz__ . `` our whole reputation as an exporter of food is at risk because of this nutter . '' trading in all new __zealand-listed__ dairy companies was halted tuesday with the announcement of the threat . cnn 's charles riley contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- ferguson is crumbling . the cowardly and reprehensible shooting wednesday night of two police officers came in a tumultuous seven days for the missouri town , which had already seen ferguson police chief thomas jackson announce his resignation after a damning justice department report on its police department . the report , which was ordered in the wake of the killing of michael brown last year , highlighted a predatory policing problem and a department that was biased , prejudiced and that has regularly targeted , arrested and fined african-americans . residents understandably want justice . but what 's worse in all this is that ferguson is __illustrative__ of a broader problem across the country as increasingly militarized __majority-white__ police departments demonstrate consistent racial bias toward __majority-black__ communities . it 's a combustible mix . in three-quarters of all u.s. cities with populations 50,000 or more , the police presence is `` disproportionately white relative to the local population , '' according to the washington post . and tensions are being exacerbated by the use among police departments of military weapons , and __stipulations__ that these former war zone weapons must be used within a year of acquisition . all this suggests a need for a completely new mindset on how we try to understand and implement policing practices across america . indeed , a wholesale review of policies and approaches to law enforcement is needed , something that will likely __necessitate__ drastic reforms in some departments so they can better represent , integrate , problem solve and liaise with the communities they are serving . first and foremost , our police departments must better reflect the diverse demographics of our increasingly diverse nation , whether it be race , creed , sexual orientation and more . america is changing fast , but police departments are n't keeping up . training and recruitment of minorities is critical , yet far more needs to be taking place . with this in mind , __amplifying__ community policing models that work and scaling them up immediately is essential if we are to stem the growing and sometimes overwhelming tide of frustration , anger and cynicism welling up among young african , asian and hispanic americans . second , we must radically rethink the trend toward the indiscriminate procurement and use of surplus military grade weaponry , which under the department of defense 's __1033__ program is flowing from battlefields to our local police forces . when the weapons of war come home from iraq and afghanistan to help police america 's cities and towns , then you know something has gone terribly wrong with this country . __mine-resistant__ ambush protected vehicles , tanks , drones , grenades and assault weapons should not replace the community policing of our main streets . ferguson is an excellent example of how the deployment of heavy weaponry __inflames__ rather than __de-escalates__ a crisis situation . having military equipment on our streets does not make citizens feel safer , which is why the stop __militarizing__ law enforcement act was recently reintroduced in congress . we do not need our officers looking like `` robocop '' when they patrol our streets . it 's that simple . yet until such a bill is passed , war weapons will continue to flood our streets ; congress must act to stem this tide . we understand that times have changed and that new security threats require new solutions and procedures . but it does n't justify the 150 raids per day by special weapons and tactics units for incidents that can be as benign as a department of education warrant . this kind of aggressive approach does n't __engender__ the kind of engagement necessary for identifying real risks lurking in a community . in fact , the opposite happens . intelligence opportunities are dead on arrival , and potential allies who would otherwise be ready to help shut down immediately . aggressive __military-type__ action is quickly turning americans against fellow citizens who they are ostensibly there to serve and protect . we therefore trust that president barack obama and attorney general eric holder will take decisive action , working hand in hand with police departments all across this country . yes , the white house 's task force on police militarization was a start , but more concrete measures are needed if we want to reverse the rising anger in ferguson and elsewhere . the time for a change is now . if we do n't press our police departments to reflect the makeup and needs of our communities , then towns like ferguson will unravel further .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- an israeli arab man who is shown being shot by a child in a recent isis video has no connections to israeli intelligence , the country 's defense minister said wednesday . in the video released tuesday , isis claims the man , 19-year-old mohamed said ismail __musallam__ , is an israeli spy . but israeli defense minister moshe __ya'alon__ denied the allegation on israeli radio . the isis video shows __musallam__ 's israeli passport and claims he 's an agent sent to infiltrate the group . __musallam__ 's family on tuesday told cnn that he had no ties with the mossad , israel 's spy agency , and had , in fact , been recruited by isis . __musallam__ is an israeli citizen of palestinian descent . `` mohamed told me and his brother that isis took him , '' according to said __musallam__ , his father . `` they sent him money through the western union . they said you will have girls , money , cars , villas , paradise , but __afterwords__ he discovered that there is nothing . '' it was n't long before __musallam__ 's family members did n't recognize him when they talked to him on skype . the man they knew as a kind and funny brother and son who was once a volunteer firefighter had grown a long beard and was carrying a rifle . his father tried to help him get home , sending him money and even enlisting the red cross . but his son never made it back to israel . about a month ago , said __musallam__ said , he was told his son was taken by isis when he was on his way back and trying to cross the border . a video posted tuesday on __isis-affiliated__ social media accounts shows a man who appears to be __musallam__ on his knees , wearing an orange jumpsuit . an adult isis fighter and a child -- both in fatigues -- stand behind him . the adult , speaking french , gives a command to the child to go forward with the killing . the child steps in front of the man and raises what appears to be a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shoots __musallam__ in the forehead . the man immediately falls forward to the ground . the child appears to then fire at least two more shots into the body . an issue last month of isis ' english-language propaganda magazine , dabiq , included a purported interview with __musallam__ and described his alleged work for the israeli spy agency . in the isis video , __musallam__ seems to be reading what appears to be a prepared confession , saying he is an israeli intelligence agent working for mossad , sent to infiltrate isis . __musallam__ 's family members said they believe he was coerced in the video , forced to lie about ties to israeli intelligence . `` mohamed is not an agent . mohamed does n't have a __shekel__ . if he was an agent he would have lived a beautiful life , '' his mother , hind __musallam__ , said . `` we could have been living a different life and i would not be working cleaning houses so we can live . '' this is n't the first time isis has used children to drive home its message . an isis propaganda video released in january -- one that cnn could not independently verify -- shows a boy with a pistol apparently shooting two men in the back of the head . the boy then stands over one of the bodies , fires two more times , and later raises his pistol high . last august , a photo posted to twitter from an isis stronghold showed a 7-year-old boy holding a man 's severed head and his father 's words , `` that 's my boy . '' isis has featured children as fighters before , calling them the `` cubs of the caliphate '' -lrb- the adult jihadis call each other `` lions '' -rrb- and has encouraged foreign fighters to bring their families . it has taken over schools to __indoctrinate__ children . human rights watch says isis and other extremist groups `` have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks , including suicide bombing missions . '' cnn 's __abeer__ salman contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- by the time cynthia __falardeau__ read about alex pring , a little boy who got a battery-powered robotic arm last summer , she had made peace with her son wyatt 's limb difference . her premature baby had been born with his right arm tangled in amniotic bands . at a week old , doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand . they were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die . __falardeau__ mourned her boy 's missing arm for years but , in time , embraced her son as he was . wyatt also learned to adapt . they tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months . `` his main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store , '' __falardeau__ wrote on cnn ireport . in truth , she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his __autism-related__ delays -- the limb difference was secondary . so when a friend shared a story from the `` today show '' with wyatt in mind , about a team of university of central florida -lrb- __ucf__ -rrb- students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus , __falardeau__ was defensive . `` he does n't need this , '' she thought . her __fifth-grader__ had a different reaction : `` i want one of these robot arms !

'' said sophomore tyler __petresky__ . `` it 's just one problem after another we keep solving . that 's what engineering is all about . '' the centers for disease control and prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the united states are born with upper limb deformities each year . comprehensive statistics are n't available for the number of children with amputations , such as wyatt . the __ucf__ project started when albert __manero__ , an engineering doctoral student , heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-d printed hand . he got involved with __e-nable__ and met alex , a local boy teased because of his missing arm , and set about designing a robotic replacement . they gave it to alex for free . `` my mother taught us that we 're supposed to help change the world , '' __manero__ said at the time . `` we 're supposed to help make it better . '' the students were blown away by what happened after that . the `` today show '' and other national news outlets featured stories about alex and __manero__ , and then they got international attention . families in more than 25 countries have asked the __ucf__ students to help their children . in february , microsoft highlighted the team in a social media campaign celebrating students using technology to change the world . each electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble . the students use the printer in the school 's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $ 350 -- through donations . __petresky__ got involved with the design of pring 's hand because __manero__ knew he was good with electronics . `` he bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches . i went over to his house and helped him out with electronics , '' he said . `` i found out he was working on an arm , and i thought that was the coolest thing in the world . '' eventually __manero__ moved to germany for a __fulbright__ scholarship and left __petresky__ in charge of running the operations in orlando . __petresky__ says they ask every family about the child 's favorite color , superhero and interests , so the new limb can `` not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them . '' as they 've designed the __bionics__ , they 've learned that kids do n't necessarily want to blend in . children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes , disney 's `` frozen , '' and in wyatt 's case , the __blue-skinned__ men from `` blue man group . '' for christmas , the group upgraded alex 's plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling __optimus__ prime from `` transformers . '' `` we quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal , and much more about expressing yourself , '' __petresky__ said . `` there 's a large aspect of being artistic and being creative . '' the team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including wyatt . he traveled with his mom to __ucf__ last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close . he expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month . his mom , cynthia , was most excited about seeing wyatt being celebrated for who he is . `` the adoration of college students was an affirmation that money ca n't buy . he was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself , '' she wrote in her ireport . `` wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children . '' as they got ready to leave the campus , her son told her he ca n't wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm . and someday , he said , he wants to go to __ucf__ and help other kids like him .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- as a controversy over a racist video continues , the university of oklahoma is announcing a plan to hire a vice president who will oversee diversity programs . a video of a racist chant by the university 's __now-disbanded__ sigma alpha epsilon fraternity made headlines nationwide this week . it shows students on a bus clapping , pumping their fists and laughing as they chant , `` there will never be a ni **** __sae__ . you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me . there will never be a ni **** __sae__ . '' in announcing the new position wednesday night , university president david boren said he decided to make the hire two months ago -- before the video came to light -- and is in talks with an african-american candidate . the school newspaper and a student organization publicized the __nine-second__ video clip after receiving it via anonymous messages . shortly after it surfaced , the university cut ties with sigma alpha epsilon , as did the national fraternity . two students spotted in the video , parker rice and levi pettit , have been expelled for their alleged leadership role in the chant . `` i am deeply sorry for what i did saturday night . it was wrong and reckless , '' rice said tuesday in a statement to the dallas morning news . `` i made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same . '' a statement from pettit 's parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to african-americans , students and university faculty . `` he is a good boy , but what we saw in those videos is disgusting . while it may be difficult for those who only know levi from the video to understand , we know his heart , and he is not a racist , '' brody and susan pettit said . cnn has reached out to both students . a spokesman for the pettit family confirmed that levi pettit was in the video but declined cnn 's request for an interview . boren has ordered a shutdown of the fraternity house in norman , and said it was no longer affiliated with the university . `` livid , just extremely heartbroken , '' jay __vinekar__ , a founder of the university 's __sae__ chapter , told cnn affiliate ktrk . `` i do n't want it in my house , and i do n't want those people to wear my letters , claiming to represent me . the problem is not just a couple of guys on that bus , the problem is that house , it 's a cancer that needs to be cut out . '' local __sae__ alumni apologized on behalf of other members , saying the fraternity has had problems for years . `` the ou __sae__ board of trustees has discovered that a horrible cancer entered into the ou chapter of __sae__ three to four years ago , and was not immediately and totally stopped , '' the organization said in a statement wednesday . `` it should have been . '' the fraternity said it is investigating other incidents involving other chapters that were brought to the attention of its national office . it 's unclear whether more students will be punished for the video . boren has said the fraternity wo n't return during his tenure if he can help it . cnn 's alina machado , tristan smith and steve almasy contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- for those who hoped that the coming presidential election would usher in the dawn of a new , more inspiring politics , this past week has been deeply discouraging . in two key moments , leaders from both sides of the aisle have acted like the __bourbons__ of france , who famously remembered nothing and forgot nothing from battles of their past . the first and __substantively__ more important moment was the sending of that letter by republican senators to the iranian regime . the second , and perhaps more important politically telling moment , was hillary clinton 's handling of her emails . the two cases are oddly related . in both instances , the principals started with legitimate concerns but have wound up making things worse . in both cases , the principals have also created divisive issues that will deepen polarization through the campaign and probably into the next presidency . both have diminished the chances for breaking out of today 's ugly politics . republicans in congress have reason to press hard with their views as negotiations with iran enter the home stretch . they , like many others -- including a sizable number of democrats , the current israeli government , and friendly arab nations -- fear the obama administration will cut a weak , leaky deal that will allow iran to come perilously close to having nuclear weapons . just as importantly , republicans believe , with cause , that as he negotiates , president barack obama has tried to sideline congress in general and them in particular . who can blame them for arguing that if the president insists any agreement needs only executive approval -- not approval by congress -- then the next chief executive should not be legally bound by its provisions ? their basic concerns were not unreasonable . thus , if they had sent exactly the same letter to the president , they would have caused a stir but would have been seen as within the norms of politics and __statecraft__ . instead , they made the mistake -- a wicked one -- of sending it to the terrorist leaders of iran , leaving a clear impression they were out to sabotage both the deal and the president . we have had renegade members of congress try to interfere with presidential negotiations in the past -- remember sen. jesse helms ? -- but never 47 members of the united states senate tossing a hand grenade into delicate , __life-or-death__ negotiations conducted by seven major nations and led by the united states . ayatollah khamenei made clear this week that he may use the republican letter as a pretext for rejecting any deal . where do we go then ? will talks collapse ? will an iranian rush toward the bomb set off a nuclear arms race , starting in saudi arabia , which is already taking preliminary steps ? will the united states then be compelled to use military force against iran ? who knows for sure ? what we do know is that iran is now almost certain to become a central issue in the 2016 presidential campaign and that the republican nominee will be under relentless pressure from the right to adopt a hard , unyielding line . one can just imagine a number of gop candidates pledging that if elected , they will abolish obamacare on day 1 and an iranian agreement on day 2 . this is hardly a way to restore steady , bipartisan foreign policies , as we so badly need . and why have republicans forgotten so soon the damage done from voters thinking the last gop president was too hard line and reckless ? on the other side of the aisle , hillary clinton had absolutely legitimate concerns about the security of emails she might send as secretary of state . as one who spent a year and a half at the clinton white house and state department , i could see first hand how they -- more than any president since nixon -- were hounded by enemies and reporters trying to ferret out secrets to cause trouble or win a prize . it is small wonder that both clintons still have scar tissue . hillary clinton 's mistakes did not start with creating an email protection system . no , they started when she and her team failed to coordinate up front with the state department system and record all official exchanges within the government system on a prompt , __air-tight__ basis . that did not break laws . but it did run afoul of government procedures and , when revealed , naturally gave rise to suspicions about what she might be hiding . in her press conference , she did accomplish her obvious mission : she began cutting legs off the story . in essence , she said one half of her emails -lrb- the official ones -rrb- are now safely with the state department and , at her request , will gradually be made public . the other half -lrb- who knows what 's in there ? -rrb- have been deleted and she is keeping the server . in effect , she says , they are gone ... and gone forever , beyond congressional subpoena , __foia__ requests , and even hackers . what fresh revelations can the press now pursue ? not many . and how can republicans __browbeat__ her in hearings without looking like bullies ? hard to do . in short , the story may soon die . you just have to trust me , she says . clever . but the very fact that instead of inviting a neutral , trusted party like lee hamilton to review all the emails , she chose to cut off the story by destroying the evidence comes with a price : she has freshly renewed public doubts whether she plays straight or by her own rules . loyal democrats will continue to invest their faith in her , but for many others , the controversy leaves a lingering sense of unease . and polarization deepens . she was always going to face a rough campaign , but now she will begin with clouds already gathering . more to the point , they will obscure her very real strengths as a leader . around the world , many women look upon her with heartfelt admiration from her years of promoting their empowerment . and she has also has a strong case to make that she and her husband know something about job creation : __22.9__ million were created in the eight clinton years , more than in any other presidency since world war ii -lrb- reagan was second at __16.1__ million ; there have been some 6.4 million in the first six obama years . -rrb- . in short , she is worse off than she was before this controversy broke -- and so are american politics . bill clinton likes to say that politics is always about tomorrow -- and he is right . but candidates also need to remember and learn from yesterday . after this last week , they might start by reading a wonderful book by historian barbara tuchman published some 30 years ago : `` the march of folly : from troy to vietnam . '' there she argues that leaders often start out trying to do the right thing but take a wrong path , stubbornly stick with it despite all evidence and eventually wreck . tuchman calls their refusal to learn from experience `` __wooden-headedness__ '' . we have seen too much __wooden-headedness__ these past days .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- i grew up watching `` leave it to beaver . '' most episodes , ward cleaver would come home from work in his suit and tie and there would be his wife june , always in the kitchen , her apron as white as the picket fence outside . june made dinner , of course , and ward and wally and the __beav__ sat at the table and ate . as i recall , june usually cleaned up . maybe once or twice the boys helped with dishes . maybe . i would watch the black and white show during dinner , sitting on the couch with a plate of food on my lap that had not been prepared by my own mother . my mother was in her generation 's first cohort of `` working moms . '' she had a successful career as an executive at at&t and then __lucent__ technologies . she left for work early each morning , but was always home by five or six -- in time to spend time with me , not to cook . my dad also had a full-time job , and across the entirety of my life , i do n't recall him so much as opening a can of soup . he 's only recently learned to use the microwave . both my parents worked equally hard , but there was no doubt when i was growing up that cooking was my mom 's responsibility -- even if that meant buying prepared meals from the allentown farmer 's market , __spooning__ it onto plates , pressing `` power '' then `` start . '' in other words , as i ate my dinner in the 1980s while watching a tv show based on life in the 1950s , it was easy to see that some things had changed and some had not . life inside the house -- food , dishes , cleaning , tidying , clothing , hygiene -- was my mom 's responsibility , just as it was june cleaver 's . outside the house -- the lawn , the cars , anything made or stored in the garage , sports , bike riding -- that was my dad 's domain . and to be clear , when the car would break down , it was a big deal , but one that came up far less frequently than our need for meals and laundry . this daily labor weighed more on my mother . sociologist __arlie__ russell __hochschild__ coined this the `` second shift '' : how even though more and more women started working outside the home , they were still expected to do the same amount of domestic work at the end of the day . studies say that when it comes to fair division of household labor , gay couples , like my partner and i , generally do a better job . unfettered by the ready expectations of traditional gender roles , same-sex couples `` are more likely than members of heterosexual couples to negotiate a balance between achieving a fair distribution of household labor and accommodating the different interests , skills , and work schedules of particular partners , '' wrote social scientist lawrence k. __kurdek__ . in fact , after a __no-doubt__ bumpy period of adjustment -lrb- __editorializing__ from personal experience here -rrb- , __kurdek__ wrote , `` this pattern of negotiation holds true even when couples have children living with them . '' in my own family , my partner does most of the laundry , though to be fair that 's partly because she 's picky about what 's washed on what cycle and what gets hung to dry , versus tossed in the dryer . on weekends , she does most of the cooking -- because , she 's a better cook and enjoys it more . but i 'm faster , so i end up cooking breakfast and dinner most of the weekdays . about 99 % of the time , if our bed is made it 's because sarah did it . and 99 % of the time , if the dishes are washed , it 's because i washed them . sarah likes to buy groceries because i have a bad habit of buying massive quantities of things we do n't need . and she buys our daughter 's clothing -lrb- same reason -rrb- . i pay the bills and do our taxes . on weekends and after school we take turns ferrying our 6-year-old to and from activities and play dates . what , you 're wondering , about other traditional `` male '' gender roles in our __male-less__ family ? admittedly , i more often wear pants more than my partner and i more often take on these tasks . when our car breaks , i take it to the mechanic . i load the car up for trips . i put crap in the basement . i __smush__ __millipedes__ . i fix the leaky sink . but i also sew my daughter 's halloween costume every year and sew on buttons when they fall off . our same-sex family has not so much created new gender role arrangements , but __deconstructed__ such arrangements altogether . i get to __smush__ __millipedes__ and sew costumes , not because of my chromosomes or some __pre-determined__ gender role , but because i enjoy doing so . while i now pay most of our bills online , i find it unbelievably gratifying to put a check in the actual mail . i have a giant , eclectic pile of postage stamps for this reason . it should be noted that the experience of gender roles is highly defined by class . what my partner and i have in common with my parents is the financial ability to have additional help , including , in our case , regular __babysitters__ and a weekly house cleaner . what 's more , any conversation about household gender roles would be incomplete without noting that some __upper-middle__ class americans pay their domestic workers so painfully little that these workers -- predominantly immigrant women of color -- ca n't afford to put healthy food on their own families ' tables , if they even have time to cook between __cobbling__ jobs together to make ends meet . meanwhile studies show that in working-class straight couples , even where the women work outside the home and the men do n't , women still do a disproportionate amount of housework . it seems that in too many situations , no matter the configuration , women are getting screwed . this is partly why __leanin.org__ today launched __#leanintogether__ , a public service campaign in partnership with the national basketball association and the women 's national basketball association emphasizing how men benefit from equality and providing practical tips for men to do their part at home and at work . the campaign encourages men to `` show the world they 're for equality '' and women to `` celebrate men leaning in for equality '' by posting with the hashtag __#leanintogether__ . __patriarchy__ is not the fault of all men , but it is the responsibility of all men to do something about it . after all , whether you want to blame biology or early economic incentives or the cultural indoctrination of `` leave it to beaver , '' men have consistently failed to do their fair share of household labor in america . the solution ? more gay households or even __sister-wife-type__ scenarios alone wo n't transform household gender roles . we have to value household work as work , which means everything from paying domestic workers __livable__ wages to more men cleaning and cooking and teaching their sons that doing so is honorable and equitable , not demeaning . while fairness in gender roles has improved since the era of june and ward , the subtle and __not-so-subtle__ __inequities__ are still a mess . men need to shift from expecting or enforcing traditional gender roles to becoming role models for more equitable relationships . in other words , clean it up , fellas -- literally and __figuratively__ .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- this weekend marked the official opening of `` fish in the dark , '' the broadway debut of larry david of `` seinfeld '' and `` curb your enthusiasm '' fame . of course , the odd conventions of live theater mean that `` fish '' was n't quite __fresh-to-table__ at its premiere : it 's been playing for several weeks now to sold-out preview crowds , to build buzz and iron out production kinks . and sold out really means sold out : the show has destroyed box office records for the vintage __cort__ theatre and might yet set new ones for a __nonmusical__ despite its limited run . that 's because david has a huge built-in audience for his unique brand of humor , which `` curb '' fans know to be as abrasive as sea salt and as __astringent__ as lemon , unyielding in the face of social __niceties__ , epic humiliation or even common human decency . it 's polarizing , and the poles are pretty clearly drawn : by and large , fans of david 's work tend to loudly proclaim that as long as abuse is sprayed __pari__ __passu__ -- e.g. , __proportionately__ in all directions -- no one should take offense . the __nonfans__ tend to respond that this kind of comedy rests on an assumption defined by another common latin phrase , __ceteris__ __paribus__ -- e.g. , `` all other things being equal . '' and all other things are never equal in our world , by definition . when a group of affluent white protagonists in an almost exclusively white `` new york '' behave badly toward a handful of cartoonish parodies of working-class ethnic __nobodies__ -lrb- a pretty fair __synopsis__ of many `` seinfeld '' episodes -rrb- , it 's hilarious if you belong to the former category . it 's much less so when you belong to the latter . so it 's not entirely surprising that some of the whispered early concerns with `` fish '' related to the character of __fabiana__ , the puerto rican maid of the late patriarch of david 's fictional family , the __drexels__ . __fabiana__ , played by rosie perez , and her son diego play a pivotal part in the show , which takes place in the immediate wake -lrb- er , shiva ? -rrb- of the passing of the elder drexel ; without spoiling the plot , suffice it to say that it hinges on __upstairs-downstairs__ romantic antics and their inevitable consequences . and yes , some reviewers are using the `` r '' - word in calling out the depiction of __fabiana__ , __eye-rolling__ over __yashdasm__ -lrb- yet another stereotypical hispanic domestic and single mom -rrb- whose comic function is largely to __mispronounce__ words and make cultural stumbles like bringing __cuchifritos__ to a jewish memorial service . but the conversation about race and representation is n't , and should n't be , __absolutist__ based on content ; context is just as important -- perhaps more so . what 's the __threeway__ balance of power between the author , the actors and the intended audience ? are a performance 's questionable aspects racially __exceptionalized__ ? does the role pivot on the ethnic identity of the characters and performers in a way that prevents them from being seen as more than just the color of their skin and the accent of their speech ? and finally , is the vehicle in which it 's taking place innovative , eye-opening , __horizon-expanding__ , or does it reduce , __repress__ and restrict ? as `` fish '' was finishing its preview run , a __theater-world__ drama of another color was erupting nearby . the national asian artists project , a nonprofit theater company that produces works from the traditional broadway canon featuring __all-asian__ casts , had announced its next production would be a big-budget , asian american adaptation of jerome kern and oscar __hammerstein__ ii 's `` show boat , '' to be developed and directed by broadway __wunderkind__ tommy tune . the problem , as asian american actor and blogger erin __quill__ immediately called out , is that unlike __naap__ 's prior projects , which have included shows such as `` oliver ! '' and `` carousel , '' `` show boat '' is set in the deep south , among the laborers and performers working on and about the cotton blossom , a __paddleboat__ theater offering entertainment to audiences up and down the mississippi . `` this show ... is about the great racial divides within the deep south -- divides that are , without question , black and white , '' wrote __quill__ . '' -lsb- asians -rsb- were not ` toting that barge ' or ` lifting that bale ' . asian americans were not recovering from being ripped from their homeland and bound in chains due to the color of their skin . it is not ` our ' story to tell . '' the fundamental mission of __naap__ and other theatrical companies that cast productions against type is twofold : they seek to showcase overlooked talent and to challenge the racial conventions of the aptly dubbed `` great white way , '' disrupting the notion that __phenotypic__ reference points are necessary for a performer to __believably__ portray a role . in that latter context , they 're exercises designed to highlight the fundamental magic of live theater : its power to get audiences to suspend disbelief . __naap__ 's __all-asian__ `` show boat '' would seem to be not very different from the public theater 's present production of `` hamilton , '' featuring a multiracial set of american founding fathers -- including puerto rican author and composer __lin-manuel__ miranda as the titular hamilton and african american actor leslie odom jr. as his rival , aaron burr . and yet , there is a fundamental difference . having actors of color play characters written for white actors , who are cast in 79 % of all broadway roles -lrb- by contrast , asian americans and hispanics are cast in just 3 % each and african americans in 14 % -rrb- , is an act of disruptive defiance . having actors of color play characters written for other actors of color is shuffling deck chairs on the titanic at best and at worst , a categorically ill-conceived recipe for insensitivity . could __naap__ have weathered the spectacle of asian performers speaking in southern black dialect , performing a plot that 's entirely dependent on black history ? could an asian steve have cut an asian julie 's hand , sucking her blood , then declared defiantly to an asian sheriff that if julie was a `` __mulatto__ , '' so was he , because he now had `` black blood '' in him ? after a contentious town hall , in which numerous other performers of varied race and background expressed their __vehement__ doubts , the asian american theatrical community , and ultimately __naap__ as well , decided it could n't . the context of the show , and the charged climate it would be arriving in , would make its content impossible to swallow . __naap__ canceled the production . the costs of the cancellation are n't known , but they clearly are n't insignificant . but what , by contrast , of `` fish '' ? the reality is that __fabiana__ -lrb- performed by rosie perez more or less as rosie perez -rrb- does n't stand out as offensive when compared with the rest of the play 's characters ; for that matter , there 's nothing inherently hispanic about the role , which , if the show had an unlimited run , could easily be __recast__ as asian , black or white , losing very little in the process . by contrast , nearly all of the rest of the cast fit familiar comedic portrayals of jewish family members -- most intensely so , the neurotic protagonist , norman -lrb- performed by larry david himself more or less as larry david -rrb- . the truth is , if __non-jews__ were to put on a production of `` fish in the dark , '' it would be difficult not to experience it as anti-semitic . these are the new and fascinating challenges presented by pop culture in our era of surging diversity , and they 're coming fast and furious from every direction . interesting times and sure to get more interesting still .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- a video appears online . in it , fraternity members from your university are chanting a hateful , racist song about lynching african-americans . the video goes viral . you 're president of the university . imagine being in that situation . what would you do ? there are two ways to answer the question . the first is in the moment of crisis . the second is about the long term . as most everyone knows by now , david boren , president of the university of oklahoma , faced just this situation monday . and i 've been thinking about it intensely , not only because i care about race and civic leadership in america , but also because boren was my first boss , when he was a u.s. senator . i 'm not from oklahoma but ended up working for boren through a college internship . he was a mentor to me during my years in washington , and a model for me when he left the beltway to be of greater use and service as an educator . though we have n't talked since the crisis broke , i see familiar patterns of leadership . boren responded to the crisis swiftly , with a statement that went viral . boren told the students from sigma alpha epsilon -lrb- __sae__ -rrb- he had a message for them : `` you are disgraceful . you have violated all that we stand for . you should not have the privilege of calling yourselves __sooners__ '' -lrb- the ou nickname -rrb- . boren went on to sever all ties between ou and __sae__ . the national fraternity closed the local chapter . later , boren said he 'd be glad if the students in the video left campus because `` we do n't provide student services for bigots . '' the next day he expelled two of them . his actions have resonated across the country . on social media , people shocked by the video find themselves also stunned by boren 's response . why ? because he did something rare in public life today . he expressed a decisive , judgmental view with moral clarity . then he followed through . his statements have been free of mushy __lawyer-talk__ or euphemism . he 's led __authentically__ , from the heart . of course , people have __carped__ . some question whether boren has the legal authority , as head of a public institution , to expel students on the basis of their free speech , even racist hate speech . some lament that what he should have branded as disgraceful was the students ' actions , not the students themselves . legitimate concerns , perhaps . the first amendment question , certainly , is being debated by legal scholars . but these concerns are eclipsed by the bigger picture . boren was n't just condemning __wrongdoers__ ; he was shifting social norms for all . a __cynic__ might consider laughable a refrain from boren 's statement about `` real __sooners__ . '' boren said that real __sooners__ are not racists or bigots ; they believe in equal opportunity , treat people with mutual respect and love each other like family . a __cynic__ might say oklahoma is a state both very white and very red , not known for flying the banner of anti-racism . indeed , the original __sooners__ were the white settlers who raced in to claim land that had been wrested from native americans . but the point of boren 's `` real __sooners__ '' riff is not to describe or __sanitize__ today 's reality ; it is to issue a challenge . it is to bind people to a creed , a standard of being and belief that is easy to assert but hard to achieve . not unlike being a true patriot . so now begins the longer term . here , another opportunity arises to lead by example . david boren can now examine the institution he works for and ask how and why such attitudes and behaviors -- racism so casually vicious -- could ever take root among people as young as freshmen . he can explore the ways in which everyone -- not only the obviously guilty parties at a frat party -- is touched by unconscious bias and institutional racism . he can now ask his community to face the __inequities__ of history and race . we can all do that . howard schultz , ceo of starbucks , is doing this at his company . he was moved after the incidents of ferguson and staten island to hold truly open forums with employees about the pain and anguish of racial division . but you do n't have to be a college president or a ceo . you do n't have to be a white man in charge to start a tough reckoning with racism -lrb- though it 'd help if more did -rrb- . whoever you are , you can start a new kind of conversation in your neighborhood . on your campus . at your house of worship . ask what the history is . ask why there are such imbalances of power and voice . ask what it would take to be truly inclusive . then , in word and deed , start answering your own questions . we can all do that . the sooner , the better .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- a federal judge has ordered the defense department to release photos that allegedly show detainees being abused in detention centers in iraq and afghanistan during the bush administration . the photos wo n't be made public right away . in an order issued friday , u.s. district judge alvin k. __hellerstein__ of the southern district of new york granted the government 60 days to appeal . the aclu sued the defense department in 2003 to have the photos made public . it 's not clear how many photos are involved or where the pictures were taken , but in an august opinion __hellerstein__ said the government acknowledged having at least 29 pictures from at least seven different locations in afghanistan and iraq and may have hundreds or thousands more . some of the photos may have come from the notorious abu ghraib prison in iraq . in 2004 , photos became public that showed american soldiers abusing abu ghraib detainees and putting them into humiliating sexual positions . people in the mideast and americans were outraged and shocked by the photos , which added to the national debate on the use of torture in the war on terror . __hellerstein__ said the government failed to prove its argument that releasing the photos would endanger american soldiers or civilians overseas . in july 2011 , the judge blocked release of the photos at the urging of the secretary of defense because u.s. troops were still fighting in iraq . by december 2011 , most u.s. ground troops had withdrawn from iraq , the judge wrote , and he did n't know whether release of the photos would affect military operations . `` three years is a long time in war , the news cycle and the international debate over how to respond to terrorism , '' he wrote . the judge also said the government failed to convince him a collective review of the photos met the requirements of the protected national security documents act . the aclu argued the defense department must individually review each photo and explain why its release would put americans in danger . __jameel__ __jaffer__ , aclu deputy legal director , said in a statement that the photos are `` the best evidence of what took place in the military 's detention centers , and their disclosure would help the public better understand the implications of some of the bush administration 's policies . '' a response by the pentagon to the judge 's decision was not immediately available . the pentagon has refused to release the photos requested by the aclu , saying publication could endanger american soldiers and civilians overseas . several u.s. military leaders who saw some of the pictures made that argument in a december 19 filing in the lawsuit . they pointed to public demonstrations in mideast countries that followed reports of quran __burnings__ , the release of the video `` innocence of the muslims '' and the 2012 release of a video that showed americans soldiers urinating on dead enemy combatants . navy rear adm. sinclair harris of the joint chiefs of staff said islamist extremist groups like isis use `` imagery associated with united states detention practices '' as part of their recruiting efforts . the aclu responded by saying the military leaders did n't see all the photos , just a sampling selected by an army lawyer . the aclu also said the leaders did n't explain how the photos were `` similarly inflammatory . '' their prediction of anti-american violence was only speculation , the aclu said . `` to allow the government to suppress any image that might provoke someone , somewhere , to violence would be to give the government sweeping power to suppress evidence of its own agents ' misconduct , '' __jaffer__ of the aclu said .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- a well-heeled employer goes back to his hotel after a hard -lrb- __ish__ -rrb- day 's work and finds no hot dinner on the table . he snaps , lashing out -lrb- allegedly -rrb- at the nearest __underling__ who could be held responsible . within days , almost 1 million people sign a petition for him not to lose his job , while the suspension of the tv program he presents loses the bbc 4 million viewers . why is this man so popular that he can be accused of abusing his staff -lrb- not to mention members of other ethnic groups and nationalities -rrb- and seemingly get away with it ? a serial offender , jeremy clarkson seems to enjoy a charmed life . but , with the bbc now deliberating over his future , has his luck finally run out ? not a chance . clarkson , like so many celebrities , sees his stock grow with every controversy . every indiscretion seems calculated to raise his profile and boost his esteem among his fervent followers that little bit further . the `` __eeny__ , __meeny__ , __miny__ , moe '' incident , which saw the n-word slip out -- whoops , did i really hear what i think i heard ? -- was designed to achieve just the right effect : offensive enough to generate howls of protest , but trivial enough for his fans to spring to his defense , crying `` __over-reaction__ '' and `` storm in a __teacup__ . '' the presenter later apologized , saying his efforts to obscure the offending word `` were n't quite good enough . '' on this latest occasion , was it the beleaguered producer lodging a complaint , or , like any normal person who 's been punched in the face by a thug , pressing charges with the local constabulary ? no , it was none other than clarkson who willingly gave himself up to the corporation . go on , sack me , he seemed to be saying , when he told a reporter that his dismissal `` is coming , is n't it ? '' see how my adoring public likes that . former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and chelsea manager jose mourinho are , like clarkson , seasoned experts in rebranding themselves -lrb- or their team -rrb- as the victims , even when they seem to have everything going for them bar the position of the stars . they have all perfected the glum , __hangdog__ expression that invites sympathy , begging forgiveness for each misdemeanour . it makes their success all the sweeter if they can convince us that they achieved it in the face of hostility . while waiting for the bbc to deliver its verdict , clarkson penned an article for the sun in which he likened himself to a `` dinosaur '' whose time is about to run out , knowing full well that his followers will protest : no , of course you 're not washed up and irrelevant , jeremy . britain needs you to stand up to johnny foreigner ! it is almost tempting to wonder whether there might be a political role ahead of him should the beeb decide to give him the push for once and for all -lrb- i use the word `` political '' __advisedly__ here -rrb- . the romans had a goddess , __fama__ , who __fanfared__ both good and bad deeds for all eternity . badly behaved celebrities have their __trumpets__ blown by the massed forces of the media , which are of course only too pleased to have such good copy . clarkson is already assured of immortality , if only through youtube or its futuristic equivalent , but while waiting to shuffle off this mortal coil he -- like all celebrities -- acts as a conduit of __divinity__ . he is the chain that binds the earthly audience to the goddess __fama__ , and this is why we allow him to act in such a __beastly__ way , without complaining -lrb- too much -rrb- . in the east of india , holy intermediaries called __kalasis__ beat devotees with canes . the devotees flinch with the mortal pain , but they receive it as a blessing . contestants on the x factor queue all night for the opportunity to be verbally abused by simon cowell . bruises , actual and emotional , are worn with pride , whether delivered by the __kalasis__ cane , cowell 's tongue , or clarkson 's fist -lrb- allegedly -rrb- . they are blessed that are touched by celebrity . so how about __oisin__ __tymon__ , clarkson 's hapless producer , who , according to the daily telegraph , had to seek hospital treatment for a cut lip following the `` fracas ? '' had he presented poor , weary jeremy with a nice __succulent__ steak on his arrival that evening , he would still be languishing in the realms of the unknown . and do n't feel sorry for the hotel owner either : just watch bookings at __simonstone__ hall , the yorkshire hotel where the alleged incident took place , go through the roof . they may as well start engraving that blue plaque now .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- a pennsylvania state university fraternity has been suspended after allegedly posting on a private facebook page compromising photos of women , including some who appeared to be asleep or passed out . the suspension of kappa delta __rho__ -lrb- __kdr__ -rrb- fraternity comes as state college police as well as university officials investigate the fraternity 's alleged use of the online page with up to 144 active members , including current and former students . `` no arrests are being made at this time , '' state college police lt. keith robb said . `` unfortunately , we are n't able to identify any suspects right now because the accounts on facebook were sanitized , wiped clean . '' robb said it has not yet been determined if any crime occurred . in a statement , college administrators said the fraternity 's local chapter had been suspended for one year by the penn state __interfraternity__ council and that police and university officials were investigating . the statement said the fraternity used the private facebook page to post `` highly inappropriate photographs ... of activities and events that are in direct violation of the standards and values of a recognized student organization at penn state . '' the images allegedly included nude and partially nude women -- some seemed to pose , others appeared incapacitated . `` the evidence offered by the facebook postings is appalling , offensive and inconsistent with the university community 's values and expectations , '' the statement said . penn state university president eric barron said in a separate statement wednesday that the university will work with kappa delta __rho__ 's national headquarters to determine whether the fraternity should be reinstated . the university is also considering whether fraternities will continue at penn state , barron said . `` it ... brings us to a point where we must ask if a __re-evaluation__ of the fraternity system is required , '' he said . `` some members of the university senior leadership believe it is , and we are considering our options . '' david __clohessy__ , director of the st. __louis-based__ survivors network of those abused by priests , or snap , said in a statement that the latest allegations call into question the university 's handling of sex crime reports . `` for years now , penn state enthusiasts have repeatedly reassured everyone who 'd listen that the university 's problematic culture about sex crimes had been ` reformed , '' __clohessy__ said . `` the latest allegations -- that fraternity members posted nude pictures of women on facebook , some of whom appeared to be sleeping or passed out -- raise serious doubts about those claims . '' in 2012 , former penn state assistant football coach jerry sandusky was convicted on 45 counts of sexually molesting boys and sentenced to a 30 - to 60-year prison term . sandusky , who has maintained his innocence , is appealing . `` the kappa delta __rho__ is a wake-up call , '' __clohessy__ said . `` but the sandusky case should have been a wake-up call too . '' a former member of kappa delta __rho__ alerted police to the page , telling them in january that it had been used by members to share photos of `` unsuspecting victims , drug sales and hazing , '' according to a copy of a police affidavit . the drugs allegedly included `` marijuana and edibles , concentrates , add medication , and some cocaine , '' the affidavit said . the former frat member who tipped off police told authorities that a second facebook page called `` 2.0 '' allegedly had been created around april 2014 following complaints from a woman whose photo was posted on it , the affidavit said . the earlier version of the page was titled `` covert business transactions . '' rape , nude photos , racist behavior : do fraternities make men behave badly ? the __ex-frat__ member told police that the victim was visiting the fraternity when she saw a topless photo of herself after a member accidentally left his facebook page logged in , the affidavit said . the affidavit included photos of women and screen shots of cellphone text exchanges , including one from a woman who allegedly had no recollection of a sexual encounter and whether birth control was used . in the sandusky case , the sensational trial featured the testimony of eight young men who said they were sexually abused by sandusky -- either groped in a car , __soaped__ by him in the shower or sexually assaulted on a basement __waterbed__ . the scandal gripped the nation and ended a torturous chapter for the victims and penn state 's vaunted football program , including the dismissal of the late legendary coach joe paterno and one of america 's highest-paid university presidents , graham spanier . it also tarnished penn state 's celebrated reputation in collegiate athletics . `` we hope that penn state officials will stop patting themselves on the back and start instituting real reforms to make the campus safer for students , '' said __clohessy__ , whose group includes members who were allegedly molested by religious figures of all denominations . attempts to reach the university and __interfraternity__ council were unsuccessful . cnn 's laura ly and sara __ganim__ contributed to this report .

'' history , they say , is written by the victors , and according to the __tudors__ and their most famous playwright , richard was __hunchbacked__ , with a withered hand and limping gait , `` deformed , unfinished ... and that so __lamely__ and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them . '' for the archaeologists searching for richard 's remains , the sight of the __freshly-uncovered__ skeleton 's twisted spine was the moment the hairs began to stand up on the back of their necks ; tests later revealed the king suffered from __idiopathic__ __adolescent-onset__ scoliosis . but while the skeleton 's curved vertebrae are striking , experts say the resulting disability would not have been obvious in richard iii when he was alive . it would have meant his right shoulder was slightly higher than the other , but this was likely disguised by clothing , and so only apparent to the king 's closest family and __confidantes__ . read more : richard iii 's spine twisted , not hunched . the most famous portraits of richard iii depict him as dark-haired and steely eyed , but they were painted some 25 to 30 years after his death , and dna tests on the remains suggest they are far from accurate . genetic specialist __turi__ king , from the university of leicester , said analysis of various genetic markers offered clues to the king 's appearance , suggesting he was actually fair haired and had blue eyes . '' -lsb- there are -rsb- genes that we know are involved in coding for hair and eye color , '' she told cnn in december 2014 . `` the genetic evidence shows he had a 96 % probability of having blue eyes , and a 77 % probability of having blond hair , though this can __darken__ with age .

'' when archaeologists studied the remains unearthed in leicester , they found evidence of 11 of wounds inflicted at or around the time of his death : nine to his skull and two to other parts of his body . the position of the injuries suggest that richard had lost both his horse and his helmet when he was set upon by opposition troops . `` the most likely injuries to have caused the king 's death are the two to the inferior aspect of the skull -- a large sharp force trauma possibly from a sword or staff weapon , such as a __halberd__ or bill , and a penetrating injury from the tip of an edged weapon , '' said professor guy __rutty__ , who said the wounds were consistent with accounts of what happened to him at bosworth . tests also found an injury to the inside of richard iii 's pelvis which supports contemporary reports that his body was subjected to acts of ritual humiliation after his death . read more : richard iii 's fatal wounds revealed .

'' ... receiving the love from the crowd here , it really meant a lot to me . '' the bnp paribas open in indian wells , just east of palm desert , california , is n't a grand slam but is one of the top tournaments in tennis . as such , top players go there to battle the best and prove their mettle . that 's what brought serena williams to indian wells in 2001 . the __then-19-year-old__ got to the finals after her scheduled semifinal foe -- sister venus -- pulled out minutes before the matching , citing a knee injury . amid whispers he 'd predetermined the outcome , richard williams told usa today that he `` had trouble holding back tears '' given the treatment he got in the stands . according to him , one man said , `` i wish it was ' 75 , we 'd skin you alive .

'' -lrb- i drove -rrb- back to los angeles feeling as if i had lost the biggest game ever -- not a mere tennis game but a bigger fight for equality , '' serena williams wrote in time magazine in february . `` emotionally it seemed easier to stay away . '' serena speaks about nerves before 1st match back at indian wells . the roller-coaster ride back to indian wells started when williams accepted a __wild-card__ invitation to play in this year 's tournament , a difficult decision she recounted in time . her father and sister , venus , still stayed away . while she 's been on her sport 's biggest stage for well over a decade , the world 's no. __1-ranked__ played admitted being nervous in the weeks , days and hours leading to her opening match . those feelings broke out in the open as she walked onto the court , a response she called `` overwhelming '' and said she `` was n't really prepared for . '' the match itself was n't easy , either . __romanian-born__ monica __niculescu__ , the world 's __68th-ranked__ player , challenged her for more than two hours . still , williams managed to overcome her competitor and her emotions to win in straight sets , 7-5 , 7-5 . declining to reflect on the past , williams simply said afterward , `` today was a wonderful day for me , for women 's tennis , ... for tennis in general , and for everyone . '' the 33-year-old still has a lot of matches ahead of her . that includes more at indian wells , whose talented field includes maria sharapova and caroline wozniacki . still , for all her competitive fire , williams is n't feeling much pressure to win . she feels like she has already won . `` i do n't feel like i actually have to hold the trophy at the end of this , '' she said . `` i feel like i 'm already holding the trophy . and i 've never felt this way .

'' it is `` incredibly rare to happen in the middle of the flight , '' he said , meaning the pilot would have to act fast . contrary to some early reports , the french civil aviation authority told cnn that the crew of the __germanwings__ plane did not issue a distress call . it was air traffic controllers who sent out a distress call after radio contact with the plane was lost . the lack of an emergency call can raise a red flag to a __nonpilot__ . why would a pilot not alert someone that there is an emergency ? does it hint to an incursion in the cockpit or a pilot 's motives ? it might sound __counterintuitive__ , but calling for help is not the first thing on a pilot 's checklist when things go wrong . __soucie__ said the principle that a pilot follows during an emergency is this : __aviate__ , navigate and communicate . in other words , before turning on a distress call or transponder , the pilot 's first concern is to fly the plane , and secondly , to find the safest option for a crash landing , if it comes to that . the __germanwings__ pilot `` was definitely __aviating__ and navigating from what we can tell , '' __soucie__ said . the pilot was conceivably looking for a place to try to land , he said . a distress call -- had it happened -- could have signaled a different story . schiavo explained that there are codes that pilots have -- certain words that if uttered by the pilot indicate to air traffic controllers that there is a hijacking . the initial reports are that there was no hijack code transmitted from the plane . a big part of determining the cause of the crash will be whether such a code was sent or not . `` i do n't think you 'd rule anything out at this point , '' cnn aviation analyst miles o'brien said . `` it 's not like it appears as if it was an in-flight breakup . so what was going on in the cockpit is what we 're going to be talking about in the coming days . '' o'brien pointed out the known details of the crash -- a rapid descent , no radio call and a flight that continues into the mountains -- are not part of a `` typical emergency scenario . '' there were no reported weather issues during the plane 's flight , but that does not mean you can rule these out as a possible cause , pilot and cnn aviation analyst les __abend__ said . one thing __abend__ was looking at was a cold front progressing in the area where the plane was . it indicated some precipitation at lower altitudes . so there may not have been bad weather at the cruising altitude , but `` at lower altitudes , as they were beginning the descent , their visibility may have been obscured , '' __abend__ said . reduced visibility in and of itself is not a huge issue , but the weather may have deteriorated as the plane descended and be a possible factor in the crash , he said .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     cnn aviation analyst says this is not a typical emergency incident , but all possibilities are part of probe . the cause behind the crash of the __germanwings__ plane is unknown . there are early clues , however , that will be key to investigators .

'' her husband , oscar-winning actor brad pitt , was on a plane back from france within hours , she wrote . `` the beautiful thing about such moments in life is that there is so much clarity . you know what you live for and what matters . it is polarizing , and it is peaceful , '' she wrote . further tests came back negative for tumors , jolie wrote . `` there was still a chance of early stage cancer , but that was minor compared with a full-blown tumor . to my relief , i still had the option of removing my ovaries and fallopian tubes and i chose to do it . '' jolie stresses that not all women with the same brca1 gene mutation should feel they must automatically leap to surgery , but she urges them to explore their options and take control . her family history -- she lost her grandmother and aunt to cancer , as well as her mother -- combined with the gene mutation meant that in her case , the removal of her ovaries and fallopian tubes seemed the best course . while not as complex as the mastectomy surgery , its effects are more severe , jolie said , since it puts a woman into forced menopause . she must now take estrogen and progesterone in order to keep a hormonal balance . she will not be able to have more children and __foresees__ physical changes , she said . but jolie acknowledged she was lucky because she already has a family , unlike some women who face this difficult decision . `` it is not possible to remove all risk , and the fact is i remain prone to cancer , '' she said . `` i will look for natural ways to strengthen my immune system . i feel feminine , and grounded in the choices i am making for myself and my family . i know my children will never have to say , ` mom died of ovarian cancer .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- serena williams had a big decision to make earlier this year , and she wanted to run it by her parents . she was nervous . she wanted to see whether they would support her going back to indian wells , california , to play in a tournament she had skipped 13 times since winning in 2001 . the last time she was there , she had been booed loudly and __lustfully__ . the fans were upset and sensed some sort of conspiracy that she did n't have to face her talented older sister in the semifinals . venus williams had withdrawn 10 minutes before their match with a knee injury . many fans did n't buy it and thought it was orchestrated to give the younger williams a chance for extra rest . two days later , during the championship match , serena williams , 19 at the time , was jeered when she did well and cheered when she fared poorly . then days after the tournament , which she won , her father , richard , told usa today that as he and venus walked down the stairs to their seats , people kept calling him the n-word and one man said : `` i wish it was ' 75 ; we 'd skin you alive . '' neither serena nor venus has played in the tennis tournament since . that will end friday when serena williams , the world no. 1 , faces monica __niculescu__ , the __68th-ranked__ player in a second-round match . the end of the boycott took a lot of conversations with a lot of people , williams told reporters thursday . two of the most important were with her parents . `` it was a really emotional time for me , '' she said , saying the prospect of the talks made her a little nervous . she told them she would n't go back if they did n't want her to go . but they both said to play . her dad said it would be a big mistake not to come back , she said . williams said her mother said , `` i will be there for you . '' venus williams , the no. 11 singles player , is n't playing in the tournament , but serena williams said her older sister was 100 % behind her . she is `` very happy that i am here . and even encouraged me to come , '' serena williams said . serena williams announced her return to the event in a time magazine first-person piece in february , writing she would ended her boycott in the spirit of forgiveness . she said thursday that she did n't just have to forgive the fans at indian wells . `` in order to forgive , you have to be able to really let go of everything . i kind of let go a long time ago , and i kind of forgave , but i was n't at point where i was ready to come back , '' she said . the timing seemed right this year , she said . she added that she will be a little nervous in her first match at the bnp paribas open . still she was `` looking forward actually to kind of stepping out on center court and letting the whole world know that it does n't matter what you face -- whether it 's something that was n't right , something that hurt you , hurt your family . you can just come out and be strong . '' cnn 's chris borg and tom mcgowan contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- last summer , amid startling news reports of manipulation , mismanagement and possibly death caused by failures at the department of veterans affairs , congress came together and passed legislation to overhaul veterans ' access to health care . i was proud to sponsor the veterans access , choice and accountability act of 2014 -lrb- the choice act -rrb- , and deliver good news to veterans : they would have a choice when it comes to accessing health care they deserve , and many would have the option of seeing their local physician . now , the va is trying to take the choice away . a mere six months after the choice act was signed into law , and only three months after veterans began to receive their choice cards , the president 's budget attempts to __reallocate__ the law 's emergency funds that are solely meant to pay for veterans ' health care in their communities . the va says these funds are n't being used quickly enough because veterans are n't interested in getting care from their local physicians . that could not be further from the truth . thousands of veterans are struggling to access the care they were promised through the choice act because of the va 's flawed implementation of the law and foolish interpretation of the __40-mile__ rule in the distance criteria . when congress passed the choice act , the intent was that veterans be allowed to access local health care if they can not receive the va care they need within 40 miles of their home , or their wait time for an appointment is more than 30 days . unfortunately , the va decided to narrow the interpretation of the __40-mile__ rule , choosing to take into account only the distance of a va medical facility from a veteran 's home and not whether the va facility can actually provide the services the veteran needs . veterans are being told they can not use their choice cards because they live within 40 miles of a va facility , even though that facility does not offer the care they require . the va is denying the access the law was intended to provide and forcing veterans to choose between traveling hours to a va medical facility , paying out of pocket or going without care altogether . veterans simply want what they were promised in the choice act : the choice to access the care they deserve in their community . in my hometown of hays , kansas , a veteran is forced to drive 200 miles several times a month for routine __cortisone__ shots because the va outpatient clinic just 25 miles from his home does not offer the shots he needs . one would think this veteran could use his choice card to visit a local physician or local hospital to get the shots he needs -- but the va is denying access to this care . thousands of veterans across the country are facing this same frustration . why is common sense not prevailing at the va ? why is the va not bending over backward to take care of veterans ? as a member of the senate veterans ' affairs committee , i have questioned va secretary bob mcdonald and other va officials for months in hearings , personal meetings , phone calls and correspondence about the va 's flawed interpretation of the __40-mile__ rule and what can be done to fix the problem . congress specifically included language in the choice act that gives the va the authority and flexibility it needs to provide veterans with access to care outside the va when the care needed by a veteran is `` either unavailable or not cost-effective to provide at a va facility . '' but for some reason , the va refuses to use the authority congress gave it and put the best interest of veterans first . enough is enough . in the absence of va action , i authored legislation that would make certain veterans are not dismissed or forgotten just because of where they live . the veterans access to community care act of 2015 -lrb- s. 207 -rrb- would require the va to utilize its authorities , including the choice act , to offer community care to veterans who are currently unable to receive the health care services they need from a va medical facility within 40 miles of where they live . this legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support in congress and has been endorsed by numerous veterans ' organizations , including the american legion , veterans of foreign wars , __amvets__ , vietnam veterans of america and the national guard association of the united states . when congress passed the choice act , we called on the va to live up to its commitment to care for those who have sacrificed for our country -- and we will not back down . we ought to always err on the side of what is best for the veteran , not what is best for the department of veterans affairs .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- it turns out that jupiter may be more than just an enormous ball of gas spinning a few hundred million miles farther out in the solar system . we __earthlings__ might have the giant planet to thank for our very existence . two scientists are suggesting that the inner solar system once played host to a bunch of `` __super-earths__ '' -- planets that were larger than our own but smaller than neptune . jupiter , however , put an end to those early occupiers of the inner orbits , __bulldozing__ in and sweeping them into the sun , according to a paper published this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . jupiter 's epic , __planet-shattering__ journey toward the sun and back out again laid the foundations for the creation of earth and the other smaller planets nearby -- mercury , venus and mars . `` our work suggests that jupiter 's __inward-outward__ migration could have destroyed a first generation of planets and set the stage for the formation of the __mass-depleted__ terrestrial planets that our solar system has today , '' said konstantin __batygin__ of caltech , one of the authors of the paper . the theory attempts to explain why our solar system is a bit of an oddball in our galactic neighborhood . most other systems that have planets orbiting around a star similar to our sun look very different . they generally have at least one planet significantly larger than earth that 's in a closer orbit than mercury 's . but they do n't have many objects farther out . maybe that 's because of jupiter 's destructive romp in the early history of the solar system . `` there is no reason to think that the dominant mode of planet formation throughout the galaxy should not have occurred here , '' __batygin__ said . `` it is more likely that subsequent changes have altered its original makeup . '' he and his co-author -- gregory __laughlin__ of university of california , santa cruz -- are building on a scenario of jupiter 's migration that was previously put forward by other scientists . known as the grand tack scenario , it describes jupiter getting drawn toward the sun in the early era of the solar system thanks to its huge mass . what stops it from being sucked right into the sun is saturn . the two gas giants start to exert gravitational influence on one another , entering a planetary dance that eventually sends them back farther out into the solar system . __batygin__ and __laughlin__ suggest that during its inward journey , jupiter dragged a load of planetary building blocks , known as __planetesimals__ , along with it . that sent the __planetesimals__ smashing into debris in the inner solar system , causing them to break apart and fall into the sun at a faster rate . the scientists say they ran a simulation of what would happen if there were also a number of __super-earths__ in the vicinity as well . they found that a wave of decaying __planetesimals__ would steer the __super-earths__ into the sun over the course of 20,000 years . `` it 's a very effective physical process , '' __batygin__ said . `` you only need a few earth masses worth of material to drive tens of earth masses worth of planets into the sun . '' on its way back out , jupiter left some remaining __planetesimals__ in its wake -- the building blocks that over millions of years would come to form earth , mercury , venus and mars .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints , which is the largest sponsor of boy scout troops in the united states , says the church has strong measures in place to prevent the sexual abuse of scouts , as claims have been made it has n't done enough . in the first interview about allegations of abuse in mormon __church-sponsored__ scouting troops , church elder l. whitney clayton told cnn that the church is at the forefront for prevention of child abuse . `` we feel like there is really no other organization that we know of -- a church or something like a church -- that does as much as we do , '' clayton said . `` we have a zero tolerance policy or position with respect to child abuse , and we train our people , we teach our people , we work with leaders , we provide materials online and in hard copy . '' over several months , cnn examined allegations of abuse that were detailed in at least five lawsuits filed against the church and the scouts . but clayton said the church today is proactive , even constructing its buildings `` in such a way as to try to avoid any situation where child abuse could occur . '' `` for instance , if you walk down the hallway in an __lds__ chapel , a mormon church , and look at the sunday school classes , you 're going to see windows in the doorways into those sunday school classes so people can look inside and walk by , '' he said . the interview with clayton followed a cnn investigation into the case of melvin novak , who was sexually abused by his __scoutmaster__ , a member of the mormon church , beginning when he was 14 years old in 1998 , according to the lawsuit novak filed against the church and the boy scouts of america . the __scoutmaster__ , vance hein , had been forced in resign from scouting in the early 1990s after reports surfaced that he failed to report a fellow __scoutmaster__ who was engaged in homosexual activities . that __scoutmaster__ ended up going to prison for sexual assaults on minors . hein 's name was added to the boy scouts of america 's ineligible volunteer files , which are widely known as the `` perversion files . '' the documents , which were made public in 2012 , are lists of scout leaders suspected of sexual abuse or homosexual activity . however , three years after being kicked out of scouting , hein was allowed to rejoin the scouts after getting letters of recommendation __attesting__ to his character . one of those letters was from hein 's influential mormon bishop jack moyer , who wrote that hein was `` highly respected and liked . '' moyer , who is now retired , declined to speak to cnn . but in a deposition taken as part of the lawsuit last year , he acknowledged that he would not have written the letter knowing what he later found out about hein . the lawsuit charged that hein `` actively groomed young boys under his charge for later sexual molestation . '' hein eventually was convicted of molesting novak . he is now in prison for violating probation in the novak case . ken __rothweiler__ , who is novak 's lawyer , said what happened in the case is outrageous . `` this case is probably the most egregious of all of the cases against the __lds__ church , and the reason i say that is because the __lds__ church knew that vance hein , this pedophile , was already kicked out of scouting by the boy scouts of america , '' __rothweiler__ said . however , church attorney david __pittinsky__ said it was the boy scouts organization that should have done something . `` if the boy scouts had disclosed to bishop moyer the information they had in their files , there is no way that vance hein would have ever become a __scoutmaster__ , and he would have been subject to __excommunication__ by the church , '' __pittinsky__ said . in a statement to cnn , the boy scouts of america said hein was removed from scouting `` for reasons unrelated to child abuse . '' the group added , `` our efforts to protect youth were plainly insufficient , inappropriate or wrong . we extend our deepest apologies to victims and their families . '' read the full response from the boy scouts . the case ended last year with a confidential settlement paid to novak , who is now 31 . all but one of the five lawsuits filed against the church and boy scouts of america have been settled . hein was sentenced to probation in 2000 after pleading guilty to indecently assaulting novak . while on probation , he was arrested for possession of child pornography and was sentenced in 2012 to 15 to 30 years in prison . `` any case is alarming to me . it 's a tragedy , '' clayton said . `` i 'm a father . i have seven children , four boys and three girls . i have 19 grandchildren . the thought of one of them as a child or youth being abused is absolutely horrific to me . '' asked what he would say to novak , clayton said , `` i say to him and anyone else who has been abused in the church or other churches -- i 'm sorry that you 've gone through what you 've gone through . it 's a horrible thing for anyone to be abused . no child , no youth should ever have to go through that .

'' lopez described him as a `` charismatic , good person , with a good soul and a good spirit '' who experienced a lapse in judgment . `` his behavior is a result of his influence of the fraternity system and the traditions that have been embedded since __pre-civil__ war times , when the fraternity was made , which obviously were n't the most tolerant times , '' lopez said . the second student expelled , pettit does not have much of a digital footprint . what appears to be his now deleted twitter page mainly focuses on his musings about college football . pettit played golf at his alma mater , highland park high school , the dallas morning news reported . in a statement , his parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to african-americans , students and university faculty . `` he is a good boy , but what we saw in those videos is disgusting , '' brody and susan pettit said . `` while it may be difficult for those who only know levi from the video to understand , we know his heart , and he is not a racist . '' cnn has reached out to both students but has not heard back from rice . a spokesman for the pettit family declined cnn 's request for an interview .

'' `` this was not some jolly __jape__ that went awry . for once , we did nothing wrong , '' he told the sun . top gear producers said the numbers and letters on the registration plates had not been chosen deliberately . the motoring show , fronted by clarkson , james may and richard hammond , has made a name for itself globally with risky stunts and a brand of __blokish__ humor that often __treads__ the line and regularly steps over it . clarkson is determinedly __anti-politically__ correct among the topics he rails about , both on the show and in his newspaper and magazine columns . favored topics include __environmentalism__ , traffic laws and liberals . the latest `` fracas '' has seen clarkson suspended by the bbc , which broadcasts top gear , for allegedly hitting a producer . the presenter , who is one of the bbc 's highest earners , has previously caused offense during shoots in foreign countries and regularly court controversy at home . in july 2014 , clarkson came under fire for a racist comment made during a top gear special in myanmar . the slur came during a show segment which showed hosts clarkson , hammond and may looking at a bridge they had built over the river __kwai__ as a local man walked over it . `` that is a proud moment . but there 's a slope on it , '' clarkson said . `` you 're right , '' co-star hammond replied . `` it 's definitely higher on that side .

ARTICEL:     moscow -lrb- cnn -rrb- russian president vladimir putin appeared in public monday for the first time in about 10 days as he met with kyrgyz president __almazbek__ __atambayev__ in the russian city of st. petersburg . putin is n't generally one to shy away from the limelight -- posing with a -lrb- __tranquilized__ -rrb- tiger , riding a horse while shirtless , earning a karate black belt . so his unexplained absence fueled speculation about his health , grip on power and even his love life . although the kremlin and the russian state media released photos and video footage of putin last week , they did not quell the rumors about his whereabouts , because it was unclear when they were taken . so all eyes were turned to st. petersburg on monday for putin 's scheduled meeting with __atambayev__ of kyrgyzstan . his appearance before the press , looking healthy and relaxed , should help put some of the rumors at least to rest . and he made light of his absence , saying : `` it would be boring without gossip . '' in another sign putin has a firm hand on the tiller , defense minister sergey shoigu said the president had ordered russia 's northern fleet to be placed on full combat alert from monday morning for snap checks , russia 's state-run __tass__ news agency reported . the checks are intended to test the fleet 's capacity to ensure russia 's military security in the arctic , __tass__ said . also on alert are russia 's western military district and certain airborne units , with some 38,000 military personnel involved in total . here 's what gave some doubters __grist__ for the rumor mill : on friday -- three days before the scheduled meeting -- a russian state media broadcaster prematurely aired a report that putin had a meeting with __atambayev__ -- although the event had not yet occurred . the station acknowledged the error , but it only heightened the speculation over putin and his whereabouts . social media has been swirling with questions , with hashtags such as __#putindead__ and __#putinmissing__ . was he ill ? was he holed away somewhere with his girlfriend and a new baby , as some in the european media speculated ? there were even dark rumors of a palace coup in which various kremlin factions vying for power might have ousted him . the kremlin vigorously denied that anything was amiss , with putin 's spokesman saying the president was healthy and that his handshake `` can break a hand . '' but his absence came at an uneasy time as the country deals with economic turmoil and strained international relations over the war in ukraine . `` does putin ever catch a cold ? does he ever get sick ? the kremlin does n't want to allow putin 's image of __virility__ and strength to become tarnished by the weaknesses of mere humans , '' cnn analyst frida ghitis wrote . `` putin rules in the old-fashioned style of a personality cult . the system requires propaganda and image control . it needs putin to be larger than life . '' last week , presidential spokesman dmitry peskov sought to allay questions , telling russian radio station echo of moscow that people should not worry and that putin was `` absolutely '' healthy . `` no need to worry , everything is all right . he has working meetings all the time , only not all of these meetings are public , '' peskov said thursday . he also dismissed european media reports that putin had a love child . `` i am going to ask people who have money to organize a contest on the best media rumor , '' the kremlin spokesman said . rumblings about putin began last week after a meeting in the kazakh capital , astana , between the russian leader and the presidents of kazakhstan and belarus was postponed at short notice . a kazakh official told reuters that putin had fallen ill . on thursday , he missed his meeting with the federal security service , russia 's counterintelligence agency . putin 's last public appearance was supposedly on march 8 , international women 's day . but some keeping track say he had n't been seen since even earlier -- march 5 . in the course of his many years in power , putin has cultivated the image of a strong and vigorous leader . his exploits , captured on film and released to the media , have been many . and he enjoys a whopping 86 % approval rating , although some critics question the validity of polling they say is carried out in a climate where people are afraid to voice opposition to putin 's government . `` moscow always has been a center for rumors and speculation , '' said jill dougherty , an expert on russia at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars and a former cnn correspondent . `` as soon as the president does not show up , which is really kind of rare for him , people begin to question . `` you have to look at this in terms of , why all of this insanity ? and one of the problems is , people are very nervous , legitimately . where is putin ? is he in charge ?

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- when walter isaacson 's biography of steve jobs came out in october 2011 -- less than three weeks after jobs ' death -- it __crystallized__ many popularly held perceptions of the apple co-founder . yes , jobs was brilliant . and yes , jobs also could be a bastard . isaacson 's book contained numerous examples of jobs ' cruel behavior , such as verbally abusing employees whose work did n't meet his exacting standards . now a new book is presenting a kinder , gentler portrait of the mercurial tech exec . `` becoming steve jobs , '' by brent __schlender__ and rick __tetzeli__ , seeks to __humanize__ jobs through interviews with those who knew him in the latter , wildly successful phases of his career , when some of his rough edges had softened . the book , which went on sale tuesday , has created a strange irony . unlike isaacson 's book , it 's an unauthorized bio , one that was not given jobs ' blessing before he died . and yet apple , mindful of jobs ' legacy , has clearly endorsed this new vision of their former ceo over the isaacson version . `` i thought the isaacson book did him a tremendous disservice . it was just a __rehash__ of a bunch of stuff that had already been written , and focused on small parts of his personality , '' says current apple ceo tim cook in the new book . `` you get the feeling that -lrb- steve 's -rrb- a greedy , selfish __egomaniac__ . it did n't capture the person . the person i read about there is somebody i would never have wanted to work with over all this time . life is too short . '' other apple execs also have heaped praise on `` becoming steve jobs '' while criticizing isaacson 's bestseller . `` best portrayal is about to be released - becoming steve jobs -lrb- book -rrb- . well done and first to get it right , '' tweeted eddy cue , apple 's chief of software , last week . and __jony__ ive , apple 's head of design , said in a new yorker profile last month , `` my regard -lrb- for isaacson 's book -rrb- could n't be any lower . '' isaacson , for his part , told the new york times recently that he tried to present a balanced view of jobs : `` my book is very favorable and honest , with no anonymous slings , '' he said . although jobs ' life and career have been well chronicled , the new book contains some fresh __tidbits__ : . -- in 2009 , when jobs was dying of cancer , cook offered his boss a piece of his liver but jobs refused , saying , `` no , i 'll never let you do that . '' -- what was likely the last movie jobs watched before his death was an odd choice : `` remember the titans , '' the sentimental disney drama about a racially integrated high school football team in 1971 . `` i was so surprised he wanted to watch that movie , '' cook recalled . `` i was like , ` are you sure ? ' steve was not interested in sports at all . '' -- and jobs ' famous commencement speech at stanford university in 2005 almost got derailed before it started . a police officer turned him and his family away from the campus , saying the parking lot was full , and expressed skepticism that the scruffy jobs , wearing his usual jeans and black t-shirt , was really the event 's keynote speaker . raves from apple aside , early reviews of `` becoming steve jobs '' have been mixed . '' ` becoming steve jobs ' offers a more rounded portrait of the man not only because it does n't lean as heavily on its interviews or stretch for historical weight like isaacson 's book , but because it brings in __schlender__ 's personal interactions with the apple co-founder , '' wrote mic wright for the next web . `` but the closeness of __schlender__ 's connection with jobs is also problematic , '' added wright , saying '' ... there 's a sense of seeking to explain away bad behavior . '' `` while the book never attempts to portray jobs as a saint , it provides ample evidence to suggest that the brash , perpetually impatient young millionaire learned how to control his worst tendencies , eventually becoming a loving father and respected mentor , '' wrote jeremy __horwitz__ in 9 to 5 mac . `` like other good books that have been written about jobs , it does n't provide the definitive story of his life , but instead adds some new and interesting details that are worth considering alongside what was previously known .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- with majorities in both chambers of congress , it is time for republicans to begin rolling back six years of failed obama administration policies . our highest priority during the ongoing budget debate should be undoing the damage caused by defense sequestration and the hundreds of billions of dollars of defense cuts made by the obama administration . regrettably , military strength is seen in many quarters as the cause of military __adventurism__ . a strong , robust defense is seen not to deter aggression , but to provoke it . for years , we have systematically underfunded our military , marrying a philosophy of retreat with a misplaced understanding of our larger budgetary burdens and the real drivers of the debt : our entitlement programs . as expected , almost four years after the passage of the budget control act , virtually nothing has been done to address the unsustainable growth of our entitlement programs , while essential defense programs have been sacrificed . political leaders in washington need to be reminded that our defense is the single most important responsibility of the federal government . instead of starting the process by setting arbitrary defense spending levels and then forcing our military to cut vital programs in order to meet these levels , the budgeting process should start by taking into account all the threats against us , listing the programs and capabilities we 'll need to protect our people and interests around the world , and then funding those efforts . even though we 've been able to keep the homeland safe for more than a decade , the threats to americans at home and abroad are growing . from the rise of the islamic state and the spread of islamic terrorism , to russia 's aggression in europe , to chinese __expansionism__ in the south china sea , the threats to american security are growing . yet , even as the world outside our borders is filled with more doubt and uncertainty , the united states has been steadily reducing our spending on defense . even before sequestration , president obama made defense cuts of $ __487__ billion over 10 years and redirected the savings to already bloated domestic programs . this was followed by tens of billions more in defense cuts each year because of sequestration , which , when combined with obama 's prior cuts , will total $ 1 trillion over the coming decade . all of these reductions were enacted despite the warnings of four secretaries of defense and our entire military leadership . the results of these cuts have been disastrous for our military and for our ability to project power and deter our enemies . the slight increase in president obama 's proposed 2016 budget wo n't significantly change that . at the end of this process , our military will be significantly smaller , dramatically less capable and dangerously __unready__ to deploy if these budget cuts remain in place . the army is on the path to be reduced to pre-world war ii levels . the navy is at __pre-wwi__ levels . and our air force has the smallest and oldest combat force in its history . our force reductions have been felt throughout the world -- by our friends and our enemies . they have presented not just a crisis of readiness for america , but also a perilous strategic weakness . our adversaries have been emboldened by what they perceive as our diminished military presence . history has shown that every time we have unreasonably cut resources from our military in anticipation of a peace dividend , it has only cost us more to make up for the deficit we create in military readiness and capability , and the expected era of perpetual peace fails to materialize . we think we are saving money , but in the long run , we end up paying more and creating more risk and uncertainty . we can afford the military we need , but we must make it a priority . for this reason , we introduced an amendment to the senate budget resolution this week to address the dangerous funding gap our military currently faces . we believe we must increase the resources available to our military to the levels proposed by -lrb- former -rrb- defense secretary robert gates in his __fy12__ budget , the last defense budget based solely on an assessment of the threats we face and the requisite military needs to deal with those threats . it is the budget that the bipartisan , __congressionally-mandated__ national defense panel stated was `` the minimum required to reverse course and set the military on a more stable footing . '' now that republicans control both house of congress , it is time to support a defense budget that actually reflects the world in which we live , not the world the way we wish it was . until now , our approach as a country and a party since the budget control act has not been one of american strength . continuing on the current path will only invite war and conflict through weakness . we need to heed the bipartisan warnings of our nation 's military leaders and get back on track toward a defense budget that reflects the realities of the challenges we face and is worthy of our brave men and women in uniform . in the end , it is they who will suffer the most if sequestration is not reversed and our readiness and equipment continues to degrade . as members of congress , we have a sacred obligation to ensure that they have the best possible training and equipment so they can successfully complete their missions . despite the fiscal constraints imposed on our military , they are doing their part and are holding up their end of the bargain . it 's time that we hold up ours .

'' they continued to communicate over the following weeks , with hasan edmonds expressing concerns about jonas edmonds ' criminal record and whether he would be allowed to travel overseas . `` they try hard to keep people like him trapped in america , '' he told the undercover fbi employee . `` i know several muslims have been caught attempting the turkey route so tell me why not many americans take the egypt route . i am open to either way , '' hasan edmonds told the informant , according to court documents . on february 2 , hasan edmonds contacted the undercover informant again and said his cousin was willing to carry out an attack on u.s. soil . `` honestly we would love to do something like the brother in paris did , '' hasan edmonds stated , referring to the french terror attacks in january in which 16 people were killed . prosecutors said jonas edmonds contacted the informant to arrange travel accommodations . `` number one on my list is mosul , '' he stated , referring to iraq 's second-largest city . `` if i find myself stuck here -lsb- in the united states -rsb- , i intend to take advantage of being so close to the __kuffar__ . '' jonas edmonds this week accepted that he would be unable to travel and told the fbi informant of his intention to buy ak-47s and grenades to carry out an attack on the military facility . he would use his cousin 's uniform and `` anticipated a body count of 100 to 150 . '' he was given a list of officer rankings by his cousin and advised to `` kill the head , '' according to court documents . prosecutors said jonas edmonds planned to carry out the attack after hasan edmonds left the country . hasan edmonds ' sister said that the family does not believe the allegations against the cousins . `` it 's all a shock , we do n't suspect any of these accusations , '' __manchinique__ bates told cnn affiliate wls . `` we do not believe that any of these alleged charges are true . i honestly do not feel as if my brother is in the u.s. military , but yet leaving the country to join isis . that 's ludicrous . they are n't terrorists . '' a federal complaint alleges that hasan edmonds came to the attention of the fbi in late 2014 . the complaints uses the acronym isil , or islamic state of iraq and the levant . hasan edmonds planned to use his military training to fight for the terrorist organization , prosecutors said in a statement . hasan edmonds booked airline travel to depart wednesday from chicago and arrive in cairo on thursday . the cousins presented an undercover informant with plans to attacks the military facility , prosecutors said . who has been recruited to isis from the west ? `` disturbingly , one of the defendants currently wears the same uniform of those they allegedly planned to attack , '' carlin said in the statement . conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine . the number of foreign fighters traveling to join isis 's ranks is increasing at an alarming rate , a top u.s. counterterrorism official said last month . more than 20,000 fighters , from more than 90 countries , have traveled to the isis battlefield , according to the testimony of nicholas rasmussen , director of the national counterterrorism center , before the house homeland security committee . the rate of foreign fighters traveling to syria `` exceeds the rate of travelers who went to afghanistan and pakistan , iraq , yemen or somalia at any point in the last 20 years , '' rasmussen said . of those fighters , an estimated 3,400 are believed to have come from western countries , including more than 150 from the united states , officials said . a u.s. air force veteran , who allegedly tried to join isis but was turned back by turkish authorities before he could get to syria , pleaded not guilty earlier this month to terror-related charges in a federal court in new york . __tairod__ nathan webster pugh , accused of making the foiled attempt in january , was indicted by a grand jury on charges of trying to give material support to the terror group and obstruction of justice , the u.s. justice department said in a __two-count__ indictment . cnn 's evan perez contributed to this report .

'' departure : barcelona , spain , at 10:01 a.m. -lrb- 26 minutes late -rrb- . destination : scheduled to land in dusseldorf , germany , at 11:39 a.m. passengers : 150 -lrb- 144 passengers , six crew members -rrb- . airplane : airbus a320 -lrb- __twin-jet__ -rrb- . airline : __germanwings__ -lrb- budget airline owned by lufthansa -rrb- . flight distance : __726__ miles . last known tracking data : 10:38 a.m. . last known speed : 480 mph . last known altitude : __11,400__ feet . last known location : near __digne-les-bains__ , france , in the alps . sources : cnn and flightaware.com . flight __9525__ took off just after 10 a.m. tuesday from barcelona , spain , for dusseldorf , germany , with 144 passengers -- among them two babies -- and six crew members . it went down at 10:53 a.m. -lrb- __5:53__ a.m. et -rrb- in a remote area near __digne-les-bains__ in the __alpes__ de haute provence region . all aboard are presumed dead . helicopter crews found the airliner in pieces , none of them bigger than a small car , and human remains strewn for several hundred meters , according to gilbert __sauvan__ , a high-level official in the __alpes__ de haute provence region who is being briefed on the operation . authorities were not able to retrieve any bodies tuesday , with the frozen ground complicating the effort . wednesday may not be much easier , with snow in the forecast . spanish and german officials moved to join hundreds of french firefighters and police in the area , working together to help in the recovery effort and try to figure out exactly what happened . as of tuesday evening , there were few clues . one of the aircraft 's data recorders , the so-called black boxes , has been found , according to french interior minister bernard cazeneuve , but it was too early to tell what it would say about the crash . `` we do n't know much about the flight and the crash yet , '' german chancellor angela merkel said . `` and we do n't know the cause . '' relatives of those believed to be on the flight , fearing the worst , gathered at the barcelona airport , where a crisis center was set up . french authorities set up a chapel near the crash site . lufthansa group said the company will look after the relatives of those on board . `` there will be a contact center established in france ; relatives who would like to take advantage of this will be transferred to the contact center at no cost -- and their accommodation paid for -- just as soon as the center has been established , '' lufthansa said . those aboard included a `` high number of spaniards , germans and turks , '' according to spain 's king felipe vi . __germanwings__ ceo thomas __winkelmann__ said it 's believed 67 people , or nearly half those on the plane , are german citizens . __germanwings__ crash : who was on the plane ? sixteen students and two teachers from one german high school , called joseph koenig gymnasium , were among those booked on flight __9525__ , according to florian __adamik__ , a municipal official in __haltern__ , the town where the school is located . a crisis center has been established at the city hall in __haltern__ , which is about 77 kilometers -lrb- 48 miles -rrb- north of dusseldorf 's airport . __winkelmann__ confirmed the 16 students and two teachers were on the plane . __haltern__ 's mayor , __bodo__ __klimpel__ , said they had been heading home after taking part in a foreign exchange program . `` the whole city is shocked , and we can feel it everywhere , '' __klimpel__ said . a dutch citizen and a belgian -- the latter a resident of barcelona -- were among those on the flight , according to those countries ' foreign ministries . two australians and two colombians were also believed to be on board . __germanwings__ started in 2002 and was taken over by lufthansa seven years later as its low-cost airline , handling an increasing number of __midrange__ flights around europe . it was forced to cancel some flights tuesday because there were crews that did n't want to fly upon hearing news of the crash . the valley where the plane went down is long and snow-covered , and access is difficult , said the mayor of the nearby town of __barcelonnette__ , pierre __martin-charpenel__ . it was well populated in the 19th century but there are almost no people living there now , he said . it 's an __out-of-the-way__ place with magnificent scenery , he said . the sports hall of a local school has been freed up to take in bodies of the victims of the plane crash , said __sandrine__ julien from the town hall of __seyne-les-alpes__ village . __seyne-les-alpes__ is about 10 kilometers from the crash site . mountain guide __yvan__ __theaudin__ told bfmtv the crash was in the area of the __massif__ des __trois__ __eveches__ , where there are peaks of nearly 3,000 meters -lrb- 1.9 miles -rrb- . it 's very snowy in the area and the weather is worsening , he said , which could complicate search and rescue efforts . responders may have to use skis to reach the crash site on the ground , he said . __sandrine__ __boisse__ , president of the tourism office at the __pra__ __loup__ ski resort , said she heard the plane crash and called the police and the local government office to find out what had happened . `` it was about 11 -lrb- a.m. -rrb- here . i was outside the garage , and we heard a strange noise , and at first we thought it was an avalanche , '' she said . `` something was wrong . ... we did n't know what . '' a mountain guide who heard a plane fly at alarmingly low altitude shortly before the crash , michel __suhubiette__ , said helicopters may be the only way to get to the crash site . according to the u.s. federal aviation administration , just under 16 % of aviation accidents occur during the cruise portion of a flight -- meaning after the climb and before descent . accidents are more common during takeoff and landing . the twin-engine airbus __a320s__ , which entered service in 1988 , is generally considered among the most reliable aircraft , aviation analyst david __soucie__ said . the captain of the crashed plane had flown for __germanwings__ for more than 10 years , and had more than 6,000 flight hours on this model of airbus . the plane itself dates to 1991 and was last checked in dusseldorf on monday , according to __winkelmann__ . so what happened ? cnn aviation analyst mary schiavo said the plane 's speed is one clue . according to __germanwings__ , the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet , and then dropped for eight minutes . the plane lost contact with french radar at a height of approximately 6,000 feet . then it crashed . this could indicate that there was not a stall , but that the pilot was still controlling the plane to some extent , schiavo said . had there been an engine stall , the plane would have crashed in a matter of minutes , she said . that small piece of information about the descent means that the pilot could have been trying to make an emergency landing , or that the plane was gliding with the pilot 's guidance , schiavo said . a scenario where the plane was gliding is potentially more dangerous because wide fields for landing would be hard to come by in the mountains , she said . the crash spurred officials in several countries to offer their condolences and pledge solidarity and cooperation to help those affected and determine what happened . `` our thoughts and our prayers are with our friends in europe , especially the people of germany and spain , following the terrible airplane crash in france , '' u.s. president barack obama told reporters . `` it 's particularly heartbreaking because it apparently includes the loss of so many children , some of them infants . '' germany 's merkel said she was sending two ministers to france on tuesday and would travel to the crash site on wednesday to see it for herself . `` we have to think of the victims and their families and their friends , '' she said . german foreign minister __frank-walter__ __steinmeier__ said the german government had set up a crisis center in response to the `` terrible news '' and was in close contact with the french authorities . `` in these difficult hours , our thoughts are with those who have to fear that their close ones are among the passengers and crew , '' he said . cnn 's mariano castillo , hala __gorani__ , laura __akhoun__ , stephanie __halasz__ , lindsay isaac , josh levs , richard greene , karl penhaul and sara __delgrossi__ contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     london -lrb- cnn -rrb- __cabinet-maker__ michael __ibsen__ has just put the finishing touches to a coffin ; built of __highly-polished__ , __honey-colored__ english oak and yew , it has been a labor of love , pondered over and painstakingly crafted . because this is n't any ordinary commission : the casket will be the final resting place of one of __ibsen__ 's distant relatives , richard iii , who died more than 500 years ago . `` it is a unique privilege , '' says canadian-born __ibsen__ , whose dna was used to establish the identity of the english king , found buried beneath a car parking lot in the city of leicester in august 2012 . `` there 's a wonderful serendipity in a sense that someone involved in the identification of the remains should happen to be furniture maker who can do this . `` when you 're working away you just focus on joining two bits of wood , but at the end of the day when you stand back and think ` i 'm building richard iii 's coffin , ' it 's incredible . '' __ibsen__ says he 's been on an `` extraordinary journey '' in the two-and-a-half years since he gave a dna swab to genetics specialist __turi__ king on the off chance that experts searching for the burial place of his __seventeen-times__ great-uncle might strike it lucky . back then even the man in charge of the dig , archaeologist richard buckley , did n't expect to find anything -- he told colleagues he 'd `` eat his hat '' if they turned up the long-lost king 's remains . `` when we were planning the project , i never made any secret of the fact i thought it very unlikely we 'd be successful , '' buckley told cnn . `` the chances of hitting the right spot were very slim . '' call it a fluke , or call it fate , but as it turned out they hit the right spot almost immediately : richard iii 's skeleton was found on the very first day of the dig , in the first trench dug by the team . at the time , all the experts knew was that they 'd found a set of leg bones , chopped off at the feet by building work at some point in the intervening centuries . it was n't until days later , as archaeologist jo appleby carefully exhumed the rest of the skeleton that she spotted the distinct curve of its spine , and the devastating damage medieval weapons had left on its skull . for philippa langley , founder of the `` looking for richard '' project , who stood watching with __bated__ breath as the bones were uncovered , the discovery was a vindication of the years she had spent trying to get people to search for the king 's remains -- and to look again at his reputation . say the name richard iii to many people , and the image which will spring to mind is that of shakespeare 's villain , __hunchbacked__ and murderous , who met a grisly end on the battlefield at bosworth after killing his nephews , the princes in the tower . years of research had convinced langley of two things : firstly , that his remains lay underneath a car park , in what had once been the grey friars ' monastery , and secondly , that he was much-maligned , the victim of bitter tudor propaganda after his death . two-and-a-half years on , langley believes the discovery -- which proved her first theory to be correct -- and the scientific research carried out since , have forced a rethink of richard iii 's story . `` as a writer my view of richard has always been that he was a very complex , very conflicted , very flawed individual -- that 's the human condition : we are all flawed , complex , conflicted -- but there was something heroic about him , he was courageous on and off the battlefield , '' she explains . she says dna evidence that the king was blue eyed and fair haired -- in contrast to portraits and written descriptions which painted him `` as a __hunchback__ , with a withered arm and a crippled gait , with ` evil ' dark eyes and hair '' -- had `` blow -lsb- n -rsb- the mythology out of the window . '' `` it makes people question , drop their preconceptions , forget their assumptions , and go back to the beginning , '' she says . this weekend , richard iii 's skeleton will leave the laboratory at the university of leicester , where it has been kept since it was found , and be taken back to bosworth , scene of his death in 1485 , for a commemoration ceremony , before being returned to leicester ahead of its __reburial__ next week . and while his body last made that trip slung unceremoniously over the back of a horse , this time the journey will be done in style : carried in the coffin made by his __great-nephew__ . inside , the smaller bones from his hands and feet will be tucked into linen bags -- each one decorated with a rose , representing the house of york , richard iii 's family -- sewn by children from leicester 's king richard iii infant school . `` i feel very proud because i 've never made a bag for a king before , '' said xi chen , who helped make the pouches . `` it 's like i 'm a servant doing something for a king , '' added his classmate irfan sheikh . lead conservation specialist jon __castleman__ -- who previously helped to restore the dome of the rock in jerusalem -- will be the last person to set eyes on the skeleton , as he __welds__ the __ossuary__ inside the casket shut . well-wishers are expected to line the route as the cortege winds through the leicestershire countryside , stopping at several churches along the way for prayers and religious services before making its way back to leicester cathedral , near the site of the archaeological dig , where a new tomb has been built for the king . historian john __ashdown-hill__ , who discovered the __genealogical__ link between richard iii and michael __ibsen__ , says it is important that the king 's catholic beliefs are recognized in the ceremonies . __ashdown-hill__ , who shares richard iii 's faith , has had a rosary , featuring the white __yorkist__ rose and a crucifix like one thought to have been owned by richard iii 's mother , made to be placed inside the coffin . for langley , the procession and celebrations are key to repairing past damage . `` the ethos and aim of the project was to give richard what he did n't get in 1485 , '' she says . `` the reason we wanted to do that was to recognize what went on in the past but not repeat it , to make peace with history .

ARTICEL:     sanaa , yemen -lrb- cnn -rrb- in just a few weeks , good relations with neighbors have become a matter of survival for yemen 's president abdu __rabu__ mansour hadi . on saturday , he joined his allies in egypt , while battles raged on in his country . after houthi rebels occupied the capital sanaa weeks ago , his government fled . when hadi called for military intervention to beat back their attempt to overthrow him , adjacent countries answered with a grand airstrike operation . in the darkness of early saturday , their jets increased the hail of ordnance on sanaa , as saudi led operation __al-hazm__ storm went into its third day . and hadi waited in sharm el-sheikh , egypt to meet with the region 's leaders at the arab league summit . this past `` night was by far the scariest night since the raids started , '' said journalist hakim __almasmari__ in sanaa . `` the strikes were so strong and continuous . '' the jets bombarded hadi 's weapons caches and other military assets , houthi and yemeni government officials said . saudi arabia has blockaded the houthis , effectively cutting off their supply lines , and its air force controls yemeni airspace . saudi arabia and egypt have spoken about the possibility of putting boots on the ground . the arab league is expected to give its official blessing to __al-hazm__ storm on saturday , which could clear the way for a ground invasion , cnn 's becky anderson reported . but a few member nations , such as shiite majority iraq or possibly algeria , could give military action a thumbs down . though the saudi kingdom has taken the lead with some 100 warplanes , the coalition partners include the united arab emirates , kuwait , bahrain , qatar , jordan , morocco , sudan and egypt . arab spring was n't supposed to turn out like this . together they comprise about a third of the arab league 's membership . they are majority sunni muslim nations , and the houthi rebels are shiite muslims allied with iran . having yemen become an iranian satellite country on its border would be perceived as a major threat by neighboring saudi arabia , which sees the houthis as proxies of tehran , saudi arabia 's bitter rival on the persian gulf . iran has sharply denounced the armed intervention . the united states , on the other hand , strongly approves of it and is supporting it __logistically__ , and aiding coalition forces in locating targets , but it is not participating in active battle . a small contingency of u.s. forces had been stationed in yemen to help in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , but left once houthi rebels took the capital . dozens of people have died in the strikes , and on saturday , human rights watch said many of the victims were civilians , perhaps as many as 34 . `` reports of air strikes and anti-aircraft weapons in heavily populated areas raise serious concerns that not enough is being done to ensure their safety , '' hrw regional spokesman joe stork said . a saudi arabia defense official blamed civilian deaths on the houthis , saying they were using them as human shields . brig. gen. ahmed bin hasan __asiri__ said the kingdom 's military was using precision weapons to avoid collateral damage , state-run saudi news agency reported . media outlets have come under fire as well . an hour after hadi ordered the closure of all __houthi-controlled__ media -- including yemen tv and saba tv -- houthis raided two tv channels and the prominent al __masdar__ newspaper . al jazeera 's office in sanaa was also targeted , the __qatar-based__ network said , with houthis looting security cameras and damaging equipment . opinion : why yemen has come undone . journalist hakim __almasmari__ reported from yemen , and cnn 's ben brumfield wrote this story from atlanta . cnn 's becky anderson , salma abdelaziz and mustafa al-arab contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- nigeria 's military says its forces have retaken the northeastern town of __gwoza__ , which boko haram militants last year declared the headquarters of their `` caliphate . '' the announcement comes on the eve of the west african country 's general elections . `` just this morning , the gallant troops of the nigerian military in a concerted and __well-coordinated__ land and air operations have liberated __gwoza__ , the headquarters of their so-called caliphate , '' major general chris __olukolade__ said in a defense ministry statement friday . __olukolade__ said the troops had routed boko haram fighters in towns and villages leading to __gwoza__ . `` several of the terrorists have died and many of them captured in the process . a lot of arms and ammunition have been recovered and the administrative headquarters completely destroyed . a massive cordon and search has commenced to locate any of the fleeing terrorists or hostages in their custody , '' __olukolade__ said . boko haram declared its own `` caliphate '' after seizing the area around __gwoza__ , in borno state , in august 2014 , according to the chatham house think tank . the militant group has purportedly pledged allegiance to isis and says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of sharia law across nigeria , which is split between the majority muslim north and the mostly christian south . nigeria 's general elections take place saturday . the polls had been scheduled for february 14 , but on february 7 , nigeria 's election commission announced they would be postponed for six weeks due to security concerns , with the military needing more time to secure areas controlled by boko haram . the controversial decision was unpopular among many nigerians and led to widespread protests . nigerian president goodluck jonathan , who is running for reelection , has been criticized for not doing enough to combat boko haram . on friday , jonathan referenced the __gwoza__ victory in a broadcast to the nation , praising nigeria 's armed forces for their `` immense sacrifices '' in defending the nation . `` we are also glad that our gallant armed forces have successfully stemmed the seizure of nigerian territories in the northeast by the terrorist group , boko haram , '' jonathan said . `` they have recaptured most of the communities and territories formerly occupied by the insurgents , making it possible for thousands of internally displaced nigerians to begin returning to their homes and communities . '' jonathan said security agencies were fully prepared to deal decisively with `` any group or persons who attempt to disrupt the peaceful conduct of the elections . '' `` those who may harbor any intentions of testing our will by unleashing violence during the elections in order to advance their political ambitions should think again as all necessary measures have been put in place to ensure that any persons who breach the peace or cause public disorder during or after the elections are speedily apprehended and summarily dealt with according to our laws , '' the president said . on thursday , jonathan and maj. gen. muhammad __buhari__ , the other leading presidential candidate , issued a pledge __reaffirming__ their commitment to `` free , fair and credible elections '' following their signing of a nonviolence pledge -- the abuja accord -- in january . the international criminal court also issued a warning that anyone inciting or engaging in electoral violence `` at a time when abhorrent levels of violence already plague parts of the country '' is subject to prosecution , `` either by nigerian courts or by the icc . '' `` no one should doubt my office 's resolve to prosecute individuals responsible for the commission of icc crimes , whenever necessary , '' icc chief prosecutor __fatou__ __bensouda__ said in the statement . boko haram attacks have killed at least 1,000 civilians so far this year , according to a human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- statement released thursday . citing interviews with witnesses , it said the militants rounded up 300 __gwoza__ residents when it overran the town , then took them to a camp in the __sambisa__ forest . `` after five months during which other residents remained trapped on the hills , hiding in caves and weakened by hunger , boko haram attacked the civilians there , killing many and forcing others to escape over the border into cameroon , '' the rights group said . `` each week that passes we learn of more brutal boko haram abuses against civilians , '' said hrw researcher __mausi__ __segun__ , adding that nigeria `` needs to make protecting civilians a priority in military operations against boko haram . '' the rights group said nigerian security forces had `` failed to take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population '' when fighting boko haram but noted that , according to the government , military police were investigating those claims . amnesty international said in september that reports of alleged abuses by nigerian security forces had increased since the government stepped up its fight against boko haram . the rights group alleged systemic use of torture by the police , based on hundreds of witness testimonies and other evidence gathered over a 10-year span . a spokesman for the nigeria police force disputed the claims , saying torture and abuse were not `` repeat , not an official policy of the nigeria police '' and that the amnesty report contained `` some blatant falsehoods . '' earlier this month , isis purportedly said it welcomed boko haram after the latter pledged allegiance to it . in an audio message purportedly from an isis spokesman , the group announced that it had accepted a pledge of allegiance from boko haram . isis supporters posted the audio online . cnn can not independently authenticate the __28-minute__ message . the message said that isis , which calls itself the islamic state , had expanded to west africa and congratulated `` our jihadi brothers '' there . it followed the posting online of an __unauthenticated__ audio message purportedly from boko haram 's leader , abubakar shekau , on march 9 in which the speaker announced that the terror group wanted to join isis . since 2009 , boko haram , whose name translates as `` western education is sin , '' has waged a campaign of terror aimed at instituting a stricter version of sharia law in nigeria . boko haram 's tactics have intensified in recent years , from battling nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages , mass kidnappings , assassinations , market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques . much of this violence has taken place in nigeria . but neighboring countries , such as cameroon and chad , have also been hit increasingly hard and have committed troops to fight the militants . an african __union-mandated__ multinational joint task force has also been formed , involving troops from cameroon , chad , niger and benin as well as nigeria . on friday , the uk foreign office announced britain would provide 5 million pounds -lrb- $ 7.4 million -rrb- to help the task force tackle boko haram . foreign secretary philip hammond expressed hope that the united nations security council would adopt a resolution , currently being negotiated , to endorse the task force . nana __karikari-apau__ contributed to this report from atlanta and susannah __cullinane__ wrote from london . christian __purefoy__ contributed from lagos .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- in washington , we are seeing the re-emergence this year of a phenomenon that many americans were afraid had gone extinct : real live __no-joke__ bipartisanship . heavyweights from both parties are attending the march 26 bipartisan summit on criminal justice reform . the event is co-produced by gingrich productions -lrb- on the right -rrb- and by my project , __#cut50__ -- an initiative that aims to safely halve the number of people behind bars within 10 years . attorney general eric holder will be speaking . so will newt gingrich , the republican former house speaker . sen. cory booker , d-new jersey , will be there . so will democratic strategist and cnn commentator donna brazile , a co-host of the summit . republican power players like former texas gov. rick perry , ohio gov. john kasich and sen. mike lee , __r-utah__ , will address the gathering by video . so will president obama . progressives like myself will rub shoulders with representatives from koch industries . everyone keeps asking me , `` how is this possible ? '' i have five words for you : `` liberty and justice for all . '' the ever-expanding incarceration industry has begun to violate some of the deepest and most sacred principles of both major political parties . therefore , conservatives , libertarians and liberals have their own objective interests in reform -- and their own __values-based__ incentives to make real changes . for example , the right takes very seriously the concept of `` liberty . '' conservatives and libertarians want to defend the rights of every individual to pursue his or her dreams . they favor limited government . they hate massive , failed , bloated government __bureaucracies__ that suck up more and more money and get more and more power , no matter how badly they perform . in america today , we have 5 % of the world 's population -- but we have nearly 25 % of the world 's incarcerated people . nearly 1 in 100 american adults is behind bars . one out of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is caged in america 's prisons and jails . and most people come out more damaged , more hopeless and less able to thrive than when they went in . -lrb- so much for `` corrections '' ! -rrb- . that 's the opposite of limited government -- and liberty . on the other hand , progressives like me care passionately about the `` justice for all '' part -- including racial justice and social justice . we are incensed by a system that locks up the poor and racial minorities in numbers that are massive -- and massively disproportionate . we oppose a system that forever __tars__ people as `` felons , '' deemed permanently unfit for employment or the right to vote , possibly because of one mistake , early in life . when any system violates the principles of both `` liberty '' and `` justice , '' americans of all stripes should stand together to change it . that is exactly what is starting to happen . this year , we are seeing the birth of an __honest-to-goodness__ `` liberty and justice for all '' coalition . still struggling to believe me ? i was on `` anderson cooper 360 '' on monday night to discuss the movement for criminal justice reform . here is a quote : . `` a lot of kids i grew up with , grammar school , middle school , high school , were in prison . they were the poor kids and they had drug addictions . they had drug problems , they did n't have any money , they got caught , and they got caught in the poverty cycle , and they are at the bottom of society and they ca n't get out of it . ... people with drug problems , people who have mental illnesses , they probably should n't be in the criminal justice system . and people who make mistakes , let 's not write them off forever , let 's give them a chance to reintegrate and __reenter__ society . '' there is just one catch : i 'm not the one who said that . that is a direct quote from mark holden , senior vice president of koch industries . on practically every other issue , the koch brothers and i are still fierce opponents . i doubt if we will ever agree on tax policy , campaign finance reform , environmental rules or the keystone pipeline , to name a few . but on criminal justice reform , it 's different . mark speaks eloquently about the way the criminal justice system violates the bill of rights and __criminalizes__ behaviors that should not result in prison terms . and he is not alone , on the right . fiscal conservatives decry the money wasted on a system that is too expensive and produces poor results . that 's one reason that __red-state__ governors , like georgia 's nathan deal , have acted boldly . leaders with roots on the religious right , including summit co-host pat nolan , insist on the christian value of redemption and second chances for those behind bars . our values may not always be identical , but they can find common expression in fixing this broken prison system . progressives and conservatives do n't have to trust each other -- or even like each other -- to vote together on this issue . usually , `` bipartisanship '' is just another word for cheap , political __gamesmanship__ . it is too often invoked by one side , simply to gain advantage and to cloak a more narrow set of interests . but on criminal justice reform , something different is happening . criminal justice reform is the one place where many republicans , democrats and libertarians actually agree -- and are willing to work together to get something done . over the last 30 years , both parties helped lead us down the path to mass incarceration . it will take both political parties to reverse course . perhaps the march 26 bipartisan summit will represent the first major bend in the road back toward sanity .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- actress __taraji__ p. henson is apologizing for claiming her son was racially profiled during a traffic stop in southern california last year . the glendale police department released dash cam video of the encounter friday , which contradicted her son 's claims . police released the footage after henson commented about the alleged profiling in an uptown magazine interview published last month . in her interview , the star of the hit television show `` empire '' said her son , __marcell__ johnson , 20 , was racially profiled in glendale and at the university of southern california , where she accused campus police of stopping him for `` having his hands in his pockets . '' after her son 's claim , she vowed to send him to howard university in washington instead . `` i 'm not paying $ __50k__ so i ca n't sleep at night wondering is this the night my son is getting racially profiled on campus , '' she said . even the university of southern california stepped in , with its public safety director , john thomas , saying he was disturbed by the report of the profiling , and was investigating it further . `` we encourage reporting of allegations of bias and i hope for the opportunity to have a conversation with the young man and his mother , '' thomas said . but henson retracted her accusations friday , and publicly apologized to the glendale police department . `` a mother 's job is not easy and neither is a police officer 's , '' she said in a post on instagram . `` sometimes as humans we overreact without gathering all of the facts . as a mother in this case i overreacted and for that i apologize . thank you to that officer for being kind to my son . '' police chief robert castro said his agency researched the traffic stop after her comments to the magazine . the incident started when a glendale officer pulled over johnson in october for failing to yield to a pedestrian at a cross walk . during the traffic stop , johnson admitted to having marijuana , an infraction and ritalin without a prescription , a felony , according to castro . he consented to a search of the vehicle , and officers found marijuana , honey oil -lrb- concentrated marijuana -rrb- , a marijuana grinder and a knife , castro said . johnson was not driving while impaired and was only cited for possession of marijuana , he said . `` misinformation that was reported in the story in uptown magazine with __taraji__ p. henson __impairs__ and weakens the relationships between law enforcement and the communities , '' castro said . the glendale police department said friday it appreciated henson 's apology and is sharing it with its officers .

'' all horses spend a minimum of two years being schooled at a purpose-built riding arena at the farm and also in the bush where they learn to deal with some of nature 's most intimidating creatures . `` when an __ex-racehorse__ sees a lion , '' explains philip __kusseler__ , `` you can feel it 's heartbeat through the saddle but he soon learns to cope with it and they are just as cool as any other horse breed . '' `` trekking with horses is extremely dangerous because the horse fits the lions prey preference perfectly . but they are so well-trained and so well disciplined that they do n't react like a prey animal would , so the lions get quite confused .

'' of course , there are other modes of transport with anything from trains to camels ready to carry you through the bush . most tourists still opt for a traditional four-wheel drive vehicles but the __kusselers__ would n't swap their thoroughbred horsepower for anything else . `` they are just lovely , '' says philip __kusseler__ . `` as long as you are able to stimulate them in the bush by having wonderful __outrides__ you will have a horse that keeps on smiling .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- charlottesville police said monday that investigators found no `` substantive basis '' to support a university of virginia female student 's story that she was raped at the phi kappa psi house , an account that rolling stone published last november . `` jackie '' told the magazine that in late september 2012 , she was assaulted at the house , the article said . police chief tim longo noted that just because police found no evidence to support her account , `` that does n't mean that something terrible did n't happen to jackie '' on the day in question . longo said he welcomed any information that might still be out there about the case . the rolling stone story generated controversy from the moment it came out , first sparking a debate about the prevalence of rape on college campuses throughout the country . but then the controversy turned toward the story 's content when apparent contradictions and discrepancies in the article came to light . rolling stone said it did not get the accounts of those accused in the piece , and apologized . editors vowed to conduct their own investigation , which is expected to be published in early april . longo said jackie did not give police a statement during their investigation . cnn legal analyst sunny hostin said it 's not unusual for a sexual assault victim to avoid the criminal process . `` sometimes they ca n't deal with the probing that occurs . they do n't want to submit to a rape kit . they 're embarrassed . they know that they will be scrutinized , quite frankly . so that in and of itself ... does n't make this young woman a liar , '' she said . hostin pointed out that only about 2 % of rapes that are reported are false , and only about 40 % of rapes that occur are even reported : `` so the suggestion that she just sort of made this entire thing up flies in the face of the statistics . '' nine out of 11 people at the fraternity house at the time the sexual assault allegedly occurred talked to police , longo said . none of them said they knew about a rape , he said , and investigators further determined that it was unlikely a party even happened at the fraternity house on the day in question as was alleged in the rolling stone story . the rolling stone reporter , sabrina rubin __erdely__ , talked to police , authorities said , but there were some questions she declined to answer for journalistic reasons . it 's unclear what those questions were . in total , authorities spoke to 70 people as part of their investigation , and just two believed that jackie was the victim of something , capt. gary __pleasants__ told cnn 's `` erin burnett outfront . '' `` the two of them were fairly convinced that something had happened -- not the way it was described , the way it was written . but they thought , again , that something had probably occurred , '' he said . after the story 's publication , uva suspended the fraternity 's activities , and outrage spread throughout campus as many struggled to comprehend the horrific experience that jackie said she endured . the article also suggested the school failed to respond to the alleged assault . phi kappa psi released a statement monday , saying the `` discredited '' story has done significant damage , while acknowledging the `` importance of sexual assault issues on america 's college campuses . '' the fraternity asked rolling stone to `` fully and unconditionally retract its story . '' rolling stone editors said they chose not to contact the man who allegedly orchestrated the attack on jackie , or any of the men she said participated in her alleged assault , `` because the editors feared retaliation against her , '' the magazine said , adding that it regretted that decision . `` in the face of new information , there now appear to be discrepancies in jackie 's account , and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced , '' rolling stone said in december . rolling stone managing editor will dana later tweeted that `` the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story . '' rolling stone issued an apology for discrepancies in its article and began to __fact-check__ it . steve __coll__ , dean of the columbia university graduate school of journalism , has been leading the independent review , cnn senior media correspondent brian __stelter__ reported sunday . __stelter__ said there has been much speculation about __coll__ 's findings . columbia university 's review will be published in early april in the magazine . `` i ca n't really say i 'm surprised since so much of the evidence was already called into question , '' a former friend of jackie 's said in response to what police found . `` i think it 's great that they 're staying open to considering any new evidence that comes up .

ARTICEL:     rome -lrb- cnn -rrb- as the dust settles after italy 's high court ruled on friday to overturn the latest guilty verdicts for amanda knox , 27 , and her former italian boyfriend raffaele sollecito , 31 , in the 2007 murder of meredith kercher , many questions still linger in the case . knox and sollecito were tried together and convicted of murder by two separate courts . but now they are free now , forever cleared . there wo n't be any civil trials like in the o.j. simpson case because , according to italian penal code , italy 's high court decision is final across all courts in the country . according to italian lawyer nicola __canestrini__ , who works on extradition and criminal cases between italy and other countries , . `` the high court decision is seen as the truth for the whole system . '' what now for the __kerchers__ ? francesco maresca , lawyer for the kercher family , told cnn that his clients are disappointed with the final ruling . `` we expected more from the italian judicial system , '' he said . `` this is a failure to find justice for meredith . '' maresca says the __kerchers__ could try to appeal to the european court of human rights and argue that italy failed to find those culpable of killing their beloved daughter and sister but they have yet to make that decision . `` if they think italy has n't fulfilled the duty , they could sue italy , '' __canestrini__ told cnn . such a claim could be made based on the final conviction handed down to rudy guede , a man from the ivory coast who was convicted for his role in kercher 's murder in 2008 in a fast-track trial that is still under seal . when the high court ruled definitively on his case in 2010 , they wrote explicitly in their reasoning that he was one of three assailants but did not name who they were . knox and sollecito both spent four years in prison during their initial trial and first appeal . they applied to italy 's high court to be put under house arrest but because knox was a foreigner and deemed a flight risk , they were both denied . sollecito may now have cause to sue italy for false imprisonment . italy pays around $ 12 million every year for locking up people who are later cleared of charges , according to italian prime minister matteo renzi who is introduced measures to reform the judicial system . but , __canestrini__ says if sollecito at any time lied to investigators before he was arrested , he may forfeit his right to reimbursement for being held . sollecito changed his story more than once before finally settling on an alibi with knox , so a legal battle could focus on whether anything he told investigators led directly to his arrest . __canestrini__ also says that knox could potentially sue italy for one year of false imprisonment , but because she admittedly lied to investigators early on which led to her arrest , she would likely not have much of a case . `` because she initially admitted to a role in the crime , she would n't likely win . if a suspect lies to investigators before they are arrested , it is difficult to prove they were falsely imprisoned , '' __canestrini__ says . in one of her initial interrogations in 2007 , she told investigators she was in the house when kercher was killed at which time she accused patrick lumumba , her boss at a pub where she worked , of the murder . she later recanted that statement , but lumumba spent two weeks in prison because of her false claim . in 2013 , italy 's high court ruled definitively on a slander charge against her for the false accusation and upheld a three-year prison term and ordered her to pay lumumba $ 40,000 euro . knox 's lawyer carlo __dalla__ __vedova__ told cnn that knox does n't feel any revenge or resentment towards italy . in fact , he said she will go back one day . `` this has been an nightmare for her , so we finally got the right decision , '' he said . `` we always thought this was the only decision possible . '' sollecito 's lawyers were equally pleased with the outcome . `` the verdict that we just received does n't prove us partly right , it proves us completely right , '' __giulia__ bongiorno told reporters outside the court . `` there were two possible verdicts : -lrb- one was to -rrb- overturn this verdict , but go back to it later . instead , the overturn is without any referral . among all the possible and imaginable overturning options , this is the one which says `` be advised , we wo n't ever even make the hypothesis of an implication of raffaele sollecito in this case ever . enough , enough , enough . '' knox , too , made her own statement from her mother 's home in seattle after hearing the news . she thanked all those who supported her innocence , and said she needed to take time to digest what being free really means . when asked if she had a message to the __kerchers__ about their daughter , she said , `` she deserved so much in this life . i 'm the lucky one . ''

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- vladimir putin is not a __self-effacing__ man . that 's why when the russian president suddenly disappeared from view people took notice . when russian officials tried to trick the public by passing off old photos as new appearances , speculation about putin 's whereabouts went viral . hashtags such as __#whereisputin__ and __#ПутинУмер__ -- russian for __#putinisdead__ -- became the tip of a giant social media iceberg , much of it streaked with dark humor . in ukraine , the neighboring state besieged by putin 's forces , someone reportedly left a large funeral wreath at the gate of the russian embassy . a handwritten message addressed putin with an expletive , telling him , `` thank you for __croaking__ . '' the fast-moving iceberg of speculation may melt as fast as it emerged . the kremlin has now started pushing harder against the rumors , trying to prove that russia 's foremost -- __nay__ , only -- major political leader , is alive and well . early on friday , officials released what they said was a picture of putin taken the day of . but on social media , onlookers accused officials of dusting off old images . those keeping track insist putin has not been seen since march 5 . regardless of how or when this speculation ends , it tells us much about the political realities of russia . this whole thing started after putin 's trip to kazakhstan was canceled on wednesday and a kazakh official told a reporter that the russian president had fallen ill . then the kremlin released a picture of putin speaking with the leader of the republic of __karelia__ . but it turns out that happened on march 4 . on thursday , putin 's spokesman , dmitry peskov , said the president would miss his regular meeting with the federal security service -lrb- fsb -rrb- . when asked about his boss 's health , peskov said he is `` absolutely healthy , '' his handshake so strong he could `` break your hand . '' to illustrate the point , the kremlin 's russia today posted a picture of the mighty president slamming a judo opponent hard against the ground . peskov says russia is in the grips of a `` spring fever '' that is causing people to dream up __harebrained__ scenarios . amateur __sleuths__ and creative minds have speculated wildly about putin 's health problems . the swiss magazine __blick__ said putin is in lugano , where his girlfriend just gave birth to their baby . some have said he has cancer ; others report a heart attack or a stroke . there are even suggestions that he went off to join isis , or is playing __hide-and-seek__ a la where 's waldo . does putin ever catch a cold ? does he ever get sick ? the kremlin does n't want to allow putin 's image of __virility__ and strength to become tarnished by the weaknesses of mere humans . that 's hardly surprising . putin is not your average president . on paper , russia is a democracy . but no objective observer believes that . putin is the state . every important decision is made by him . putin rules in the old-fashioned style of a personality cult . his approval ratings are __stratospheric__ , even if his brazen policies would warrant more significant levels of disagreement . approval ratings nearing 90 % are the product of suppression of dissent and media maneuvers __demonizing__ , ridiculing , and ultimately silencing critics . the system requires propaganda and image control . it needs putin to be larger than life . the recent murder of boris nemtsov , putin 's foremost critic , has spawned fears that there is a hit list , a roster of putin critics whose days are numbered . there are rampant rumors of intrigue inside the kremlin . the level of fear is said to be higher than it has been in years . the term `` __kremlinology__ '' became the study of intrigue and power machinations in __inscrutably__ dark systems . russia has a long history of concealing the illnesses of its leaders . in the soviet era , some mysterious disappearances were followed by funerals . in those days , there was usually a succession plan . and in the __post-stalin__ days , the passing of one leader meant that the party chose the next strongman . in 1991 , the last ussr leader , mikhail gorbachev , went to his summer home in crimea . he was visited by a group of high-ranking soviet officials . the next day , the russian people were told that gorbachev was ill , and could not perform his duties . gorbachev was held against his will . there was a coup in progress . putin 's mentor , president boris yeltsin , also had a history of `` disappearing '' from view . he was really ill and/or drunk . even if putin is in perfect health and the social media whirlwind turns out to have just been an outlet for creativity , talk of putin 's disappearance raises important questions . what would russia become if he suddenly left power ? is there a successor in place ? is there anyone who would continue putin 's policies ? if there is a power vacuum , a conceivable scenario given just how thoroughly putin dominates , what would the consequences be ? whatever putin is doing at this exact moment -- whether he is hunting tigers , visiting with friends , or __convalescing__ from an illness -- and no matter what he does in the days ahead , the internet tempest of the past few days is a reminder that the man who embodies today 's russian state , who dismantled the country 's __once-fledgling__ democracy , wo n't be around forever . which raises the question , what then ?

ARTICEL:     lagos , nigeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- a few months before nigeria 's national elections , both main candidates embraced and promised a peaceful election . that pledge is now under serious threat . protesters fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in nigeria 's oil-rich rivers state as they marched to protest national elections held to elect nigeria 's next president . `` there 's been so much violence in rivers state that it 's just not __tenable__ , '' said lai mohammed , spokesman for the main opposition party , the all peoples congress . the all peoples congress says the vote has been rigged , voters intimidated and demanded that the elections held in rivers state be canceled . the ruling party , the peoples democratic party , refutes the accusation , saying the election was `` credible and the result reflects the overwhelming wish of the people of rivers state to support president goodluck jonathan . '' heavy rain eventually forced the protesters home , but there are fears that it will take more than rain to stop further protests and violence . `` we are concerned by what seems to be happening , '' said __attahiru__ __jega__ , nigeria 's election chairman , about events in rivers state . nigeria has just held what are thought to be the closest elections since a return to democracy in 1999 after decades of military rule . the two main candidates are incumbent president goodluck jonathan and retired general __muhammedu__ __buhari__ . what is at stake in the protests in rivers state is not whether nigeria can hold an election , but can it hold a `` close '' election . voting is now over and the results are being counted . __jega__ says the final result will likely be announced within 48 hours . the fear is that the results may not be accepted by whomever loses . and if the opposition believes it has been rigged out of victory by the ruling party , then the protests in rivers state could spread to northern nigeria . over 800 people were killed in post-election violence across the north after the 2011 elections were thought to be illegitimate . and so both candidates have taken to social media to call for calm . `` i want to urge all nigerians to also wait patiently for the independent national electoral commission , __inec__ , to __collate__ and announce results , '' stated jonathan on his facebook account . `` fellow nigerians , i urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced , '' said __buhari__ on twitter .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- there were screams . then the sounds of a commercial jetliner slamming into the mountainside . and finally silence . deathly silence . that much is known about the final few minutes for the 144 passengers on __germanwings__ flight __9525__ . beyond that , it 's a matter of imagination and speculation -- about what they saw and what they felt as their plane approached and then crashed into the alps . none of them can speak for themselves , nor can any of the flight 's six crew members . but authorities have given some clues , based on what investigators know about the aircraft 's trajectory and what they 've heard on a mangled cockpit voice recorder recovered at the crash site . it all began on what seemed like most any other tuesday as citizens of 18 countries packed into the __germanwings__ plane in barcelona , spain . the passengers came from all walks of life , using lufthansa 's low-cost carrier to get to dusseldorf , germany . they were high school students , heading home after a week in spain . they were parents and children enjoying their vacation . there were businessmen , scouting out store locations . there was a __26-minute__ delay before takeoff because air traffic controllers did n't give the ok to start the plane 's engines earlier and there was a small wait in the takeoff rotation , according to lufthansa . for any frequent flier , that kind of delay is nothing abnormal . nor , it seems , was takeoff . the airbus a320 left and headed northeast at 10:01 a.m. -lrb- __5:01__ a.m. et -rrb- on what should have been a __726-mile__ journey . the plane leveled off at 38,000 feet , its cruising altitude . by this point , passengers would be ok to __unbuckle__ , head to the restroom or get their bags out of the overhead bin . a seemingly innocuous act changed everything : the aircraft 's pilot had to use the restroom , according to lufthansa ceo __carsten__ __spohr__ , telling the co-pilot that he was stepping out . it 's possible that passengers saw the captain in the cabin , going to or from the restroom . they also could have noticed that the aircraft was going down -- even though they were about a half-hour into a nearly two-hour flight , with the alps ahead of them . the passengers could n't have known it , but the co-pilot -- identified as 28-year-old andreas __lubitz__ -- `` manipulated the buttons of the flight monitoring system to activate the descent of the aircraft '' while the pilot was out , marseille prosecutor brice robin said thursday . this was around 10:45 a.m. . it was n't like the plane suddenly __jerked__ down , plunging straight into the ground . authorities described a steady descent at a rate of about 3,000 to 3,500 feet -lrb- or roughly 1,000 meters -rrb- per minute . still , it is the kind of descent you 'd expect while nearing an airport -- not traversing the alps . if passengers did n't notice that fall , they might have caught wind of what was happening at the front of the plane . students , singers among the victims . inside the cockpit , the only sound was that of __lubitz__ breathing steadily . but outside the cockpit , the noises apparently grew louder and more frantic . the pilot tried to open the door but could n't get in . he likely knocked on the door . he used a video conference system to talk to the co-pilot , robin said . none of it worked . nor did his last-ditch attempt , as recounted by a senior french military official involved in the crash investigation to the new york times . `` you can hear he is trying to smash the door down , '' the official said . did the passengers hear this commotion upfront ? it 's hard to imagine they did n't . and if that was n't reason enough to cause worry , they just had to look outside -- at the mountain chain that should have been far below them instead of getting closer and closer and closer . the voice recorder did n't indicate any abnormal noise in the cabin until the final few moments . still , even if the passengers did n't know it at the time , all it took was eight minutes for a seemingly normal flight to become a nightmare . the nightmare ended in a violent crash into rugged , remote terrain . so did the screams and the lives of all 150 people on flight __9525__ -- a death that robin described as `` instantaneous . '' who was co-pilot andreas __lubitz__ ?
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     __germanwings__ flight __9525__ had a slight delay before taking off from barcelona , spain . after leveling off at 38,000 feet , the plane descended steadily before hitting the alps . screams were heard in plane 's cabin in minutes before crash , according to audio recording .

'' that would usher in a whirlwind of activity on capitol hill in the next year as new york 's senior senator prepares to seize the reins of power -- and __retool__ the party as a center-left powerhouse that can win and hold a majority in 2016 and beyond . left-leaning activists have begun scrambling to block chuck schumer 's rise . the progressive organization democracy for america is calling for sen. elizabeth warren to seek the leadership post , and the left-leaning daily kos website is circulating a poll seeking other challengers and denouncing schumer as too close to the `` wall street wing '' of the democratic party . with more than a year to go before senate democrats will choose a new leader , anything can happen . but after watching schumer in action for more than 20 years , i 'd be surprised if he gets __outsmarted__ in a political moment he has literally been working for a generation to create . with more than $ 13.4 million on hand in his campaign coffers , schumer has more money than all but one member of the senate -- and is the only democrat in the top 10 in that category . he ran the democratic senatorial campaign committee when it took the majority in 2006 -- and while democrats lost the majority during his second stint in the job in 2012 , the field looks far more promising for them in 2016 : republicans must defend 24 seats , while democrats need to protect only 10 . schumer brings an extraordinary level of personal political skill to the leadership fight . even among the __100-member__ senate -- home to a great many ambitious politicians with big egos -- schumer has long operated at a high-octane level of smarts and __media-savvy__ __brashness__ that impress and occasionally __startle__ his colleagues . republican bob dole , a longtime lion of the senate , once quipped that the most dangerous place to be in the capitol is between schumer and a television camera . the joke stuck -- but behind the gag is a sign of __grudging__ respect for a man who __excels__ at the basic __block-and-tackle__ necessities of political life . schumer is attuned to television and radio -lrb- growing up in the world 's media capital will do that -rrb- . in fact , he popularized a practice of holding press conferences on sunday , a slow news day guaranteed to draw reporters -- and ensure him prominent placement in the monday newspapers . but he is also a consummate street politician : at 64 , he maintains a habit of biking around new york city neighborhoods without fanfare or an entourage , quietly noting local problems and occasionally inviting himself into a block party or parade . when a reporter once casually asked him to name all 62 counties of new york state , schumer did her one better , and __hand-sketched__ a map of the state with all the counties filled in . -lrb- he visits every county in the state every year . -rrb- . schumer is n't the only politically ambitious kid from brooklyn -- before attending harvard , he graduated from a public school , james madison high , whose alumni include supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg , sen. bernie sanders and __ex-sen__ . norm coleman of minnesota -lrb- a childhood pal of schumer 's -rrb- . but schumer 's political climb been a long-term work in progress . he emerged on the national stage as a prime sponsor of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 , a law that banned assault weapons ; in the run-up to the final vote , new yorkers practically could n't turn on television without seeing schumer , then a congressman , on the floor of the house , waving a rifle over his head as he argued for the ban . the higher profile served him well a few years later , when schumer took on -- and defeated -- three-term incumbent sen. __alfonse__ __d'amato__ . as a senator on the rise , schumer attracted politically ambitious staffers who moved on to high-profile positions where they can help their former mentor . a very partial list of those includes howard wolfson , phil singer and blake __zeff__ , who went on to help run hillary clinton 's 2008 campaign ; ben __lawsky__ , who is now shaking up the world of finance as new york 's top banking regulator ; preet bharara , who has become an anti-corruption powerhouse as a u.s. attorney ; and rodney __capel__ , who is executive director of the state 's democratic party . with allies , money and the blessing of reid , schumer is in a prime position to implement the ideas contained in his important and overlooked 2007 book , `` positively american , '' which lays out a vision for how democrats should lead america . like schumer himself , the book is savvy , hopeful and politically attuned to the desires of middle-class voters . those who wonder what a schumer senate leadership would look like should take a look as democrats prepare for what could well be the start of the schumer era on capitol hill .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- it is now generally accepted that __germanwings__ first officer andreas __lubitz__ did indeed lock his captain out of the cockpit , put their airplane into a steep descent , and then sit back and wait calmly for the end to arrive . he did it with premeditation , having discarded a doctor 's note that would have excused him from work that day . he joins the short and infamous list of airline pilots , a handful over the past two decades , who have used their airplanes to combine suicide with mass murder . why is this thought at once so fascinating and so horrifying ? it is because of the __incompatibility__ between what we want to believe about flying and what we now see . air travel presents itself as a highly controlled , __stringently__ professional activity , stripped of every unpredictable element . flight crews wear military-style uniforms not because they could not fly equally well in street clothes , but because uniforms convey to passengers a __subliminal__ suggestion that they are of a different breed , as far from ordinary folk as a world-class athlete is from a __duffer__ . not only are pilots smarter and __better-trained__ than ordinary people , those stripes and caps say , but they also must be less forgetful than we , less __distractible__ , better rested , not prone to irritability or sadness or smoldering __resentments__ . like soldiers , they must be just a little bit robotic , efficient , brave and purified of the trash that __infests__ the souls of common humans . because they have earned their stripes , we feel safe -- even when it seems impossible for us to understand , or apparently for anyone to explain , what keeps those huge metal contraptions up in the air . the truth , as the voluminous history of airplane accidents reveals , is that pilots are not different from other people . they can be careless , lazy , __inattentive__ and reckless . they can drink too much . when pilots talk among themselves , the mistakes , the close calls , the disasters averted by sheer luck are favorite topics . but if pilots slip up in little ways from time to time , the sweeping drama of aviation , in which they are the actors and we the audience , eclipses their faults . besides , most flying is routine -- hours of boredom , the cliché goes , punctuated by moments of sheer terror . the glitches have long since been ironed out , and the airplanes are so wonderfully engineered that they usually protect even the worst pilot from himself . nor are pilots of a higher moral type than the rest of us . despite the __pieties__ they occasionally utter , pilots do not consciously shoulder the burden of hundreds of lives or feel more responsible for a full airplane than for an empty one . pilots , by and large , are proud . they identify with the airplane ; it is an extension and enlargement of the self , and the pilot feels the same motive to deliver it safely to its destination as you feel when driving a car on a crowded freeway . a pilot values a smooth landing because it demonstrates skill , not because the people in back are still alive . the greatest guarantee you have that your pilot is devoted to your safety is the fact that he or she is in the airplane with you . so we should not be overly astonished if from time to time a pilot does something completely incompatible with our confidence . pilots are drawn from the diverse pool of human types . the human mind is the __blackest__ of boxes ; no one , neither colleague nor psychologist , can reliably peer inside it . desperate , cataclysmic acts occur almost daily all over the world ; why should they not occur , once in a long while , in cockpits ? perhaps , with time , we will understand better who andreas __lubitz__ was and what he did . today , we still know very little .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- from the community of __montoursville__ , pennsylvania , u.s.a. , to the community of __haltern__ am see , germany : . we offer our heartfelt condolences for the pain you must be feeling at this time after the loss of 16 students and two teachers in the horrendous crash of __germanwings__ flight __9525__ . there are no words of comfort that we could express that would ever be adequate . we know something about this sorrow . almost 19 years ago our community lost 16 high school french club students , along with five __chaperones__ , in the crash of twa flight 800 off the coast of long island , new york . it is impossible to be prepared for such a horrific tragedy that touches so many so personally . during the dark hours of waiting for word of possible survivors from flight 800 , the pain for the family members was excruciating . as word came that there were no survivors , that all hope was extinguished , the anguish became almost unbearable . students , former students , teachers and other community members began to fill the hallways of the high school building because they did n't know where else to go to find consolation . local pastors , priests , teachers and counselors were also gathering at the school to offer whatever comfort could be offered in such a moment . within hours , phone calls began pouring in from former students and teachers who were now living outside the area , offering condolences and prayers for all . since the disaster occurred over water , the recovery of loved ones took days , and even weeks in some cases . positive identification of each individual lost took even longer , which only added to the anguish . the __identifications__ came in one at a time over a period of several days ; the waiting was nearly impossible to bear . school was not in session during the summer months , so students and school staff members were able to express their sense of loss as they felt necessary at any time . a community prayer service was arranged and held in the high school gymnasium to provide a place to weep together , and to share each other 's pain . local pastors and priests provided ongoing support to the families who had lost family members , and this continued for several months . some struggled so deeply that professional counseling was suggested . because we are a community of about 5,000 with just one high school , almost everyone opened their arms of support to those in deepest need by providing meals , __baby-sitting__ , __housecleaning__ and laundry services . funeral services were held one at a time , some in the high school and others in local churches . long lines of mourners waited in silence for the opportunity to at least offer condolences to family members . twenty-one funeral services over a period of several days left many in the community without any more tears to cry . within a couple of months , a memorial service was held on the local athletic field and attended by thousands . the hope was to bring closure for the community so it could attempt to return to a somewhat normal daily routine . this helped for some , but families that experienced direct loss still had a long and painful journey ahead of them . when a parent , or someone serving as a parent , loses a child , an empty spot occurs in the heart that never heals . they may find comfort in the thought that their child is in the arms of a loving god , but that assurance does not mend the broken heart . over time , the various families that lost their children in the tragedy formed support groups to share their loss . many of the folks have reached out to others going through a similar type of loss to offer their comfort , and have found a little bit of personal healing in the process . in the years since the crash , many of the pastors and priests who served the families have moved away or retired from pastoral service . those of us who counseled from the beginning have at times needed the support of one another to restore our strength and spirits to then be able to serve our own parishioners . this is the beginning of a very long journey for all those willing to serve those in such great pain at this time . at this writing i am shedding tears just recalling the events that started almost 19 years ago . if any of our experiences can assist your community of __haltern__ am see in getting through this horrible event , then know that it is in pain we achieve our greatest victories .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- isis apparently claimed responsibility thursday for the deadly terrorist attack at a landmark museum in the heart of that country 's capital , a mass shooting that has shaken the birthplace of the arab spring and stirred questions about militants in the country . in an audio statement posted online thursday , isis identified two men -- abu __zakariya__ __al-tunisi__ and abu anas __al-tunisi__ -- it said used `` automatic weapons and hand grenades '' to kill and injure what it called `` crusaders and __apostates__ '' in the __bardo__ museum in tunis . tunisian health minister said __aidi__ said 23 people are believed to have been killed , including at least one who died at a hospital overnight . and that bloodshed , the isis message warned , is `` just the start . '' cnn can not independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement . a u.s. official told cnn there is no reason to doubt the claim 's authenticity . that said , american officials are checking the platform that the statement went out on , including the extent to which it 's tied to the group calling itself the islamic state . the current u.s. thinking is the attack may have been carried out by local `` franchise '' adherents to isis , rather than centrally directed by the islamist extremist group 's leadership , which is now thought to be in syria . the two attackers were carrying explosives , tunisian president __beji__ __caid__ __essebsi__ said in an interview thursday with the french broadcaster __tf1__ . he credited tunisian security forces for responding so quickly to the attack to avoid a larger tragedy because `` terrible explosives were found on these -lrb- attackers -rrb- and they did n't have time to use them . '' tunisia has been viewed as the lone democratic success story in the arab spring . but the north african nation is not without its issues , including an uneven economy and the distinction of having more citizens -- up to 3,000 tunisians -- thought to have gone to iraq and syria to fight as jihadists than any other country , according to the international centre for the study of radicalization in london . authorities there have already arrested nine people in connection with wednesday 's attack , including four directly linked to the bloodshed , according to a statement from __essebsi__ . earlier thursday , tunisian prime minister habib __essid__ identified two suspects , __yassine__ __labidi__ and saber __khachnaou__ , in an interview with french radio station rtl . it 's not clear if those two men were the pair killed at the museum by tunisian security forces , or if it 's possible they 're the same people as those identified -- using new names -- in isis ' audio statement . __labidi__ was `` known to the security services , he was flagged and monitored , '' __essid__ said . but he added the man was n't known or being followed for anything special . the siege took place just days after a tunisian jihadist tweeted that a pledge of allegiance to abu bakr al-baghdadi , the leader of isis , was coming soon , according to the site intelligence group , which monitors terrorist propaganda . in his message , the jihadist claimed to belong to __jund__ __al-khilafah__ in tunisia , a group that in december pledged allegiance to isis , even though that vow had n't seemed to have fully registered with the islamist extremist group . his post comes after an isis fighter in the extremist group 's stronghold of raqqa in syria recently appeared in a video questioning why militants in tunisia had not pledged __fealty__ . `` this raises the possibility that the museum attack could be isis ' debut on the tunisian stage , timed to __precede__ a pledge of allegiance from tunisian jihadis for maximum impact , '' cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank said . the attack may have been in and about tunisia , but the vast majority of the victims were foreigners . they came from various backgrounds , from a spanish couple to a colombian mother and son . in addition to those pairs , the dead included three italians , three japanese , two french , two poles , a belgian , a russian and a briton , according to cruise ship companies and their respective governments . three tunisians , one of them a security officer and another a job applicant , also were killed , according to __aidi__ . twelve of those killed had been aboard the msc __splendida__ , a cruise ship with more than 3,700 passengers and nearly 1,300 crew that docked in tunis hours before the bloodshed , its parent company said in a statement . five more victims came from a similar vessel , the costa __fascinosa__ , which was at port in the tunisian capital at the same time , according to costa cruises . another 36 people remain hospitalized , while eight others were treated and released . the __bardo__ had been a logical stop for these tourists , housed next to tunisia 's parliament in a 19th century palace and cast as a `` jewel of tunisian heritage , '' with its exhibits showcasing the country 's art , culture and history . its prominent place in tunisia 's economy -- which banks heavily on tourism , with millions visiting the country each year -- also made it a logical target for terrorists . `` they hit the heart of our livelihood , '' said mohammed ali __troudi__ , a taxi driver in tunis . it 's too early to tell how tourists will react to the attack . both the msc __splendida__ and the costa __fascinosa__ have since left tunis , even as the search continues for some of their missing passengers -- at least four from the __splendida__ and two from the __fascinosa__ , according to their respective companies . the question is whether more __passenger-packed__ cruise ships , as well as commercial airliners filled with tourists , will come to tunisia in the future . travelers warned of risks as tunisia reels from attack . the economy and terrorism are linked in tunisia , in the sense that high youth unemployment and sparse opportunities are thought to have contributed to the large numbers becoming jihadists -- whether abroad or at home . attacking what tunisian lawmaker __sabrine__ __ghoubantini__ called `` a symbol of sovereignty in tunisia '' likely wo n't help . `` it 's really sad , '' __ghoubantini__ told cnn from tunis , `` and i hope that it wo n't really affect our economy . '' the government has been battling a jihadist presence in the __chaambi__ mountains . and in february , the country 's interior ministry announced the arrests of about 100 alleged extremists and published a video allegedly showing that the group possessed a formula for making explosives and a photograph of isis leader al-baghdadi . __mehrezia__ __labidi__ , another parliamentarian , says it 's imperative that the message gets across to would-be jihadists that `` life in democracy is better than '' what terrorist recruiters are telling them . `` we have really to work on the culture , the level of ideas , '' she said . meanwhile , she and others stressed that the vast majority of tunisians -- including __secular-minded__ citizens and moderate islamists -- need to come together for their country and against these extremist views and tactics . `` they are trying to terrify us . but the whole tunisian people is unified -- all the parties , all the civil society organizations , all the countries are unified , '' __ghoubantini__ said . '' ... i 'm sure that we will fight terrorism and that we will really eradicate it from our country .

ARTICEL:     london -lrb- cnn -rrb- a supporter of suspended `` top gear '' host jeremy clarkson delivered a petition with nearly 1 million signatures calling for his reinstatement to the bbc 's headquarters in london on friday -- driving an armored tank up to the building . clarkson was suspended for allegedly hitting a producer , the bbc reported last week , and `` top gear '' -- a highly popular show with a big global audience -- was not broadcast as scheduled sunday . the bbc 's decision to take the show off the air pending an investigation has outraged many of clarkson 's die-hard fans . more than __990,000__ of them have signed the petition posted on change.org by guido fawkes , a right-wing political blogger , just a week ago . whether the show of support will have any impact on the bbc 's response is unclear . clarkson tweeted his thanks friday night to those who are calling for his reinstatement , saying he is `` very touched . '' the findings of the internal investigation are due to be presented to the corporation 's director general next week , the bbc said thursday . `` once this has been considered , we will set out any further steps , '' a statement said . the bbc said in an earlier statement that clarkson , one of the corporation 's highest earners , had `` a fracas with a bbc producer . '' in an indication of its popularity , `` top gear '' was named as the world 's most widely watched factual program in the guinness world records 2013 edition book , with an estimated 350 million global viewers . the show is sold to 214 territories worldwide . clarkson vented his apparent frustration in an __expletive-filled__ speech thursday night in what seemed to be a spontaneous appearance at a charity auction in north london . a cnn reporter who was at the event heard clarkson swear __liberally__ as he talked about his suspension from the show , saying the bbc `` have f ***** themselves '' and that it had ruined a great show . clarkson also auctioned what he said would be one final lap of the `` top gear '' track in surrey , outside london -- used in the show for putting vehicles through their paces -- for # 100,000 -lrb- $ __148,000__ . -rrb- it 's not clear whether he had the authority to offer the use of the track for auction -- but his words seem to suggest he does n't expect his bbc career to continue , even if no decision is expected before next week . `` i did n't foresee my sacking , but i would like to do one last lap , '' clarkson said . `` so i 'll go down to surrey , and i 'll do one last lap of that track before the f ****** b ******* sack me . '' whoever placed the winning bid would be able to ride in a car with him on that lap , he said , or in a rare __laferrari__ supercar owned by a friend . clarkson , who 's been presenting the show since the late 1980s , added , `` i 'll be a bit tearful when i do it . '' the controversial star has at least one influential ally -- uk prime minister david cameron . `` i do n't know exactly what happened , '' cameron told the bbc last week . `` he 's a constituent of mine , a friend of mine . he 's a huge talent . `` because he is such a huge talent and he __amuses__ and entertains so many people , including my children , who 'd be heartbroken if ` top gear ' was taken off air , i hope this can be sorted out , because it 's a great program and he 's a great talent . '' opinion : why we crave the abuse of jeremy clarkson . it is not the first time that clarkson has been at the center of controversy . last may , the television star asked for forgiveness after using a racist term during a taping of the show . clarkson had mumbled the n-word while reciting a children 's nursery rhyme , but that version of the take was never aired . last year , the bbc show hit the headlines when argentina complained about a `` top gear '' special filmed in the country in which the number plate __h982__ __fkl__ was used -- interpreted by some as a reference to the 1982 falklands war . forced to stop filming and leave the country , clarkson said on the bbc __newsbeat__ website that the use of the plate was purely coincidental . in a previous article on its website , the bbc said `` jeremy clarkson is not a man given to considered opinion . '' journalist monica __sarkar__ contributed to this report .

'' houthi militants took over the airport in taiz as they swept through the city and surrounding province , two officials with the taiz provincial government said . one civilian was killed and 82 others wounded when the rebels fired at local residents protesting their presence , the officials said . the rebels have also seized security and intelligence buildings in taiz and set up checkpoints in the area , the officials said . taiz , about 390 kilometers -lrb- 240 miles -rrb- south of sanaa , is yemen 's cultural capital . the rebels -- shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country -- surrounded the presidential palace in january . yemen 's president and his cabinet resigned days later . ousted president abdu __rabu__ mansour hadi says his resignation was n't valid and maintains that he remains the country 's leader . in a statement sunday , the united nations security council backed hadi , calling for all sides to end armed hostilities and work out differences at the negotiating table . `` peaceful dialogue is the only way forward , '' said jamal __benomar__ , the u.n. 's special adviser on yemen . but he gave a dire assessment of the current situation , saying the country is in a `` rapid downward spiral '' and at `` the edge of civil war . '' this is n't the first time the u.n. security council has weighed in on the mounting tensions . last month the council slammed the rebels for taking over democratic institutions and holding officials under house arrest . but so far , it seems calls for calm from around the world have done little to quell the violence . last week , a yemeni jet commanded by the houthi fired missiles at a palace housing hadi in the port city of aden . no one was injured , but the direct strike marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides . that same day , yemeni military forces -- some under the houthis , others led by officers loyal to hadi -- battled in aden , leaving at least 13 people dead in the clashes , aden gov. abdulaziz __hobtour__ said . there are growing concerns that terror groups such as al qaeda in the arabian peninsula and isis could take advantage of the chaos to mount attacks and spread their reach . bombings at two mosques in sanaa last week killed at least 137 people and wounded hundreds more . isis claimed responsibility in a statement posted on a site that has published previous statements from the group . on saturday the state department said the u.s. military had pulled its remaining personnel out of yemen due to the deteriorating security situation . journalist hakim __almasmari__ reported from sanaa , cnn 's catherine e. shoichet reported from atlanta and cnn 's richard roth reported from the united nations . cnn 's anas hamdan , greg botelho , hamdi alkhshali , ed payne and laura koran contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- thousands of __singaporeans__ gathered in pouring rain sunday to bid farewell to lee __kuan__ yew , the southeast asian city-state 's founding prime minister who charted its spectacular economic rise . draped in the national flag , lee 's coffin was taken on a solemn procession through the sodden streets of the tropical city , where crowds of mourners defied the downpour to pay their last respects . the funeral service was attended by dozens of foreign dignitaries , including former u.s. president bill clinton and indian prime minister narendra modi . `` the light that has guided us all these years has been extinguished . we have lost our founding father mr. lee __kuan__ yew , who lived and breathed singapore all his life , '' singaporean prime minister lee __hsien__ __loong__ , who is one of lee 's sons , said in a eulogy . lee died early monday morning at age 91 , prompting an outpouring of grief and tributes from around the world . he had been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia on february 5 . born in 1923 , lee co-founded singapore , a former british colony , in 1965 when it declared its independence from malaysia . he served as its prime minister for more than three decades , shaping the once poor trading post into a wealthy financial center . he continued to play an important role in government until his final years . after lee 's death , hundreds of thousands of people joined huge lines to pay respects to the former leader as his body lay in state at singapore 's parliament house for several days last week . the procession sunday weaved past a number of notable singapore landmarks on the way to the university cultural centre , where the state funeral service took place . `` together , we came not only to mourn . together , we celebrate mr. lee __kuan__ yew 's long and full life , and what he has achieved with us , his people , '' his son said in his eulogy . lee was also honored by a __21-gun__ salute and a minute of silence , as well as displays by the singapore air force and the singapore navy . the funeral service was to be followed by a private cremation . other international figures attending the funeral included japanese prime minister shinzo abe , australian prime minister tony abbott , leader of the u.k. house of commons william hague and former u.s. secretary of state henry kissinger . although lee is admired for the economic success he helped singapore achieve , he also drew criticism for curbing media freedoms and the treatment of political opponents . `` while remembering his deeds that helped build singapore up to what it is today , the government should also mark the passing of lee __kuan__ yew , by making a break from the politics of yesteryear that were too often marked by restrictions on basic civil and political rights , '' phil robertson , deputy director of human rights watch 's asia division , said in a statement sunday .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- manchester united and skipper wayne rooney significantly boosted its own chances and delivered a probable knockout blow to tottenham hotspur 's hopes of champions league qualification with 3-0 home win sunday . first half goals from marouane fellaini , michael carrick and rooney effectively ended the epl match as a contest , with the win leaving united in fourth spot , but only two points adrift of second-placed manchester city . tottenham is seventh , six points adrift of the top four . rooney 's third after another piece of disastrous defending from the visitors led to an impromptu and topical goal celebration , which was certainly the main talking point . a national newspaper had posted a video on on social media sunday which appeared to show rooney being felled by fellow epl footballer and former united teammate phil bardsley as both donned boxing gloves for a `` friendly '' fight in his kitchen . after he had converted following a mistake by nabil bentaleb , rooney threw a few mock punches then __keeled__ over backwards on to the old trafford turf . tottenham 's players and fans were probably the only people not to see the funny side , but the joke was on them , having gone into the match seeking a third straight away win at united and five games unbeaten against the red devils . from united first significant attack on nine minutes , an unmarked fellaini was found by carrick and the belgian international beat hugo lloris with a low shot . fellaini caused chaos in the tottenham defense for the second with carrick left free to head home from distance . rooney 's emphatic strike after bentaleb gifted him possession , proved the icing on the cake . the victory eases the pressure on manager louis van gaal and his __expensively__ assembled side after some lackluster recent performances and last monday 's disappointing fa cup exit to arsenal . it meant tottenham , off the back of two straight wins and with harry kane in top form , was favored going into the crucial match , but the young striker barely had a glimpse of goal , until having his side 's first shot on target after fully 88 minutes as united dominated . earlier , chelsea extended its lead at the top of the epl to six points but was held 1-1 at home to southampton in another less than convincing performance from jose mourinho 's team . off the back of a disappointing champions league exit to paris saint germain , chelsea again struggled to find its best form at stamford bridge despite going in front from diego costa 's 18th league goal . dusan __tasic__ equalized from the spot for the saints after nemanja matic was adjudged to have fouled sadio mane , with chelsea protests waved away . chelsea found fraser forster hard to beat and the visiting goalkeeper made fine saves from oscar , eden hazard and juan cuadrado to deny the leaders three points . however , it has a commanding lead plus a game in hand over chasing manchester city , which lost 1-0 to burnley saturday , in a severe blow to hopes of retaining the title . in sunday 's other epl clash , everton eased its relegation fears with a 3-0 win over newcastle , who had fabricio coloccini sent off for a foul on aaron lennon , who is on loan at goodison from tottenham . in la liga , gareth bale snapped a recent lean spell of scoring form with both goals as real madrid beat levante 2-0 in the bernabeu . the record signing struck first in the 17th minute when cristiano ronaldo 's acrobatic effort was cleared off the line and the welshman scored the rebound . the same combination was at work for the second in the 40th minute with ronaldo 's strike helped into the visiting net by bale . ronaldo might have added to the tally and missed several opportunities but real was never threatened by levante and eased to the three points . it leaves them a point adrift of barcelona ahead of next weekend 's el clasico , which could go a long way to determining the title race .

ARTICEL:     los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- three area residents were arrested and charged wednesday for allegedly operating four southern california schools for korean and chinese students who never attended classes and lived in other states on student visas in a `` __pay-to-stay__ '' scheme . the three educators collected as much as $ 6 million in annual tuition from an enrollment of about 1,500 foreign students who were largely from south korea and china , said federal prosecutors . the arrests came after a federal grand jury indicted the three defendants tuesday on charges of conspiracy to commit immigration fraud , money laundering and other immigration offenses . an allegation in the indictment would also require the defendants to forfeit property and proceeds derived from the fraudulent scheme , authorities said . hee sun __shim__ , 51 , of beverly hills , is the owner and manager and of the __postsecondary__ schools and is charged with 13 counts of use or possession of an immigration document procured by fraud , authorities said . the two other defendants are each charged with one count of that same offense : they are __hyung__ chan moon , also known as steve moon , 39 , of los angeles who assisted in the operation and management of the schools ; and __eun__ young choi , also known as jamie choi , 32 , of los angeles , a former employee who also assisted in the operation and management of the school . __shim__ , who also went by leonard __shim__ and leo __shim__ , is also charged with three counts of encouraging illegal residence , as well as two counts of money laundering , prosecutors said . the three defendants and their attorneys could n't be immediately reached for comment wednesday . `` immigration fraud schemes potentially compromise national security and cheat foreign nationals who play by the rules , '' acting u.s. attorney stephanie __yonekura__ said in a statement . `` in this case , officials at several schools allegedly abused their responsibility to ensure that only legitimate foreign students were allowed to the stay in the country . this type of fraud against the united states will be thoroughly examined to bring those responsible to justice and to protect the integrity of our immigration system , '' the federal prosecutor said . three of the schools are in los angeles ' __koreatown__ neighborhood : __prodee__ __university/neo-america__ language school ; walter jay m.d. institute , an educational center -lrb- __wjmd__ -rrb- ; and the american college of forensic studies -lrb- __acfs__ -rrb- , authorities said . the fourth school is currently operating in alhambra , california : __likie__ fashion and technology college , authorities said . `` what we 've broken up is a __pay-to-stay__ scheme , '' said claude arnold , special agent in charge of the los angeles office of u.s. immigration and customs enforcement . `` that 's a scheme where institutions purport to be schools , but are really not doing any education whatsoever , '' he said . `` any scheme where someone gains access to the u.s. through fraud is also a national security vulnerability , '' arnold said . `` although we do n't have any information that any of these people wish to do harm to the u.s. , the point is anyone could take advantage of a vulnerability like this . which is why it is so important that we identify these vulnerabilities and shut them down . '' __prodee__ __university/neo-america__ language school was located on the fifth floor of a los angeles office tower near the __koreatown__ neighborhood , but homeland security investigations agents said they found the school `` abandoned '' during their raid on wednesday . the agents allowed cnn to attend the raid . the school featured classrooms , administrative offices and a small library , but no one occupied the spaces . in fact , the abandoned school brought to mind a movie set , filled with props and decorations , but no actors . in one small room , a cd player serenaded empty desks with classical music . the tiny library featured usc and ucla __pennants__ . the television was n't even plugged in . one federal agent said many of the students listed on the school rolls were older , in their 30s , 40s and 50s . __prodee__ 's 2011-2012 catalog describes the facility as an english as second language school and states `` it is our mission that all students be able to flourish in their ability to use and understand english in all facets of life by providing a top quality __esl__ educational environment , '' according to a copy of the document on the website of the california bureau for private __postsecondary__ education . `` our enthusiastic and qualified instructors concern themselves with teaching a rigorous , but innovative curriculum of interactive and beneficial courses and materials leading to higher __toefl__ scores and admission to u.s. colleges and universities , '' the catalog says . another document with the state bureau indicates __prodee__ had a 73 % graduation rate in 2011 and a 60 % rate in 2010 . but the indictment alleges that students actually lived nevada , texas , washington state and arizona . the schools were authorized by the federal government to issue a document that certified a foreign student had been accepted to a school and would be attending classes full time in the united states , authorities said . the document , called a form __i-20__ , made a student eligible for a __f-1__ student visa . in exchange for that form , students paid $ 1,800 tuition to enroll in one of the schools for six months , authorities said . during their investigation , authorities interviewed 35 students , mainly from south korea , and found none resided in los angeles , officials said . an unannounced federal inspection of __prodee__ 's main site in 2011 found only one english class with three students , though the school listed an enrollment of 900 students for its two sites , prosecutors said . on the same day , federal authorities also visited the american college of forensic studies found only one religion with one student , though the school claimed an enrollment of more than 300 foreign students , prosecutors said . some students transferred to one of the four schools after attending other u.s. schools also participating in the federal student and exchange visitor program , prosecutors said . the conspiracy count carries a maximum prison sentence of five years . the immigration fraud charges each carry up to 10 years in prison , and the money laundering charges carry a potential penalty of 20 years , authorities said . wednesday 's arrests follow last week 's federal raids of more than three dozen `` maternity hotels '' in southern california where foreign women give birth , allegedly for the sole purpose of having a __u.s.-citizen__ baby , authorities said . the `` maternity tourism '' sites included apartment complexes in los angeles , orange and san bernardino counties where authorities believe the businesses housed the foreign nationals about to give birth , federal officials said . those targeted residences are believed to have catered largely to women from china , who paid $ 15,000 to $ 50,000 for lodging , transportation and food , according to a statement by u.s. immigration and customs enforcement . those fees do n't necessarily include medical care , authorities said . specifically , authorities in the maternity tourism raids obtained search warrants for 37 location and conducted searches at more than 50 locations , including sites that consented to a federal search , said virginia __kice__ , a spokeswoman for u.s. immigration and customs enforcement .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- hillary clinton is back in the middle of an unfolding controversy . the revelation that as secretary of state she maintained a private email account , and that she had a private computer server in her new york home , sent shock waves through the world of politics last week . questions arose about whether clinton conducted her official business on private email , possibly violating regulations that were written to ensure that the activities of government officials remain accessible to the public . republicans jumped on the story . `` it makes you wonder , '' said reince __preibus__ , the chairman of the republican national committee . `` did she use the private emails so she could conduct diplomacy and fund-raising at the same time ? '' even many democrats are worried about the implications of this recent story . their front-runner , their `` inevitable '' nominee for 2016 , now seems vulnerable . many in washington are anticipating that the scandal is only getting started . this is not the first time that hillary clinton has found herself in this situation . she has spent much of her political career battling scandals . when her husband , bill clinton , was president of the united states , she was one of the first targets of the earliest investigations into the administration -- `` __travel-gate__ , '' `` __file-gate__ '' and the whitewater affair . she stood by her husband 's side later in his presidency when house republicans moved to impeach him for having lied about his sexual relationship with monica lewinsky , a white house intern . although clinton enjoyed a bit of a break when serving in the senate , the controversies resumed once she became secretary of state under president obama . during her tenure , republicans became consumed with multiple investigations into her role in the tragic benghazi attacks . although the investigations failed to find any evidence of wrongdoing , the issue became a rallying point for conservative activists and __fund-raisers__ . some republicans now claim that the emails will provide the data that they have been looking for to prove what they were saying . but those observers who are predicting her demise should remember that hillary clinton has proven to be remarkably resilient over the years . each time she or her family has been hit with a scandal , she has survived . she has proven to be an extraordinarily tough fighter who turns these challenges into opportunities to become stronger . as kate mckinnon , playing hillary clinton on `` saturday night live '' said , `` nice try . ... this is not how hillary clinton goes down . '' based on her history , what can we expect from the clinton scandal playbook ? attack the accuser and the investigative process : nobody has done this better than hillary clinton . when her husband first confronted charges about his affair , clinton famously went on television and spoke about a `` right-wing conspiracy '' that she claimed was driving the scandal . although the revelation that the affair did occur brought her family great embarrassment , her charge became part of a larger counterattack from the administration that proved to be extremely effective . the clintons zeroed in on the __hyperpartisanship__ of some members of the gop , such as house speaker newt gingrich , claiming that the republicans in congress were on a mission to pull off a political coup . she employed a similar strategy with the benghazi investigations , arguing that the inquiry was more a political tool used to rally the base than a serious investigation . we are likely to hear similar arguments now , particularly since the email controversy has opened up right as the campaign season is taking off . as more republicans ca n't resist jumping on the issue , clinton will push back , focusing public attention less on the issue than on the idea that this is part of a political narrative to bring her down . stick it out : one thing that hillary clinton and her husband understand well is that the news media love a good scandal feeding frenzy , but that soon enough reporters move on . the american public , which is now used to fast-paced and constantly changing news stories , will follow the coverage as it shifts to a new story even after weeks , or months , of attention on one single issue . remember the ebola crisis ? not many people do , though for a time it was all anyone was talking about . as brendan __nyhan__ wrote in the new york times : `` if there 's one thing we 've learned from past presidential campaigns , it 's that most supposed __game-changers__ like this quickly fade from the memory of the political class , having never been noticed by most americans in the first place . '' when dealing with scandal , hillary clinton and her husband have avoided taking any rash action , ignoring whispers about resignation or discussions about major apologies . instead they strike back against their opponents and wait out the news cycle until the frenzy dies down . people should not expect clinton to do anything drastic in the near future . her first move , via twitter , was to announce in straightforward fashion that she has asked the state department to review and release some of the email as soon as possible . while some democrats are __champing__ at the bit to use this opportunity to push other members of their party -lrb- elizabeth warren ! -rrb- into the political fray , clinton is not going to give them any space to do this . she will wait until reporters and congress move in a different direction . rally the party base : if there is one thing that the clintons understand , it is that their party is desperate for a good fight . after years of dealing with congressional republicans and the __hardball__ tactics of conservative activists , the clintons appreciate that members of their party are searching for leaders who will take on their opponents . democrats are tired of elected officials who roll over too easily when attacked by republicans . this has been one of the major complaints from democrats about obama . even when many democrats were furious with the white house following the monica lewinsky revelation , the clintons appealed to partisan instincts and rallied the troops to fight for them as a way to push back against the gop . by 1998 , they had transformed the issue from being about clinton and perjury to a struggle to protect the democratic party . clinton will do this again . democrats are feeling particularly vulnerable ever since former florida gov. jeb bush entered the race , bringing star power to a gop campaign that seemed filled with __lightweights__ and flawed candidates . given that democrats feel the stakes are enormously high to keep control of the white house so that the next president can protect obama 's programs from republican attack , clinton will appeal to that instinct to carry her through . will it work ? that remains to be seen . it will depend on the scale and scope of the upcoming revelations and what her opponents decide to do with the material . but the clinton playbook is pretty clear and __road-tested__ . if clinton 's critics and opponents expect her to just roll over , they really have n't been studying their history .

ARTICEL:     lausanne , switzerland -lrb- cnn -rrb- nuclear talks intensified sunday between world powers and iran , but key sticking points remained unresolved as the countries tried to reach a deal to curb tehran 's nuclear program ahead of a tuesday deadline . as the negotiations entered their fourth day , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu warned the agreement coming together is worse than israel 's deepest fears . the talks had hit a snag on saturday , with diplomats describing iran as refusing to budge , but as the french , german and chinese foreign ministers arrived , the mood seemed more optimistic . the british and russian foreign ministers were expected late sunday . u.s. officials and western diplomats described the negotiations as tough and intense , which was expected as the talks reached the endgame . they said the contours of a deal are becoming clearer , but they were unsure it could be reached . two core issues are still unresolved : 1 -rrb- limits on iranian research and development on advanced nuclear technology in the end years of the deal ; and 2 -rrb- the pace of lifting united nations sanctions . the u.s. officials stressed all of the elements were __interrelated__ and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to , comparing the final deal to a puzzle . but they indicated most of the other elements were __solvable__ if those two major hurdles could be overcome . the speed of which u.n. sanctions could be lifted remains in dispute . iran wants them lifted immediately after the deal goes into effect . while diplomats say iran could see unilateral sanctions relief in the areas of trade , oil and banking , sanctions adopted by the united nations are more complicated . many are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the u.n. nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , that iran 's nuclear program does not have a military dimension . on saturday , iranian foreign minister mohammad zarif made clear the issue of sanctions remains a stumbling block , saying he believes the world powers `` have realized that sanctions , pressure and an agreement will not go together . it 's only to translate that understanding and realization into the agreement that we are negotiating . '' u.s. officials said that all sides , including iran , agree that sanctions would be lifted in phases over time as iran confirms its compliance to the deal . but they acknowledge there is still disagreement on the actual formula . iran also wants the ability to continue to research and develop more advanced centrifuges while the deal is in effect . those machines can enrich uranium much faster than its current machines . u.s. and european officials worry that could enable iran to quickly produce enough uranium for a nuclear weapon . diplomats say the first 10 years of the 15 year deal would have the most stringent restrictions , with others being relaxed over the next five . `` we will see if they are ready to swallow what we proposed , '' a western diplomat said . `` we are not asking them to do nothing , but they want to do more than we want them to do '' referring to how much research the iranians want to be able to still undertake . but the diplomat added , `` after 15 years , they can do what they want . '' a senior iranian diplomat told cnn on sunday : `` it 's not fair to characterize the state of affairs as iranian resistance on those issues . it can also be characterized as the other side 's __intransigence__ in the talks . '' diplomats said iran has agreed to a cap of fewer than 6,000 centrifuges that it can operate to enrich uranium , a process that can lead to weapons-grade material . the figure is down from the 6,000 the sides were speaking about when the talks started on thursday , but substantially more than the several hundred the united states had originally wanted . iran currently runs about 10,000 centrifuges , but it has around 19,000 in its stockpile . u.s. officials maintain the number is abstract , because there will be other restrictions on the levels of enrichment and type of centrifuges iran can operate , which they believe will extend the time iran would need to have enough __fissile__ material produce a nuclear weapon -- known as the `` __break-out__ time '' -- to at least a year . on monday , a senior state department official said negotiators had not yet decided anything about the disposal of __fissile__ material . there had been word previously that iran might export it to russia , but an iranian negotiator , abbas __araqchi__ , told journalists sunday that iran had not agreed to it . `` the export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program , and we do not intend to them abroad . ... there is no question of sending the stocks abroad , '' he said . netanyahu voiced alarm at the emerging deal . after meeting with visiting senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , a republican , netanyahu said , `` this agreement as it evolves is fulfilling our deepest fears and even worse . '' `` in parallel to the gathering for this dangerous agreement , the proxies of iran in the middle east are carrying out a wide occupation of yemen , '' he said . `` the __iran-lausanne-yemen__ axis is very dangerous to mankind and needs to be stopped . '' the parties are seeking agreement on the basic parameters of a deal before march 31 . a comprehensive deal including technical __annexes__ is supposed to be concluded by june 30 . tuesday is seen as a critical milestone to the u.s. negotiators , who are trying to thwart a threat from congress to impose additional sanctions without the framework . that could prompt iran to withdraw from the talks and scuttle the chances of a deal altogether . but even if a pact is reached , it is unclear what form it would take . u.s. officials say they will need to publicize something that __quantifies__ iran 's commitments before submitting it to congress . but u.s. and western diplomats say that iran is looking simply for an `` understanding '' of what has been agreed to before a formal accord is reached . cnn 's jim sciutto contributed to this report .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     one key sticking point : what would be the limits on iranian nuclear research ? another sticking point : when would u.n. sanctions be lifted ? israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu warns the deal would be a disaster .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- iraqi forces say they 've captured key areas in their offensive to take back tikrit , which has been under isis control since june . the security forces , backed by shia militias , raised the iraqi flag over the __governorate__ and the main hospital buildings in the city monday night , a security official with the forces in tikrit told cnn . the gains , according to the official , came after a slow advance into the city as the forces dealt with more than 300 improvised explosive devices planted in the city 's streets . at least 26 militants were killed in the operation , the official said . earlier monday , iraqi federal police said in a statement aired on iraqi television that the forces had liberated four neighborhoods in southern tikrit . the renewed push into tikrit comes days after a series of u.s.-led airstrikes aimed at isis targets around the city . the goal of those airstrikes was to pave the way for iraqi forces to go in . now security forces and fighters from __hashd__ __al-shaabi__ , a predominantly shia paramilitary force that has doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take tikrit back from isis , say they 're gaining ground . iraqi forces have tried multiple times to win back tikrit since isis , which calls itself the islamic state , conquered the city in june as part of its campaign to amass an expansive islamic caliphate . and each time , so far , they 've failed . the latest push began after iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi on march 1 ordered iraqi forces to retake tikrit and __salahuddin__ province . militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city , which is the birthplace of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein and located about 160 kilometers -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- north of baghdad . isis responded by adjusting its positions in and around the city , hiding in buildings and other key infrastructure , said saad __al-hadithi__ , a spokesman for al-abadi . this movement led iraq 's military to pause its operation , out of growing worries that a full-on invasion could produce heavy iraqi military and some civilian casualties . the situation spurred the iraqi prime minister to request help from the u.s.-led coalition , which conducted airstrikes around tikrit last week . cnn 's jomana karadsheh , catherine e. shoichet , ashley fantz , ben wedeman and greg botelho contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- the hollywood reporter -rrb- good artists borrow . great artists steal . on tuesday , a california federal jury delivered its own message to artists everywhere that inspiration can rise to copyright infringement . the verdict was reached after eight days of trial testimony examining whether robin thicke 's and pharrell williams ' `` blurred lines , '' one of the most successful songs of the young century , was improperly drawn from a soulful hallmark from the prior one -- marvin gaye 's 1977 hit `` got to give it up . '' ultimately , a jury comprised of five women and three men heard dueling opinions regarding `` blurred lines '' and decided to order thicke and williams to pay $ 4 million in copyright damages plus profits attributable to infringement , which for thicke was determined to be $ 1.8 million and for williams was determined to be $ 1.6 million . both escaped statutory damages as the infringement was found not to be willful . read more : robin thicke sues to protect ` blurred lines ' from marvin gaye 's family -lrb- exclusive -rrb- . the hardly predictable outcome over a song that made more than $ 16 million in profits will resonate in the music industry where copyright lawsuits are commonplace , but few such suits ever make it to trial . most never get past the summary judgment phase because judges carefully draw the line on any lawsuits alleging __misappropriation__ of __non-protectable__ ideas . the highest profile disputes like the one between tom petty and sam smith over `` stay with me '' usually settle . not only did the `` blurred lines '' case go the distance , both sides brought esteemed entertainment __litigators__ to convince the jury . howard king , representing thicke , williams and rapper __t.i__ -lrb- a.k.a. clifford harris jr. -rrb- , spoke how artists need wide berth in their creative pursuits . during opening arguments , he told the jury , `` we 're going to show you what you already know : that no one owns a genre or a style or a groove . to be inspired by marvin gaye is an honorable thing . '' over the next __week-and-a-half__ , king would execute a __two-pronged__ strategy : first , he emphasized that frankie and __nona__ gaye only owned __compositional__ elements in the `` got to give it up '' sheet music , leaving out more recognizable elements of the recording like the percussion and singing . second , he had witnesses testifying both to the differences of `` blurred lines '' and `` got to give it up '' as well as the similarities in other famous songs . the case has been tough on thicke thanks to depositions revealing he lied in media interviews and was drunk and high on vicodin . but the singer attempted to do himself a favor by showcasing that songs can be stitched together with ease and that perceptions about similarity can be deceiving . on the witness stand , he sang a medley of u2 's `` with or without you , '' the beatles ' `` let it be , '' __alphaville__ 's `` forever young , '' bob marley 's `` no woman no cry '' and michael jackson 's `` man in the mirror . '' read more : robin thicke admits drug abuse , lying to media in wild `` blurred lines '' deposition -lrb- exclusive -rrb- . williams also testified about his song creation process , admitting to jurors that `` blurred lines '' channels `` that '70s feeling '' and that he looked up to gaye , but that to feel , is n't copyright infringement . `` the last thing you want to do as a creator is take something of someone else 's when you love him , '' said williams , expressing a __point-of-view__ that 's in contrast to the maxim that good artists borrow and great artists steal . richard busch , attorney for the __gayes__ , appeared to know he 'd need to overcome the celebrity charisma of his counterparts . `` they will smile at you and they will be charming , '' he said in opening arguments . `` keep one thing in mind : they are professional performers . '' read more : ` blurred lines ' trial -- robin thicke performs piano medley in court . the gaye family was handicapped by u.s. district judge john __kronstadt__ 's decision to preclude use at trial of the original sound recording of `` got to give it up '' because gaye 's __copyrights__ on the song were limited to the sheet music compositions . before the trial began , busch wondered whether his side would get a fair trial , and while the judge eventually allowed a __stripped-down__ version of gaye 's song to be played for the jury 's ears , the attorney was disturbed by comments made by the thicke side that he argued had `` poisoned '' the trial . the judge dismissed those concerns . any lingering unhappiness over the judge 's decision leading to the jury 's verdict will likely be taken on appeal . to demonstrate copyright infringement , busch instead leaned on the __musicologists__ , who testified of similarities in signature phrase , hook , __keyboard-bass__ interplay , lyrics and theme of the songs . although `` blurred lines '' was the headliner , the gaye family also attempted to prove that thicke 's `` love after war '' was an infringement of gaye 's `` after the dance '' too . then , there was the rare peek at `` blurred lines '' financial success as the gaye family made their case for damages . busch had accounting experts speak about all the money made -- including $ 5.6 million in profits to thicke , $ 5.2 million to williams and $ __700k__ to t.i. and the rest of the $ 16.7 million in overall profits to record companies __interscope__ , __umg__ distribution and star __trak__ . the __gayes__ also wanted some of the $ 11 million in touring income attributable to `` blurred lines '' success as well as money for overhead costs and statutory damages for willful infringement . all told , the gaye family was seeking more than $ 25 million -- a mammoth demand that would shatter the song plagiarism __high-water__ mark of $ 5.4 million that a california court ordered michael bolton and sony to pay two decades ago for infringing the __isley__ brothers ' `` love is a wonderful thing . '' in closing arguments , busch raised the issue of thicke 's credibility , telling jurors , '' `` what it boils down to is ` yes , we copied . yes , we took it . yes , we lied about it . yes , we changed our story every time ' ... it boils down to this : who do you believe ? ... are you going to believe robin thicke , who told us all he 's not an honest person ? '' king offered a rebuttal . `` why would mr. williams need to copy anyone to create a hit ? '' he asked the jury . `` why would mr. thicke and mr. williams endure a proceeding like this , where their personal financial details are revealed to the world ? '' in what might now be the landmark legal controversy over __songcraft__ , the jury decided to find that thicke and williams infringed both songs . the two were only punished $ __9,375__ for `` love after war , '' but it will be the multimillion dollar verdict regarding `` blurred lines '' that will sound out for ages . © 2015 the hollywood reporter . all rights reserved .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- as relatives and friends mourn the loss of their loved ones aboard __germanwings__ flight __9525__ , the world community is stunned by the sequence of events that led to co-pilot andreas __lubitz__ purposely crashing the plane into the french alps , killing all 150 people on board . i happen to have several personal connections to this tragedy : a recent graduate of drexel university -- where i teach -- and her mother were on the ill-fated flight , i lived in germany for 18 years and i am a psychologist who has researched the psychology of terrorism and developed psychiatric tests that are used to determine pilot flight fitness . while the engineering of the airbus aircraft is fascinating and the world of air traffic control absorbing , what is even more complex and challenging to understand is the human mind of the co-pilot investigators say is responsible for the crash -- the machine that flies the machine . when complex engineering systems interact with human factors , it is most often the human that causes the anomaly . humans are far less reliable than machines . the average aviator has superior intellectual and cognitive abilities , and is psychologically stable and reliable . while it is not surprising that when it comes to aviation accidents , the first line of inquiry is into what went wrong with the plane . however , very often , as apparently is the case here , something went wrong with the human flying the plane . pilots are typically tested for emotional stability and screened for the presence of mental illness when they are selected . the u.s. navy has strict testing programs related to fitness for duty protocols for their pilots during the length of their careers . but we have learned that the german company lufthansa and its budget airline affiliate __germanwings__ do not use psychological testing once the pilots have made it through the selection process . psychological assessment and screening is not held in as high esteem in germany as it is in the united states . perhaps it should be . a __fitness-for-duty__ evaluation asks this important question : can the pilot safely and effectively perform his job from a mental health and cognitive standpoint ? the deliberate destruction of flight __9525__ by a single person , most likely related to some grievance or other unknown intrinsic motivation that he took to the grave , can also be considered an act of terrorism . the action constitutes the unlawful use of violence against the passengers on the flight to further some yet unknown objective . research on the perpetrators of terrorism has revealed that a single person is capable of executing odd , __unexplainable__ violent actions . their behaviors may be related to a political or social framework , or it may be associated with something deeply personal . examples include richard reid , the failed shoe bomber ; eric rudolph , the olympic bomber ; or theodore kaczynski , the __unabomber__ . in 2009 , maj. nidal malik hasan , a u.s. army officer and psychiatrist , went on a shooting spree at fort hood , texas , killing 13 and wounding 32 . and in 2012 , staff sgt. robert bales , a 38-year-old father of two , opened fire and killed 16 innocent afghan civilians . when examining __germanwings__ flight __9525__ from the `` cockpit of the human mind , '' one must ask this question : how can we ever predict or prevent tragedies like these when we can never truly know what lurks in the mind of another human being ? as a psychologist , i would , of course , advocate for more rigorous psychological screening and regular testing for pilots , as well as instituting additional security measures to prevent future incidents like this . just as aircraft are inspected and maintained , it is important to regularly evaluate one of the more fragile components of modern aviation -- the pilots operating the plane . but , just as the overwhelming majority of automobile accidents are caused by driver error , with a human mind at the helm of an aircraft , there will always be an element of unpredictability present . and , unless we had a `` flight recorder '' for the human brain , we will never really know what took place inside the mind of co-pilot andreas __lubitz__ . one thing is for sure : the tragic events of flight __9525__ will surely renew conversation about what happened to flight mh370 -- the biggest aviation mystery since amelia earhart vanished in 1937 -- and the role that human factors may have played in its disappearance .

ARTICEL:     beijing -lrb- cnn -rrb- five years ago , __beijinger__ robert zhao went on a trip to tibet . what he encountered left him confused but intrigued . a science graduate from china 's elite __tsinghua__ university , he had been taught to mistrust superstition and religion , but in the culture and devotion of the buddhists he met he found something worth knowing . now 25 , he is considering giving up his job and becoming a monk . `` it means i will have to give up everything of the ordinary world , '' he told cnn . while buddhism has a long history in china , entering via missionaries from india during the han dynasty , it was repressed during the maoist era -- many monasteries and temples were destroyed during the cultural revolution and monks actively punished for believing in `` superstition . '' but now , a growing number of chinese are __rediscovering__ the country 's dormant buddhist traditions . some , like zhao , are looking for a spiritual anchor in a competitive , __fast-changing__ society . others take comfort in meditation and enjoy volunteering . however , it 's not always easy to combine buddhist beliefs with the demands of modern life . zhao works as an assistant to the boss of an environmental company . his religion means it 's difficult to entertain clients and partners -- a key part of the role . `` not drinking , smoking or eating meat affects my socializing . so the company has to send someone else to go with me , which creates extra expenses , '' he says . zhao has not told his family about his desire to become a monk yet , fearing that they might oppose it . __fenggang__ yang , the director of the center on religion and chinese society at purdue university , indiana , says it 's difficult to explain exactly why so many young people are turning to buddhism . some discover it at university , where buddhist groups are active and famous monks and __lamas__ give lectures . others have devout parents and grandparents . he also says that the chinese communist party policy has `` moved toward treating buddhism more favorably than other religions . '' christianity has also been growing in popularity in recent decades but church leaders say there has been a crackdown on christians , with authorities demolishing churches and removing crosses from __skylines__ . in particular , it 's the tibetan strain of buddhism , rather than the chan -lrb- also called zen -rrb- tradition once popular in china , that is attracting new converts , particularly students , young professionals and __businesspeople__ , he says . `` it appears that both the chanting and the physical , spiritual practices of tibetan buddhism are appealing to some people , '' yang added . to what extent these new converts are committed to buddhism as a religion , with its __strictures__ and rituals , is an open question . a former leader of a university buddhism group , who did n't want to give his name , told cnn he thought its members were more interested in the religion as a lifestyle choice . activities that his group organized focusing on relaxation and stress relief were always more popular than reading groups and lectures that examined buddhist scriptures , he added . yang at purdue university says that for most people in china , buddhism is treated more as culture than a religion . they may visit temples or read buddhist books , but few people treat it as a religion that requires serious commitment . `` indeed , people who identify as buddhists do a lot of __non-buddhist__ spiritual things , such as believing in feng shui , consulting __fortune-tellers__ , practicing qi gong and sampling books and practices of other religions , '' he says . on a recent weekend , more than four hundred people attended the annual gathering of beijing ren ai foundation , a buddhist charitable organization , at __longquan__ monastery on the mountainous outskirts of the capital . __zhong__ ying , the group 's 32-year-old deputy secretary general , said the group 's most active volunteers were between 20 and 35 years old . in the past five years their numbers had doubled to 200 . for attendee __geng__ __hui'er__ , a 26-year-old who works and lives in beijing , buddhism was something she rediscovered after returning from studying abroad in england . growing up , her family had raised her buddhist although she says she never really `` felt it . '' she now regularly attends meditation activities in monasteries or study groups organized by volunteers . __geng__ says buddhism has given her a fresh outlook on life and past difficulties . it 's also helped her establish a network of people she can talk to and socialize with . `` we sit together , sharing things that have happened in our lives and how we dealt with them , which is more helpful than reading books '' , she says . for zhao , the aspiring monk , buddhism has been a balm while dealing with poor health , as well as work and relationship problems . `` my life has been tough for years . -lrb- buddhism -rrb- keeps me away from the negative thoughts , like a reminder that 's always there , which has helped me a lot .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the first official visit of afghan president ashraf ghani to washington comes as excitement mounts over the possibility that direct peace negotiations between the afghan government and the taliban are imminent . the visit , which began sunday , offers the opportunity for discussion and progress on a number of fronts , the coming face-to-face talks with the taliban almost certainly among them . but while the start of such talks would certainly be a positive development , it would hardly be a sign that peace is about to descend upon a land ravaged by decades of war . the reality is that an agreement with the taliban that is good for the afghan government is probably impossible right now . negotiations to end the taliban insurgency face a series of significant challenges , and an imperfect deal could harm afghanistan 's nascent unity government , encourage the formation of splinter groups of hardened fighters , boost existing terrorist groups like al qaeda and isis and plunge the country into an era of renewed violence and instability . that said , the united states should remain broadly supportive of these talks by promoting conditions that could make the possibility of success more likely down the road -- history has shown that successful negotiations most often occur when each party has some vulnerability to the other . militarily , the taliban is not the afghan government 's equal , but that does not mean the insurgents lack a strong negotiating position . for a start , the international presence in afghanistan is declining , freeing the taliban to operate more openly in the rural corners of the country . meanwhile , afghan security forces are being killed at rates that are probably not sustainable and civilian casualties are at an all-time high . most __troublingly__ , the new national unity government has yet to clearly demonstrate its ability to govern . all this means that until the new government shows that the diverse interests within it can coexist , and it __articulates__ a cohesive strategy to counter the taliban , the insurgents can make a strong case for postponing peace in the hopes of a better situation in the future . a second key to negotiating a path toward peace in afghanistan is devising a strategy to contain splinter groups . often in the course of negotiations , those unsatisfied with the peace process flock to new organizations to continue the fight . these can include so-called `` bitter __enders__ , '' hardened fighters who want no part of peace . the emergence of splinter groups is an expected part of any peace negotiation process , but it must be minimized for an agreement to take hold . in the case of afghanistan , there is no shortage of groups willing to absorb fighters , from outlaw bandit groups to al qaeda . recently , as ghani has highlighted , there have even been stories of fighters declaring allegiance to terrorist group isis . it goes without saying that the spread of isis 's particularly violent form of extremism within afghanistan would make an already complex and precarious security situation all the more so . finally , negotiations must happen at a time when a peace agreement can reasonably be enforced -- it is one thing to craft a compromise and quite another to carry it out . too often in peace negotiations , an agreement is viewed as a finish line , but any deal can easily be derailed by unpopular political accommodations , economic incentives and rebel fighters who refuse to drop their arms . to take hold , peace agreements require a legitimate and effective government capable of communicating new realities to the public and executing policies that are often __untried__ and complex . at the moment , the afghan government is struggling to carry out existing policies , while juggling the country 's many divergent interests . while a peace agreement would certainly boost the legitimacy of a national unity government , a stillborn accord would only lead to disillusionment and doubt . ultimately , the chances that talks between the afghan government and the taliban will succeed are remote at best . yet the united states should do everything it can to help create the underlying conditions to support productive negotiations -- if not now , at some point in the future . what can the u.s. do ? two things : . first , the obama administration could agree to the afghan government 's request to slow american troop withdrawals . this would allow the united states to assist the afghan government to stabilize the country and contain any __splintering__ anti-government factions . second , the u.s. could remain actively engaged in promoting the success of the afghan national unity government . this means not merely maintaining existing development and economic efforts , but finding opportunities to assist the new government to boost its legitimacy . for example , the united states could support emerging efforts to build a meaningful relationship between afghanistan and its neighbor pakistan , which would increase public confidence in the government 's ability to protect its people . it also could lend a hand advising political leaders , including the many first-time cabinet officials , on governance and public service . sowing the seeds of future success in bringing peace to afghanistan requires no new u.s. boots on the ground or extravagant financial commitments . rather , it takes a willingness to continue to engage with afghanistan 's dynamic set of political challenges in small , but meaningful ways .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- a nuclear deal with international powers on iran 's nuclear program is within reach and achievable , iranian president hassan rouhani told reporters saturday . rouhani said negotiators from both sides have found new common ground in recent days , the official islamic republic news agency reported . the president believes that `` clinching a general deal is easy , '' according to the irna story , but hammering out agreements on certain details `` will be a very tough and complicated job . '' iran has been largely isolated for years for its nuclear program , one that its leaders say the country wants for peaceful purposes . others , like the united states , have challenged that assertion and instituted strict sanctions , fearing that tehran actually plans to develop nuclear weapons . after years of basic __stalemates__ , iranian officials and representatives of the p5 +1 have managed to reach short-term agreements as they try to strike a larger deal . the sides have been working toward that end in lausanne , switzerland , hoping to get a framework pact in place ahead of a march 31 deadline . u.s. secretary of state john kerry and iranian foreign minister javad zarif , joined these talks monday . all sides took a break friday , but are expected to return to the negotiating table soon . kerry , addressing reporters saturday in lausanne before leaving for london , said `` substantial progress '' had been made toward reaching a deal but that `` important gaps remain . '' he insisted that the international powers involved in the talks , the p5 +1 -- consisting of germany and the five permanent members of the u.n. security council : the united states , russia , china , france and britain -- were united in their determination to ensure that iran 's nuclear program is purely peaceful . the stakes are high and the issues complicated , kerry said . `` let me once again be clear : we do n't want just any deal , '' he said . `` if we had , we could have announced something a long time ago . '' there has been `` genuine progress '' over the past 16 months since a joint plan was agreed and in his conversations with zarif of the past few days , kerry said . the international powers wo n't rush the process , he said , but the negotiations are at a decisive point . `` we recognize that fundamental decisions have to be made now and they do n't get any easier as time goes by , '' he said . `` it is time to make hard decisions . we want the right deal that would make the world , including the united states and our closest partners and allies , safer and more secure , and that is our test . '' u.s. president barack obama has made clear that he wants to achieve a `` comprehensive and durable agreement '' that is based on intensive verification of its implementation rather than trust , kerry added . `` we have not yet reached the finish line but , make no mistake , we have the opportunity to get this right , '' he said . while in london , kerry met with his counterparts from the uk , germany and france , as well as the european union foreign policy chief , to discuss their coordinated approach . british foreign minister philip hammond spoke for the group , echoing kerry but saying while `` substantial progress has been made in some areas , '' there were other areas that lacked agreement . `` the time has come now for iran in particular to make some very tough decisions if we are going to see progress made , '' hammond said . kerry also spoke friday by phone with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov and chinese foreign minister wang yi . the iranian president 's guarded optimism saturday -- which also happens to be __nowruz__ , a holiday marking the start of spring and beginning of a new year in the persian calendar -- jibes with the progress cited recently by the iranians ' counterparts in the talks . western officials said friday that the ongoing negotiations have led to compromises on some crucial issues that have long divided the west and iran . specifically , the parties are __coalescing__ around an idea that iran could keep 6,000 centrifuges in any deal , down from the 6,500 that had been under discussion , two western diplomats told cnn . the pace of relief from sanctions is a sticking point for iran , according to a western official . iranian negotiators want them lifted immediately , while u.s. and european negotiators prefer they be phased out over several years , contingent on iran meeting its end of the bargain . the debate has generated heated disagreements not only in switzerland , but also in washington , where israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu spoke to congress on march 3 at the invitation of republican leaders to warn about any nuclear deal with iran . the speech was made without the approval of u.s. president barack obama . the next week , an open letter signed by 47 republican senators , addressing iran 's leadership , noted that any agreement made with the u.s. administration that is not approved by the senate could be __nullified__ by obama 's successor . late thursday , obama reached out `` directly to the people and leaders of iran , '' in a video message recorded ostensibly for __nowruz__ , to urge them to back a deal curtailing tehran 's nuclear program . `` this year we have the best opportunity in decades to pursue a different future between our countries , '' obama said . '' ... together we have to speak up for the future we seek ... i believe our countries should be able to resolve this issue peacefully with diplomacy . '' but iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , in his own __nowruz__ address on saturday , noted the political divisions within the united states over the nuclear talks , iran 's state-run press tv reported . he suggested the u.s. president 's __nowruz__ message `` included dishonest assertions and his claim of friendship for iranian people was not sincere , '' he is quoted as saying . khamenei also said obama had claimed falsely that some people in iran did not back a diplomatic resolution to the nuclear issue . what they are in fact resisting is the bullying approach of the united states , he said , according to press tv . the ayatollah also insisted that the removal of sanctions should be part of the negotiations , not a step that only followed the implementation of a deal . `` iran will never accept this , '' he said . `` this is the americans ' ploy . removal of sanctions should be part of any agreement . '' cnn 's laura koran , elise labott and hamdi alkhshali contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- new zealand are on course for a first ever world cup title after a thrilling semifinal victory over south africa , secured off the penultimate ball of the match . chasing an adjusted target of 298 in just 43 overs after a rain interrupted the match at eden park , grant elliott hit a six right at the death to confirm victory and send the auckland crowd into __raptures__ . it is the first time new zealand has ever reached a world cup final , and it will play either australia or india on sunday . te pair face each other in sydney on thursday . not the first time in the sport , rain played a part . south africa were motoring with the bat before a two-hour delay for poor weather . though its total was escalated by the __duckworth/lewis__ method -- used to calculate a revised target in the event of a rain delay -- new zealand held firm thanks to elliott . his 84 not out underpinned its innings and it was fitting that he delivered the final blow , smashing dale steyn for six off the second last ball to spark jubilant scenes at eden park . `` i do n't think this win is for myself or the team , but everyone here , '' elliott said at the post-match presentation . `` the supporters have been amazing . `` i think we timed the pace of the innings to perfection . i was n't as calm as i looked . when you have 45,000 fans screaming at you every ball ... `` it has been an absolute pleasure playing in front of this crowd . we have had a good run . it is the first final we have been in as new zealand . `` we are a very level team , we will approach it as any other game . nothing going in my mind when i hit the six . i do n't even know where the ball went . '' south africa , who themselves have never reached the final , have been accused of choking in past installments of the one-day competition . but that indictment can not be leveled at it after one of the most dramatic matches in world cup history . it had recovered from __114-3__ in the 27th over to __216-3__ after 38 overs thanks to some fierce hitting from captain ab de villiers and __faf__ du plessis , before the rain came . with the game stopped for two hours , it finally reached 281 off its reduced 43 overs , du plessis top scoring with 82 . new zealand 's target was upgraded via __duckworth/lewis__ , a calculation that takes into account how many overs were left and how many wickets had been lost , to 298 . kiwi skipper brendan mccullum got it off to a fast start with a __22-ball__ half-century but after he was dismissed it wobbled , and needed 139 from 22 overs . but elliott was the __steadying__ hand , judging his innings perfectly . and though he was dropped in the penultimate over , he struck the telling blow off steyn to seal victory and inflict a fourth semifinal defeat on south africa . `` it was a great advertisement for cricket , '' mccullum said at the post-match presentation . `` everybody involved will remember this for the rest of their lives . `` what a great innings from grant . he came out of wilderness not long ago . the greatest time of our lives . we have enjoyed the experience . `` i hope the crowds are all dreaming the way we are . gee it would be nice to win it . we do n't mind whom we face in the final . `` they are both quality sides , but we know if we play the way we want to we are a good chance .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the iran nuclear negotiations in lausanne , switzerland , reportedly have made substantive progress , inching closer toward a provisional agreement between the p5 +1 and iran . while the talks continued to unfold this week , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu __restated__ his concern about an agreement with iran , vowing `` to continue to act against any threat . '' if an agreement is reached , the international spotlight will turn to israel , in anticipation of its possible reaction . israeli defense minister moshe `` __bogy__ '' __yaalon__ stated that a deal is `` a tragedy for the whole world . '' the question is , however , what can israel really do once a deal is signed ? in recent days , notable conservatives in the united states have attacked president barack obama 's handling of the negotiations with iran , arguing that a bad deal will force israel 's hand , leaving it with no choice but to attack iranian targets . but is this a realistic conclusion ? israel 's stated `` all options are on the table '' policy toward iran has been in place for years and is based on the assumption that if a diplomatic solution to the nuclear problem can not be reached or is not to its liking , israel can decide to opt for a military strike on iran 's nuclear facilities . __thirty-four__ years after the successful israeli bombing of the __osirak__ nuclear facility in iraq , military experts have little doubt that the israeli air force today is capable of reaching iranian airspace and bombing targets above and below ground . therefore , the question is not one of military capability but more about domestic political and geopolitical strategy . with an iran deal in place , the israeli leadership may face stern objections from the heads of the israeli defense establishment , which will make it difficult but not impossible to take such a decision . nevertheless , if it remains keen on pursuing a military option , the israeli leadership will have to consider the following set of consequences that will likely result from such a decision : . • a successful military strike on iranian installations may degrade iran 's nuclear program , setting it back several years , but it would not completely eliminate iran 's nuclear capabilities . iran would likely be able to resume activity in new facilities soon after such an attack , with more international legitimacy to embark on a military nuclear program , in the face of future military challenges to its sovereignty and stability . a deal between the p5 +1 -lrb- the united states , china , france , russia , united kingdom and germany -rrb- and iran is expected to include a 10-year -lrb- or more -rrb- `` sunset provision '' that is much longer than the period it will take iran to get its program back on track in case of an israeli attack . • a military attack against iran after a deal is signed would put israel on a collision course with the p5 + 1 , who were negotiating the contours of a deal with iran , as well as with other members of the international community . bilateral ties and cooperation with member states of the p5 +1 may suffer , as well as intelligence sharing between the relevant intelligence agencies . in addition , countries are likely to seek ways to `` punish '' israel for its actions , in the form of a u.n. general assembly or security council resolution condemning israeli behavior , calling for operative measures against the jewish state . • an israeli attack would likely lead to the collapse of the international sanctions regime on iran , which israel has worked to consolidate and which has been a very effective mechanism in pressuring iran . • the understanding between israel and moderate arab regimes on the need to prevent a nuclear iran would not be likely to dissipate in the aftermath of an attack , but __israeli-arab__ coordination and cooperation on this issue is bound to suffer . • finally , an israeli attack would spark a direct iranian military reaction against israel , as well as an indirect reaction against israel in the region by iran 's proxies hezbollah -lrb- from southern lebanon and war-torn syria -rrb- and hamas -lrb- from gaza and perhaps the west bank -rrb- and against israeli targets abroad . in the aftermath of a deal with iran , israel 's response is expected to be harsh . it will include strong public criticism of the deal , a vow to continue the fight against the agreement in the u.s. congress and other relevant venues , a call for the international community to continue the sanctions regime , and a pursuit of coordinated public messaging with moderate arab regimes on this issue . these israeli public diplomacy measures will be complemented by continued intelligence monitoring of iran 's activities in the nuclear sphere as well as its involvement in regional conflicts . opting for a military strike against iran , however , must take into consideration the consequences of such a decision . in light of all that is at stake , it does not seem like a plausible option at present .

'' previously , airstrikes hit houthi militant groups , smashed their air defense guns and crumbled key infrastructure , a saudi official has said . egyptian warships fired on the road that runs from the yemeni port town of __zinjibar__ into the key coastal city of aden but did not fire on aden directly , according to an official with yemen 's southern movement . the road is the eastern approach to aden and is one of the three main roads into the city . the egyptian naval barrage is intended to block the houthi advance on aden and push those fighters back , the source said . egyptian warships had deployed to the bab __al-mandab__ strait last friday , according to media reports , intent on protecting that passage that is the only access from the arabian sea to egypt 's suez canal . the coalition 's campaign has been dubbed operation __al-hazm__ storm . the arabic term `` __al-hazm__ '' can be translated as `` __determinant__ '' or `` decisive . '' saudi arabia and egypt have both talked about the possibility of putting boots on the ground . on saturday , yemeni foreign minister riyadh yaseen said he expected coalition troops to be in yemen within days . saudi leaders have said that if troops do go in , they wo n't leave until they have degraded the houthis ' ability to fight . the houthis are apt guerrillas . a fight on the ground could prove bloody and lengthy . the conflict splits the region along religious lines . operation decisive storm 's largely sunni coalition includes saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , kuwait , bahrain , qatar , jordan , morocco , egypt and sudan . on monday , pakistan 's government said prime minister nawaz sharif had chaired `` a high-level meeting '' of senior officials to review the situation in the middle east . `` the meeting concluded that pakistan remains firmly committed to supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of saudi arabia in accordance with the aspirations of the people of pakistan , '' it said in a statement . `` it was emphasized that pakistan stands committed to playing a meaningful role in arresting the deteriorating situation in the middle east . in the same context , and to facilitate early resolution of the crisis and to promote peace and unity of the muslim __ummah__ -lrb- community -rrb- , the prime minister would be contacting the leadership of brotherly countries , '' the statement continued . the shiite houthis are allied with iran , a majority shiite nation . saudi arabia has accused iran of boosting the houthis ' weaponry for their offensive . iran has sharply denounced the __saudi-dominated__ intervention in yemen . on sunday , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu accused iran of trying to use the conflict in yemen to `` take over the whole middle east . '' the united states has supported the coalition 's efforts . while it is helping the __saudi-led__ team with logistics and locating targets , the u.s. is not participating in active battle . dozens have died in the airstrikes , houthi commanders said . the rebel commanders also said the coalition struck the __houthi-controlled__ al __anad__ air base , which was used as the headquarters for u.s. counterterrorism operations before houthi rebels took control of it . the houthis claimed they shot down a sudanese jet and captured the pilot on saturday . they distributed photos of a pilot and wreckage to back up the claim . the yemeni crisis erupted when shiite houthi rebels , who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country , began seizing the capital and other parts of the country last fall . houthis moved into sanaa in september , sparking battles that killed hundreds of people . yemeni president abdu __rabu__ mansour hadi fled the capital over a month ago . in january , houthis surrounded the presidential palace . hadi resigned and was put under house arrest . he escaped in february and went to the coastal city of aden , but declared he was still the country 's leader . last week , hadi went to sharm el-sheikh , egypt , to attend the arab league summit , where he is rallying support for operation decisive storm . even from afar , hadi had strong words for the houthis : . `` you violated the sovereignty -lrb- of yemen -rrb- , '' he said , `` and you bear the responsibility for what happened and what is going to happen . '' that arab league summit produced a notable agreement : the sharm el-sheikh declaration , which paves the way for a united arab force that would be ready to fight insurgents if a member country came under attack . egyptian president abdel fattah el-sisi actually called for a joint arab force last month to fight isis . but the agreement over the weekend carries extra significance amid the battle against houthis in yemen . egypt : it 's time for an arab coalition against isis . the logistics and details of the joint arab force have yet to be worked out . but the declaration also urges the houthis to immediately withdraw from yemen 's government institutions and to surrender their arms to `` legitimate authorities . '' many u.n. representatives have had to flee the chaos . and saudi naval special forces have rescued dozens of diplomats , a saudi official said . the conflict in yemen also led to the withdrawal of u.s. special forces earlier this month , seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts in a country that has been a stronghold for al qaeda in the arabian peninsula . __haass__ , of the council on foreign relations , said what 's happening in yemen could devolve into a long , protracted religious war . `` you have civil wars , you have proxy wars . you have regional wars all in one , '' he said . `` and these things have so many logs on the fire , to use the metaphor , that they ... burn and burn and burn for a long time .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- swedish prosecutors have asked julian assange 's legal representatives whether the wikileaks founder would consent to be interviewed in london and have his dna taken via a swab . assange has been holed up in the ecuadorian embassy in london since june 2012 to avoid extradition to sweden , where prosecutors want to question him about 2010 allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another . swedish prosecutors have previously balked at coming to britain to question assange . however , a number of the crimes julian assange is suspected of will be subject to a statute of limitation in august 2015 , according to a statement from marianne ny , the director of public prosecutions . `` if assange gives his consent , the prosecutor will promptly submit a request for legal assistance to the british authorities to further continue the investigation , '' the statement said . a request will also be made to the ecuadorian authorities for permission to `` perform investigative measures '' at its london embassy , the statement said . ecuador granted assange political asylum in 2012 . assange 's defense lawyer , per e. __samuelsson__ , said he called assange on friday morning with the news from the prosecution authority -- and that in principle they viewed the request positively . `` i think i woke him up , but he knew i was calling with news about the case since i called so early , '' __samuelsson__ said . `` he was , of course , very happy that something is finally happening but he is irritated that it has taken such a long time . '' this is a step that assange and his team have been requesting for four years , __samuelsson__ said . ny explained the logic behind the swedish authorities ' change of approach in her statement . `` my view has always been that to perform an interview with him at the ecuadorian embassy in london would lower the quality of the interview , and that he would need to be present in sweden in any case should there be a trial in the future , '' ny said . `` this assessment remains unchanged . now that time is of the essence , i have viewed it therefore necessary to accept such deficiencies to the investigation and likewise take the risk that the interview does not move the case forward , particularly as there are no other measures on offer without assange being present in sweden . '' the australian national has not been charged and denies the claims . he 's said he fears sweden would extradite him to the united states , where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through wikileaks . __samuelsson__ said assange 's legal team would travel over to london as soon as possible to discuss ny 's request and that it expects to respond next week . `` the problem is that there are two more countries involved in this request so it might take some time to make all this happen , '' __samuelsson__ said . __samuelsson__ also said friday 's development was not a great surprise since sweden 's supreme court had last week asked the prosecutor general for an opinion on the case . `` we think that the prosecutor general , who has taken over the case , probably told prosecutor ny to interview assange in london , '' he said . assange has previously said the arrest warrant should be thrown out because , in part , swedish authorities declined to interview him at the ecuadorian embassy , thereby prolonging a preliminary investigation that he said should have concluded long ago . london 's metropolitan police said last month that the cost of the operation to guard the embassy to prevent assange fleeing had spiraled to more than 10 million pounds -lrb- $ 15.3 million . -rrb- overall . cnn 's claudia __rebaza__ contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- if you were the lucky recipient of a bunch of fragrant roses this valentine 's day , it 's likely that they came from kenya . the country is the third largest exporter of cut flowers in the world , accounting for around 35 % of all sales in the european union . famed for being long-lasting , kenya 's roses , __carnations__ and summer flowers are also popular in russia and the u.s. where last week several growers showcased their blooms at the world floral expo in los angeles . the event is one of the industry 's largest and gathers over 80 exhibitors from across the world , with several ethiopian growers also representing the african continent alongside kenya . the country 's flower power is attributed to its sunny climate , which enables high-quality blossoms to be grown year-round without the need for __expensive-to-run__ greenhouses . kenya also has excellent transport links to europe , and from there , the rest of the world through nairobi airport , which has a terminal dedicated specially to the transport of flowers and vegetables . this means that delicate floral cargo which is __perishable__ in nature can be shifted from growers to consumers swiftly . more than 500,000 people in the country depend on the trade according to the kenya flower council , with roughly half of the country 's 127 flower farms concentrated around lake __naivasha__ , around 90 kilometers northwest of nairobi . `` __naivasha__ is a big center because it 's a freshwater lake and it is not very far from nairobi , which makes transport easy , '' says john __kihia__ , technical director of __floralife__ africa , a company which provides hydration , transport and storage for the __cut-flower__ industry . `` people have been growing flowers there for a long time so there is a skilled labor force in place , '' he adds . activists have expressed concerns over the environmental impact that the booming trade could inflict on the lake , but local farmers have been working with the wwf in order to make sure that water levels are not affected : `` it 's about putting together a strong business case about why it 's good for growers to save water and ways to manage that , '' says drew mcvey , wwf technical adviser who calls the collaboration `` a story of success . '' __naivasha__ lake 's location __1,884__ meters above sea level is particularly fertile ground for medium-sized roses which are often found in the floral sections of eu supermarkets , whereas farms in higher altitudes yield bigger blooms popular in russia : `` it 's a consumer preference . in moscow people will buy a single rose , so if it 's bigger it naturally looks more spectacular , whereas in the uk they buy bunches more often , '' says __kihia__ . big business . horticulture has been one of the top foreign exchange earners for kenya , and the flower industry alone raked in around $ 600m last year , exporting __124,858__ tonnes valued at around $ __507m__ in 2013 . nearly two thirds of exports are destined for holland , where they are resold to __florists__ through auctions which present a safe avenue into the market for less seasoned growers : `` if you sell through an auction and you have a good quality product , people will be competing for your flowers which will give you a better price , '' __kihia__ says . while europe remains the biggest destination for kenyan flowers due to its relative geographic proximity and good transport links , this has left producers vulnerable to turmoil on the continent , such as the recent recession . `` it has had an impact on the sector and we have experienced a slowdown in demand , which slows down business , '' says jane __ngige__ , ceo of the kenyan flower council . kenyan exports also suffered when in october of last year the eu imposed import taxes on cut flowers from the country , but the levy was lifted on christmas day allowing kenyan producers to storm valentine 's day sales . jane __ngige__ says that the industry is now exploring other markets such as australia , canada and japan , and adds that direct flights from nairobi airport play a crucial role in helping the kenyan flower business take off globally : `` a direct flight to the destination is key owing to the fact that this is fresh produce and it needs to get to the end user quickly in order to guarantee quality . it also makes it less expensive , '' she says . kenyan growers are now lending their floral expertise to neighboring rwanda by partnering with the country 's government to create a 35 hectare flower park 60 kilometers from rwanda 's capital kigali . it 's hoped that the park will eventually produce three million stems per year and kick-start rwanda 's __floriculture__ sector , which could pump more than $ 200 million into the country 's economy by 2017 . editor 's note : each week , africa view explores the trends , figures and initiatives shaping africa . from education and energy to technology and innovation , it showcases topics and influential sectors driving countries on the continent .

ARTICEL:     london -lrb- cnn -rrb- it might sound like a really old wives ' tale , but a __thousand-year-old__ anglo-saxon potion for eye infections may hold the key to wiping out the modern-day superbug mrsa , according to new research . the __10th-century__ `` __eyesalve__ '' remedy was discovered at the british library in a __leather-bound__ volume of bald 's __leechbook__ , widely considered to be one of the earliest known medical textbooks . christina lee , an expert on anglo-saxon society from the school of english at the university of nottingham , translated the ancient manuscript despite some __ambiguities__ in the text . `` we chose this recipe in bald 's __leechbook__ because it contains ingredients such as garlic that are currently investigated by other researchers on their potential antibiotic effectiveness , '' lee said in a video posted on the university 's website . `` and so we looked at a recipe that is fairly straightforward . it 's also a recipe where we are told it 's the ` best of __leechdoms__ ' -- how could you not test that ? so we were curious . '' lee enlisted the help of the university 's __microbiologists__ to see if the remedy actually worked . the recipe calls for two species of __allium__ -lrb- garlic and onion or leek -rrb- , wine and __oxgall__ -lrb- bile from a cow 's stomach -rrb- to be brewed in a brass vessel . `` we recreated the recipe as faithfully as we could . the bald gives very precise instructions for the ratio of different ingredients and for the way they should be combined before use , so we tried to follow that as closely as possible , '' said microbiologist freya harrison , who led the work in the lab at the school of life sciences . the book included an instruction for the recipe to be left to stand for nine days before being strained through a cloth . efforts to replicate the recipe exactly included finding wine from a vineyard known to have existed in the ninth century , according to steve __diggle__ , an associate professor of __sociomicrobiology__ , who also worked on the project . the researchers then tested their recipe on cultures of mrsa , __methicillin-resistant__ staphylococcus __aureus__ , a type of staph bacterium that does not respond to commonly used antibiotic treatments . the scientists were n't holding out much hope that it would work -- but they were astonished by the lab results . `` what we found was very interesting -- we found that bald 's __eyesalve__ is incredibly potent as an __anti-staphylococcal__ antibiotic in this context , '' harrison said . `` we were going from a mature , established population of a few billion cells , all stuck together in this highly protected __biofilm__ coat , to really just a few thousand cells left alive . this is a massive , massive killing ability . '' __diggle__ said the team also asked collaborators in the u.s. to test the recipe using an `` in __vivo__ '' wound model -- meaning it 's in a live organism -- `` and basically the big surprise was that it seems to be more effective than conventional antibiotic treatment . '' the scientists were worried they would n't be able to repeat the feat . but three more batches , made from scratch each time , have yielded the same results , harrison said , and the __salve__ appears to retain its potency for a long time after being stored in bottles in the refrigerator . the team says it now has good , replicated data showing that the medicine kills up to 90 % of mrsa bacteria in `` in __vivo__ '' wound biopsies from mice . harrison says the researchers are still not completely sure how it works , but they have a few ideas -- namely , that there might be several active components in the mixture that work to attack the bacterial cells on different fronts , making it very hard for them to resist ; or that by combining the ingredients and leaving them to steep in alcohol , a new , more potent __bacteria-fighting__ molecule is created in the process . `` i still ca n't quite believe how well this __1,000-year-old__ antibiotic actually seems to be working , '' harrison said . `` when we got the first results we were just utterly dumbfounded . we did not see this coming at all . '' she added : `` obviously you can never say with utter certainty that because it works in the lab it 's going to work as an antibiotic , but the potential of this to take on to the next stage and say , ` yeah , really does it work as an antibiotic ' is just beyond my wildest dreams , to be honest . '' lee , who translated the text from old english , believes the discovery could change people 's views of the medieval period as the `` dark ages . '' `` the middle ages are often seen as the ` dark ages ' -- we use the term ` medieval ' these days ... as __pejorative__ -- and i just wanted to do something that explains to me how people in the middle ages looked at science , '' she said .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- when indiana gov. michael pence signed his state 's religious freedom restoration act -lrb- __rfra__ -rrb- , he apparently did not anticipate the resulting uproar . many of indiana 's businesses fear that the law could be used to allow store owners to deny service to gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender -lrb- lgbt -rrb- persons . the ncaa has expressed concern about the final four , which indianapolis is hosting this weekend , and other companies have threatened to move their businesses outside of the state . but , when pushed on the issue , pence insisted that the law is `` not about discrimination '' but instead is `` about protecting the religious liberty of every __hoosier__ of every faith . '' when asked whether he would allow an amendment to clarify that the law will not preclude anti-discrimination protections , the governor __doubled-down__ , noting that `` we 're not going to change this law . '' but members of the indiana legislature beg to differ with the governor , pledging to `` fix '' indiana 's __rfra__ . and now , the governor has changed his tune , also calling for a fix to the bill . can there really be an easy `` fix , '' short of repealing the act ? the answer is , of course , it depends . under __rfras__ like indiana 's , people are not free to __disobey__ any law in tension with their religious convictions . instead , __rfras__ create a standard to balance a person 's religious interests against the governmental policy at stake . under indiana 's __rfra__ , the government must show that its policy interest advances a compelling state interest and is the least restrictive means to address the problem at issue . the question would then become whether anti-discrimination laws advance a compelling interest in the least restrictive means . the answer to that question is easy : yes . the adoption of such laws have long been viewed as advancing compelling state interests , and the only way to eliminate discrimination is to ban it , so they are the least restrictive means . at present in indiana , there is no __state-level__ law that protects lgbt persons from discrimination by private parties . in certain cities and other , local jurisdictions , however , there are ordinances prohibiting such discrimination . indiana would have two ways to `` fix '' the __rfra__ problem . the first would be to adopt __state-wide__ __nondiscrimination__ laws that protect lgbt persons . such an act would confirm that , as a matter of state policy , protecting the lgbt community is viewed as a compelling state interest . this would bring indiana into alignment with illinois , which has a __rfra__ , but which also has a comprehensive __nondiscrimination__ statute , __ameliorating__ any concerns about the __rfra__ being used in discriminatory fashion . given the __wishy-washy__ answer that gov. pence provided when asked whether he thought discrimination against lgbt persons was appropriate , the likelihood of indiana adopting a comprehensive __nondiscrimination__ statute seems remote at best , eliminating this fix as an option . another possibility would be to amend the statute to confirm that any federal , state , or local __nondiscrimination__ laws constitute a compelling state interest for the purposes of the __rfra__ . importantly , federal law does not protect lgbt persons from discrimination by private actors , and neither does indiana state law . but this language would expressly carve out local ordinances from the scope of the __rfra__ , such as the __nondiscrimination__ ordinance in indianapolis . in essence , this would preserve much of the law as it existed before the __rfra__ : absent local __nondiscrimination__ laws , persons are free in indiana to discriminate against lgbt persons on any basis . this amendment , however , would make clear that the __state-level__ __rfra__ can not be used to trump local city ordinances that protect the lgbt community . what are the odds of this second fix ? well , that precise amendment was proposed -- and adopted -- in the georgia legislature as it considered a __rfra__ comparable to indiana 's . the result : the bill 's sponsors tabled it , noting that the exception for local __nondiscrimination__ laws would `` gut '' the bill . that reaction shines a light on the true motivations for these __rfras__ . if these acts are n't about discrimination , then why would ensuring __nondiscrimination__ protections `` gut '' the bill ? it 's because these bills truly are about permitting discrimination against the lgbt community . all of the __hand-waving__ by gov. pence and others can not distract from the truth : __rfras__ are the first responses to lgbt advances .

ARTICEL:     london -lrb- cnn -rrb- previously secret correspondence between britain 's prince charles and government officials is to be made public after a supreme court ruling thursday . the guardian newspaper had been fighting for the communications to be released since 2005 . charles is next in line to the british throne and as king would constitutionally be required to maintain strict political neutrality . some commentators say letters to officials suggest he could be a `` meddling king , '' attempting to influence politicians . after the judgment was released thursday , guardian editor-in-chief alan rusbridger said the paper was `` delighted '' about the supreme court 's decision after what he said was a `` brilliant 10-year campaign by guardian reporter rob evans . '' `` the government wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds trying to cover up these letters , admitting their publication would ` seriously damage ' perceptions of the prince 's political neutrality . now they must publish them so that the public can make their own judgment , '' rusbridger said . max foster , cnn 's royal correspondent , says the letters are part of a broader discussion about the role of the heir to the throne . `` these were private letters , never meant for public consumption , which is why the prince 's office has resisted their release , '' he said . `` but they play into a much bigger debate about the role of monarchy . should charles be getting involved in politics at all when , as head of state , he 'll be expected to be politically neutral ? he 's not in that position yet so feels he has some leeway . '' prime minister david cameron said the judgment was `` disappointing '' and the government would now look at how to release the letters . `` this is about the principle that senior members of the royal family are able to express their views to government __confidentially__ . i think most people would agree this is fair enough , '' he said . cameron suggested the legislation might need revision in light of the decision : `` our foi -lrb- freedom of information -rrb- laws specifically include the option of a governmental veto , which we exercised in this case for a reason . if the legislation does not make parliament 's intentions for the veto clear enough , then we will need to make it clearer . '' the prince 's official residence , clarence house , issued a brief statement about the decision . `` this is a matter for the government . clarence house is disappointed the principle of privacy has not been upheld . '' the __anti-monarchy__ group republic welcomed the news but warned that 2010 changes to the freedom of information act to remove the public interest clause put future releases at risk . `` the government must now act to end royal secrecy . any risk to the monarchy must pale against a risk to democracy from having an activist prince acting in secret , '' ceo graham smith said . `` we ca n't have a situation where we do n't know what influence charles is having on government policy . '' in a statement issued on the eve of the decision , smith branded the monarchy one of britain 's `` most secretive institutions . '' `` charles clearly has his own political agenda , yet his name wo n't be on the ballot in may . so we all need to know what influence he is trying to exert and what impact he is having on policy . '' evans , the guardian reporter , had been fighting a legal battle to get the letters published since 2005 when he requested disclosure of communications between charles and various government departments under the uk 's freedom of information act and environmental regulations . after the departments and the information commissioner denied his requests , evans appealed to the information tribunal , which referred the matter to the upper tribunal . the guardian reported in 2009 that charles had written to treasury , foreign office and education department ministers over the previous three years and that his aides had also written letters to government officials . `` the disclosures will fuel growing concern that the prince is continuing to interfere in political matters when many believe he should remain neutral if he wishes to become king , '' the paper said . the upper tribunal ruled in 2012 that many of the letters , `` advocacy correspondence , '' should be disclosed , but its decision was vetoed by britain 's attorney general , who issued a certificate overriding it . explaining his decision , the attorney general said that in that his view , the correspondence was `` undertaken as part of the prince of wales ' preparation for becoming king '' and contained nothing that outweighed `` strong public interest against disclosure . '' the guardian challenged the veto in court , but three high court judges dismissed it , so evans appealed to the supreme court , which on thursday ruled that the attorney general was not entitled to issue the certificate .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- britain 's lewis hamilton made the perfect start to his world title defense by winning the opening race of the f1 season in australia sunday to lead a mercedes one-two in melbourne . __polesitter__ hamilton controlled the race on the albert park street circuit to win from teammate nico rosberg of germany . four-time world champion sebastian vettel took the final podium position for his new team ferrari , holding off felipe massa in the __willams__ . it was the 34th career victory for two-time world champion hamilton and underlined the continued dominance of mercedes as he and rosberg pulled well clear of their nearest challengers . hamilton , who was forced to retire early in last year 's australian grand prix , was taking the checkered flag in melbourne for the first time since 2008 , when he claimed his first world title for mclaren . it had all gone completely to plan until coming face to face on the victory podium with movie legend arnold schwarzenegger , who was conducting the post-race interviews . `` hey man , wow , '' said a surprised hamilton . `` it is an incredibly feeling to continue winning but also great to be up here with you . '' then taking his courage in his hands , hamilton cheekily told ` the terminator ' `` i thought you were taller ! '' after getting the thoughts of rosberg and vettel , who said it was a `` very big honor '' to gain his first points for ferrari , schwarzenegger turned his attention back to hamilton . the pair signed off by saying together : `` i 'll be back , '' the catchphrase from schwarzenegger 's iconic 1984 film . with hamilton winning his seventh race from eight starts , his f1 rivals would probably rather he stayed away and rosberg admitted `` he was driving to his max '' but could not match the pace of his teammate . only 11 cars finished the race from a depleted grid of 15 cars , with valtteri bottas unable to start for williams due to a back injury . pastor maldonado crashed out on the first lap as the safety car was deployed , while his teammate romain grosjean retired early in the __58-lap__ race to complete a miserable afternoon for lotus . britain 's jenson button in an __uncompetitive__ mclaren was the only driver to finish without a point in 11th place . his regular teammate fernando alonso sat out the race after his nasty crash in pre-season testing in barcelona , while stand-in kevin magnussen retired after the warm-up lap . kimi raikkonen looked set to underline ferrari 's improvement when running in fifth place , but had to retire the car , with tv replays indicating his left rear tire was not fitted properly after a pit stop . it left the way clear for rookie felipe nasr of brazil to claim an unexpected fifth place for sauber , which went through the 2014 season without claiming a single point , and also took eighth spot with marcus ericsson . home hopes rested with daniel ricciardo , third in last year 's title race , but he looked off the pace in the red bull in sixth place . force india pair nico hulkenberg and sergio perez finished seventh and 10th , with carlos sainz jr. impressing on his f1 debut for toro rosso in ninth . dutch teenager max verstappen made f1 history by becoming the youngest driver to compete in an f1 race at 17 years and 166 days , but his hopes were dashed when forced to retire in his toro rosso on the 34th lap .

'' spieth has long been heralded as the next big thing in golf -- shining in the amateur ranks with two u.s. junior titles and leading last year 's masters after the third round before eventually finishing tied for second , three shots behind bubba watson . on sunday , he held his nerve at the __innisbrook__ resort in palm harbor , florida , to hold on for the victory . he first rescued par on the 16th with a __60-foot__ bunker shot and needed a __32-foot__ putt to ensure his place in the playoff , which he duly holed . it was a putt of similar length that ensured a second tour win to add to his john __deere__ classic success in july 2013 , which he also won courtesy of a playoff making him the youngest pga tour winner for 82 years at the time .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     jordan spieth only the fourth player since 1940 to seal two pga tour wins under age of 22 . golfing 's newest star sets his sights on __usurping__ rory mcilroy as the world 's no. 1 . confidence is high going into the masters , in which he finished second a year ago .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- from an iconic marble statue of a heavily pregnant disabled artist to the more recent giant blue cockerel , london 's fourth plinth art project has always provided a controversial modern twist to the traditional landmarks around london 's trafalgar square . the latest offering , `` gift horse , '' which took up residence in the square 's northwest corner thursday , looks set to continue the tradition with a work that explores the link between power , money and history , according to organizers . unveiled by london 's mayor boris johnson , the sculpture created by german-born conceptual artist hans __haacke__ portrays a skeletal __riderless__ horse with an __ribbon-shaped__ electronic ticker tied to its left leg showing live market data from london 's stock exchange . '' ` gift horse ' is a startlingly original comment on the relationship between art and commerce and i hope it will stimulate as much debate as other works that have appeared on the plinth , '' johnson said . the __13-feet__ high bronze skeleton is a `` wry comment , '' organizers say , on the equestrian statue of king william iv originally planned , but never realized for the plinth more than 150 years ago . further nods to the past and the sculpture 's location can be found in the pose which is based on the engraving `` the anatomy of a horse '' by english artist george stubbs , whose famous equine portraits hang on the walls of the national gallery on trafalgar square 's north side . one of london 's most famous landmarks , trafalgar square is popular with tourists . named after a famed 1805 british naval victory against the french , its centerpiece is a column commemorating lord horatio nelson , who died during the conflict . in a career spanning __half-a-century__ , __haacke__ has frequently explored the __interconnectedness__ of art , power and money through installations , paintings , photography and written text . many of __haacke__ 's most famous works have explored systems , be it physical -- as evidenced by his famous 1960s work `` condensation cube '' -- or the social and political as seen in `` __moma__ poll '' -lrb- 1970 -rrb- , `` a breed apart '' -lrb- 1978 -rrb- and more recently his `` der __bevölkerung__ '' -lrb- the people -rrb- installed in germany 's __reichstag__ building in berlin in 2000 . `` it 's a very prominent spot , '' said the 78-year-old , reflecting on the `` gift horse 's '' positioning in trafalgar square , `` it 's very beautiful . everybody sees it . '' `` there are other statues and the idea of having the empty plinth which has been made available periodically for artists is a great idea , '' added __haacke__ . around trafalgar square there was mixed reaction to the sculpture . `` it definitely does n't look like a horse 's head , does it ? looks more __dinosaur-ish__ to me , '' said a slightly baffled female __day-tripper__ from wales , while another tourist seemed equally confused . `` my first impression was that it looked like an alien , because you see it and then you think , huh ? what is it ? '' said toni , visiting from switzerland . local reaction was more positive though . `` i just think it 's very witty , '' said londoner tony francis . `` i can see the -lrb- george -rrb- stubbs influence . and i love the stock exchange -lrb- ribbon -rrb- scrolling round and the way they merge into each other . '' `` gift horse '' is the 10th artwork to sit on the plinth and follows the `` __hahn/cock__ , '' created by german artist katharina __fritsch__ which was in residence from july 2013 to february this year .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- i was deeply moved watching julianne moore win the oscar for `` still alice , '' a movie i was proud and privileged to be an executive producer on . julianne gives a harrowing performance as a brilliant 50-year-old college professor who loses her brain and herself to __early-onset__ alzheimer 's disease . this is a huge moment for julianne -- and a huge moment for all of us who have been trying to focus public attention on this staggering disease . witnessing alzheimer 's progress on the big screen is as terrifying as it is in real life . i know , because i 'm a child of alzheimer 's . the mind of my father , sargent shriver , had always been a finely tuned instrument that left people in awe and inspired . but my family and i watched alzheimer 's erase that brain -- slowly , __inexorably__ , completely . it was terrifying , too , because back then , the disease was surrounded by shame and silence . alzheimer 's still carries a stigma of the unknown -- even though today more than 5 million americans have it . that 's right . every 67 seconds , another one of us develops alzheimer 's . women in their 60s are about twice as likely to develop alzheimer 's as breast cancer . with 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every day , there will be 13.5 million of us with alzheimer 's by 2050 . and many people do n't understand that alzheimer 's is n't a natural part of aging . alzheimer 's is a disease that kills . the truth is , we 're right in the middle of an epidemic , but we as a nation are in denial . an oscar for `` still alice '' is shining the brightest light yet on alzheimer 's , but light is n't enough anymore . attention is n't enough . it 's time to get serious . alzheimer 's is exerting a powerful impact on american families -- on our health , our finances , and our futures . and women are disproportionately affected . why women ? back in 2010 , when we published `` the shriver report : a woman 's nation takes on alzheimer 's , '' we reported that women were more than half the individuals diagnosed with alzheimer 's and nearly two-thirds of the unpaid caregivers of those who had it . now those numbers are far worse . today nearly two-thirds of those with alzheimer 's are women -- that 's more than 3.2 million women . and more than 60 % of caregivers for people with alzheimer 's and dementia are women , with many having to reduce their own workload or even drop out of the workforce altogether to care for loved ones . opinion : why ` still alice ' is about you . women are the epicenter of this crisis , which is why i believe they also have to be the solution . so , in partnership with the alzheimer 's association and so many inspiring women already working on the front lines to fight this disease , we have launched the wipe out alzheimer 's challenge , a __multipronged__ campaign powered by women 's brains . our mission is to enlist women of all ages to get educated , engaged and empowered to instigate change . women around the country will go out and raise the alarm , raise awareness , raise the stakes and raise millions of dollars to fund serious research into women 's brains . and there 's so much research to do and so many questions to answer . why is the incidence of alzheimer 's higher for women ? nobody knows . and why is it that women in their 60s are so much more likely to get alzheimer 's than breast cancer ? nobody knows . what 's the exact role of estrogen ? we do n't know . is there an alzheimer 's connection with depression or with diabetes ? what about genetics ? what can be done during the 20 or so years when the disease develops , before a woman even becomes symptomatic ? what 's the impact of diet , stress level , exercise , sleep and cardiovascular condition ? it 's time to find out . we have to fund this research , because for some reason it 's not a priority for the government . in 2015 , washington will spend an estimated $ 6 billion on cancer research and $ 3 billion on hiv/aids research , but only $ __586__ million on alzheimer 's . yet , as the alzheimer 's association tells us , `` the costs to all payers for the care of people living with alzheimer 's disease and other __dementias__ will total an estimated $ 226 billion , with medicare and medicaid paying 68 percent of the costs . '' i do n't get it , but i 'm not going to wait anymore . so wipe out alzheimer 's is stepping in . we 're asking women to put together their own `` brain trusts '' in their communities -- groups that will go out and do some muscular fund-raising . but equally important , these brain trusts will gather to discuss and disseminate information about what the disease is and is n't . what are the warning signs we should look for in ourselves and our parents ? what 's the difference between normal __forgetfulness__ , dementia and alzheimer 's disease ? can brain games or meditation slow cognitive decline ? do dietary supplements help ? local brain trust groups will also learn about the devastatingly high cost of alzheimer 's -- how neither medicare nor the affordable care act covers long-term care , and the cost of a __semiprivate__ nursing home room averages more than $ 80,000 a year . they 'll reach out to help and encourage women whose loved ones have alzheimer 's . they will be politically engaged and encourage political candidates who support increased funding for alzheimer 's research . they 'll push their own doctors to get __better-educated__ about cognitive health . it 's time for the narrative around alzheimer 's to change . i remember when an hiv/aids diagnosis was a death sentence . i remember when cancer was a dirty word , and the prognosis was always grim . but aids and cancer activists are helping to take these diseases from terrifying to treatable , from hopeless to hopeful . we want to do the same with alzheimer 's . we want to understand it , prevent it , treat it and beat it . wipe out alzheimer 's is creating a global community of women activists , __agitators__ and agents of change to do just that . we used to think that the mysterious condition called alzheimer 's disease happened only to folks in their 80s and 90s . `` still alice '' shows us that 's just not true . the race for the oscar may be over , but the race to wipe out alzheimer 's is on .

ARTICEL:     lausanne , switzerland -lrb- cnn -rrb- talks to reach a deal on a framework agreement on iran 's nuclear program will be extended an extra day , u.s. officials said tuesday . '' we 've made enough progress in the last days to merit staying until wednesday . there are several difficult issues still remaining , '' state department spokeswoman marie harf said . white house press secretary josh earnest said the talks in lausanne would continue another day as `` long as the conversations continue to be productive . '' diplomats and negotiators worked late as an initial deadline approached , but more time appeared necessary to reach a framework deal . how long talks will continue was unclear . french foreign minister laurent fabius informed the iranians that he will return to paris at dawn wednesday in an apparent effort to force the iranians ' hand , western diplomatic sources told cnn . hamid __ba'idinejad__ from iran 's foreign ministry said earlier tuesday there are no `` artificial '' deadlines and a deal will be reached , when each issue has been resolved . diplomats told cnn that there has been progress , but gaps remain . for iran , that means there 's a light at the end of the tunnel for crippling sanctions . for the west , it means real hope that it 's possible to loosen up on tehran while still being confident that it wo n't develop nuclear weapons . the international sanctions relief issue has been resolved , according to __ba'idinejad__ . `` we have had long discussions on this , but there are issues that are related to sanctions that are still under consideration , '' __ba'idinejad__ said . he added that is not the only issue that needs to be worked out . the thing is , nuclear physics is complicated . so are the international dynamics anytime you 're talking about iran and the west , with mutual distrust and contempt a shared sentiment for years . that 's why it 's taken so long to even get to this point , and why what 's happening in lausanne matters . before you can iron out __nitty-gritty__ technical details in a permanent , comprehensive pact -- which carries the more important deadline of june 30 -- you have to agree on what you 're going to talk about . what happens if wednesday passes and there 's no framework agreement ? in the short term , it appears , not much . iran 's power rises , with or without deal . the real deadline is n't for three months , after all . as for the march 31 date , there 's nothing to stop the parties from continuing to talk -- though an iranian official told state-run press tv that no one had raised the idea of an extension as of late monday . `` all emphasize that the chance should not be missed , and they are all doing their best , '' __ba'idinejad__ said . so far , there 's been a lot of meetings , with occasional smiles for cameras followed by foreign ministers talking behind closed doors . after working through the previous night , representatives from the key players -- most of them foreign ministers -- met all day tuesday to try to resolve differences in what chinese foreign minister wang yi described as `` the final stage '' of `` these __marathon-like__ negotiations . '' the parties are either on the verge of a milestone agreement or still separated on some crucial points , depending on who you listen to . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov is among the __optimists__ . russia has been closer than most to iran even as it 's gone along with sanctions . `` prospects for this round of talks are not bad , i would even say good , '' lavrov said before heading to switzerland for the final round of negotiations , according to state-run sputnik news agency . `` the chances are high . '' but in comments monday to cnn , a more cautious kerry conceded there was `` a little more light there today , but there are still some tricky issues . '' `` there still remain some difficult issues , '' the top u.s. diplomat said . `` we are working very hard to work those through ... with a view to get something done . '' 21 questions on iranian nuclear talks . iran has been under intense international pressure and has faced crippling sanctions over its nuclear program for years . the sides began moving away from stalemate with iranians ' 2013 election of president hassan rouhani , who has insisted that iran wants a peaceful nuclear energy program but not weapons . viewed as a moderate -- especially compared with other powerful figures in iran , including the country 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei -- rouhani campaigned on a platform that he 'd work to help iran 's economy by reducing its rifts with the outside world . his government has had some success easing those tensions , spearheading interim agreements that have loosened some sanctions . but a comprehensive and final deal has remained elusive . there 's been discussion on what to do with iran 's existing __fissile__ material -- which is important because , as long as it 's still around , that will make it easier to produce a nuclear weapon more quickly . still , u.s. officials suggested monday the debate over this has been overblown , with harf calling it one outstanding issue though `` it has n't , quite honestly , been one of the toughest ones . '' more important are three points that have dominated the talks in lausanne : . • how quickly or slowly iran will be allowed to advance its nuclear technology in the last five years of the 15-year agreement . • how quickly the crushing u.n. sanctions will go away . • whether sanctions will snap back into place if iran violates the deal . iran wants them gone for good . lavrov claims that the u.n. security council will lift the sanctions right away , but other international negotiators want to merely suspend them , so they can be __reapplied__ as leverage if iran does not keep its end of the bargain . agreement on those points is crucial , a western diplomat said . `` there can not be an agreement if we do not have answers to these questions , '' the diplomat said . another point of contention : what to do with the nuclear substances iran already has . diplomats had told journalists about a plan for iran to ship its __fissile__ material to russia . the idea is that if tehran does n't have a nuclear stockpile at its fingertips , it will have a longer `` breakout time '' to make a nuclear weapon should negotiations fall apart . iran is n't ready to do that , one of its negotiators said sunday . `` the export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program , '' iranian deputy foreign minister abbas __araghchi__ said , `` and we do not intend to send them abroad . '' but on monday , u.s. officials said the rumblings in the media about the stockpile issue were overblown . negotiators had not yet decided any specifics about the disposal of __fissile__ material , and iran has made the comments many times before , a senior state department official said , citing a list of previous examples of such statements in press reports . with or without a deal , a lot can change in the next three months . for one , the devil is in the details -- any one of which could throw everyone back to square one . then there 's the possibility that a deal ironed out in switzerland is rejected by any of the key players . that 's been raised as a possibility in the united states , even though a washington __post-abc__ news poll conducted in the past few days found that 59 % of respondents support a deal in iran that would restrict its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions . earlier this month , 47 republican senators wrote directly to the iranian government , reminding it that any deal it reaches with u.s. president barack obama might be moot once his term ends in less than two years . one person leading the charge against a possible deal , even though he 'll have no direct part in shaping it , is israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu . reiterating points he made earlier this month to the u.s. congress , netanyahu said tuesday `` the greatest threat to our security and safety and our future is iranians ' attempt to become nuclear . '' `` and the agreement that is being formed in lausanne , '' the israeli leader said , `` is paving the road to that result . '' cnn 's elise labott reported from lausanne , and steve almasy and greg botelho reported and wrote from atlanta . jethro mullen wrote and reported from hong kong . cnn 's ben brumfield , jim sciutto , __nimet__ __kirac__ and catherine e. shoichet contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- it was nothing if not predictable . take combustible issues like religion and sexuality , stir in a new law and talk of a boycott , then -- boom ! -- the debate on social media explodes . and so it has proved with indiana 's new `` religious freedom '' law , signed thursday by gov. mike pence . the new law could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers if serving them would __contravene__ the business owner 's religious beliefs . supporters of the bill say it protects their right to believe as they choose . opponents say it is nothing but bigotry dressed up as liberty . the debate is nothing if not vitriolic . and colorful , too . `` __libs__ __shutup__ , '' reads one tweet , which goes on to assert that indiana 's `` __relgious__ freedom __restauration__ act -lrb- sic -rrb- '' is modeled on federal legislation signed by president bill clinton in 1993 . people on the other side of the debate are equally emphatic -- and , it seems for the moment , more numerous . some have likened the new law to permitting businesses to discriminate against black people , if __perchance__ their religion dictated that . others say that indiana seems out of step with modern times . and then there is the business reaction -- both the nascent boycott from outside the state and the rush by some businesses inside the state to declare that , law or no law , they have no intention of turning anyone away . `` my team just canceled travel to in due to the __#religiousfreedomrestorationact__ , '' tweeted a user under the name mark c somerville , who says he works for __@salesforce__ . `` we stand against discrimination . '' and a tweet from a the st. elmo steak house , a business in indianapolis , the state 's capital and its largest city , pledged in capital letters to continue serving all . the word freedom should only be used when it 's inclusive and fair for all . supporters of the law , however , made it clear what they thought opponents should do with their proposed boycott . `` before you go and get too __self-righteous__ w / your __#boycottindiana__ , '' a user called caleb __parke__ tweeted , '' __@govpencein__ is protecting __#religiousfreedom__ for everyone ! __#equalrights__ . ''
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     social media supporters of indiana 's `` religious freedom '' bill say it protects their right to hold their own beliefs . opponents of the bill say its `` freedom '' is a cover for bigotry against gays and lesbians . some indiana businesses tweet that they will continue to serve all customers , regardless of orientation . some users take to social media in attempt to organize boycott of indiana .

ARTICEL:     jerusalem -lrb- cnn -rrb- within 48 hours of his election night victory , benjamin netanyahu rolled back his pre-election comments that there would be no palestinian state if he were prime minister , but the damage may already have been done to relations with the two other major players in the negotiations : the united states and the palestinians . in an interview with nbc , netanyahu said , `` i have n't changed my policy , i never retracted my speech six years ago calling for a demilitarized palestinian state that recognizes the jewish state . what has changed is the reality , abu __mazen__ -lrb- __nickhame__ of palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas -rrb- the palestinian leader refuses to recognize the jewish state , and he 's made a pact with hamas that calls for the destruction of israel . and every territory vacated these days in the middle east is taken up by islamist forces and we want that to change so we can realize the vision of real sustained peace . i do n't want a __one-state__ solution , i want a sustainable two-state solution . '' chief palestinian negotiator saeb __erekat__ says he believes the pre-election statement that netanyahu will not allow a two-state solution . he says the palestinians will keep pursuing statehood through the international arena instead of through negotiations . `` i 've negotiated with them for 20 years , and i complained to the international community that there is a big difference between someone being a tough negotiator which is legitimate and someone being a __non-negotiator__ , '' __erekat__ said . `` all netanyahu needs to do to gain the credibility and the trust , not only of me but of the international community , he needs to stand tall and tell the israeli people that in order to live in peace with our neighbors we 're going to have to recognize the state of palestine . '' __erekat__ says the palestinians may try again for recognition once more at the united nations , a forum where they fell one vote short of recognition as a full un member state in december . a new united nations security council consisting of different member states may be more favorable to a second palestinian bid . so where does that leave the united states ? the white house said it would `` reassess '' the relationship between the united states and israel . the broad relationship includes security cooperation , financial assistance , and strong diplomatic ties . both leaders reaffirmed the strength of those ties in the weeks before the israeli elections . but the united states has also used its veto power as a permanent member of the u.n. security council to block resolutions unfavorable to israel . some of that protection could be at stake here as the white house urges both sides back to negotiations . the last peace talks , moderated by secretary of state john kerry , broke down in april 2014 after nine months of negotiations . as the talks deteriorated before the scheduled deadline , israel withdrew from the negotiations when fatah announced a reconciliation with hamas , a militant islamic group , and an intention to form a unity government . in a phone call with netanyahu , president barack obama congratulated netanyahu and stressed the importance of a two-state solution . but with so much skepticism on both sides , a lasting peace remains a distant goal .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     the white house says it would `` reassess '' the relationship between the united states and israel . that comes after netanyahu made campaign statements against a palestinian state . netanyahu rolled back the comments after his election victory .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- `` a pilot called me last week , concerned he might have __marfan__ __syndome__ , '' a health care provider told me recently at a meeting . `` but if i find he has the disease , do i have to report him to the federal aviation administration ? and if so , should i call him first and tell him that ? would he lose his job ? '' she was totally unsure what to do . several other providers were present , and none of them knew , either . `` you should definitely call him and tell him , '' a health care lawyer , who was present , said . `` you have to provide full disclosure . '' `` but presumably , he knows that you might do so , '' i said . `` and if you told him , he might not come in for the check-up . '' __marfan__ syndrome affects connective tissue and can lead to sudden tears in the aortic artery , causing sudden death . yet if treated , it poses much less risk , though not necessarily zero . the case raised several specific __quandaries__ about what the responsibilities of medical professionals are and should be -- legally or ethically -- in evaluating pilots . the faa requires that pilots __self-report__ any diagnoses . but health care professionals have no obligation to notify anyone . they may know that a pilot has a medical problem that is poorly or not treated and may endanger passengers , but these providers have no obligation to do anything about it . these issues are crucial , given that andreas __lubitz__ deliberately crashed the __germanwings__ flight __9525__ , killing 150 passengers . we still do n't know why he committed __suicide-murder__ , but the latest reports indicate he was treated for suicidal tendencies before getting his pilot license . the __germanwings__ disaster has demonstrated that current standards of medical and psychiatric evaluation are inadequate . the faa requires only that pilots fill out a psychological questionnaire , asking whether they have had psychological symptoms . but pilots are not assessed in person by a psychiatrist . such face-to-face assessments can provide crucial information that __self-report__ forms might miss , partly because pilots might answer inaccurately . moreover , the faa requires only that 25 % of pilots have a single random drug screen per year . pilots may pass drug tests in january and realize that the odds of undergoing subsequent tests that year are nil . they may hence use more alcohol and recreational drugs . we need to consider changing current policies . some alterations are relatively easy . the faa should consider requiring far more drug testing -- for all pilots , perhaps every few days . other possible reforms pose difficult ethical dilemmas , and thus need broad , careful discussion -- e.g. , what role providers should play and how much privacy pilots should have . medical exams and records over time can indicate key problems that a single visit to an faa doctor may miss . but requiring more information from pilots diminishes their rights to privacy . indeed , such rights impeded investigators from knowing initially the reason __lubitz__ took a six-month leave and the nature of his medical condition . physicians have to break patient confidentiality when third parties may be endangered . the legal precedent for breaking patient confidentiality in this way is the so-called __tarasoff__ case , in which a young patient told his psychologist at the university of california at berkeley that he wanted to kill his girlfriend , tatiana __tarasoff__ . the psychologist alerted the campus police , though not the city police or __tarasoff__ . unfortunately , the patient then killed __tarasoff__ . a court found the psychologist liable . these violations of patient confidentiality make us providers uncomfortable . as a physician , i have had to report patients whom i even suspected might be abusing a child . i remember one patient who came to the emergency room for psychiatric problems mentioning that she sometimes hit her toddler son with the end of an electrical cord , swinging it until the thick part banged him . as i asked more , she began to cry . i felt terrible for her and was unsure how dangerous her actions were , but i erred on the side of protecting the child 's safety and contacted social services . when i told her , she nodded , then whispered thank you . she knew she needed help . still , in germany and several states , providers do not have to break patient confidentiality , even when they think the patient may endanger others . critical dilemmas arise , though , of what threshold should be used concerning which diagnoses and how much their successful treatment should matter . some diagnoses may be treatable and thus permissible if doctors examine the pilot more frequently than once a year . early in the hiv epidemic , for instance , some critics argued that __hiv-infected__ pilots should be barred from flying , since the virus could cause neurological problems . fortunately , the faa decided that evidence of actual neurological deficits -- not infection alone -- should ground these employees . physicians arguably should consider reporting pilots who have , for instance , epilepsy , __manic-depression__ or diabetes that leads to coma if these conditions are not well controlled with medications . yet stigma can make pilots fear job loss and thus hide diagnoses and not seek treatment . the faa could require that pilots seek treatment in order to fly , but some pilots may still simply cover up problems . ideally , the clinician should be able to talk with the pilot about the need not to fly and arrange a leave for a few months to improve treatment . good employee assistance programs and trust are also needed . in addition , we need research to find how much physician reporting would reduce risks or lead pilots to camouflage problems . questions still arise of whether even the suspicion of a problem that could impede function should warrant reporting . an individual may seem fine weeks or even days before becoming seriously depressed . careful , transparent discussion , involving medical experts , pilots , policymakers and others , to establish policies with clearly established __cutoffs__ are thus vital . unfortunately , suicides , for instance , are impossible to predict . but much can be done to improve the current system .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the murder earlier this month of 27-year-old __farkhunda__ at the hands of a mob that beat her to death , burned her body and tossed her into a river shocked afghanistan , a country in which unspeakable things often hit the headlines . the young woman from kabul was falsely accused of burning pages in the holy quran . what followed was the horror of mob rule , all captured on video while bystanders looked on . soon after the incident , the images of her brutal slaying went viral on social media , noted afghanistan 's __tolo__ news . and this time , the outrage led afghans to the streets , with assistance from facebook and other social media . these platforms have served both to disseminate the images of her savage beating and murder and as a means for convening those who are mobilizing and organizing to protest her killing . last week , crowds chanted for days , calling for justice for __farkhunda__ and `` death for her killers . '' and , __tolo__ news reported , protests were held in different parts of the country , calling for the `` ultimate penalty to the perpetrators . '' indeed , technology and __connectedness__ have played a role in changing the old narratives in afghanistan , as __farkhunda__ 's killing shows . not only was her murder captured and shared online , but some of those men arrested for her killing were found to have confessed via social media posts . and now a country 's anguish is shared in those same online and virtual neighborhoods . some afghan civil society leaders see the protests that have resulted as yet another sign of an evolving afghanistan -- a nation whose recently elected leaders , now sharing a unity government , visited washington , d.c. , in an effort to turn the page on the past . `` when we are talking about this case , what is it showing us ? first of all , when we are talking about women 's rights , we see that we have succeeded ; people will not tolerate what they tolerated a decade ago , '' said __nargis__ __nehan__ , founder and executive director of equality for peace and democracy , a non-governmental organization created to promote `` a culture of peace , tolerance , transparency and accountability . '' she was speaking last tuesday at a roundtable at georgetown university 's institute for women , peace and security , organized around the visit by afghan president ashraf ghani and chief executive abdullah abdullah . `` if this was the afghanistan of a decade before and this would have happened , a small group of afghan women would have come to the streets to be seeking justice . today we have men seeking justice . '' __nehan__ explained that the younger generation , a progressive generation , wants to have a peaceful afghanistan . `` but at the same time , we have conservatives who have been __power-holders__ for many decades in afghanistan and they do n't want to see that . change always has a cost and unfortunately in this case we see that a very innocent girl like __farkhunda__ has paid that . '' __nehan__ and other leaders from afghanistan could be seen checking facebook frequently for updates on what was happening on the streets of their capital . what they found was an online community sustaining the strong sense of injustice over __farkhunda__ 's killing that prompted the afghan president to announce , even before he left for the united states , a fact-finding commission to investigate her murder . yet some afghan leaders worried that the brutality of this murder marked another troubling turning point in a country wrestling with a great many transitions -- economic , security and political -- all at once . `` it never -lrb- before -rrb- happened to women at this level ; this was really one of the shocking acts of violence publicly within the capital , '' said __sima__ samar , head of the afghan human rights commission , at the georgetown panel . `` it is not far from the palace , less than one kilometer . '' `` my personal concern is that if we do not manage the case properly , it might be used against us and against women 's rights in the country , '' samar added . women have gained a great deal in the roughly 13 years since the taliban was ousted from power . today , 3 million girls attend school . women serve in the country 's security forces -- albeit in very small numbers . they sit in parliament and work as entrepreneurs , teachers and civil society advocates . still , violence against women remains rampant and widespread . the practice of child marriage is outlawed but still common in some parts of the country . and security and the economy are still major challenges , particularly in the more remote provinces of the country untouched by the modernization gripping the nation 's more urban centers . indeed , samar and other human rights advocates and civil society leaders who have played a role in __post-taliban__ afghanistan say they are determined that __farkhunda__ 's death will not be in vain . they say they will continue to fight to keep her case in the spotlight and to see justice served . their commitment to seeking public justice for a public horror may well be one of the most powerful signals yet of an afghanistan that is indeed a very different nation than it was only a decade ago .

' '' read the full open letter from marvin gaye 's children below : . an open letter from the children of marvin gaye __3/18/15__ . we want to extend our deepest appreciation and gratitude for the outpouring of love and support we have received from all of our father 's fans and friends , as well as artists and industry folks who contacted us surrounding the recent events concerning his song , `` got to give it up . '' your kindness and encouragement gave us incredible strength and perseverance . we are so incredibly grateful for your support as well as the hard work and dedication of our amazing legal team and experts . we thank you all . we especially want to thank our mom jan for her belief in what we were doing all along , and for her never ending support . we will celebrate what would have been our dad 's 76th birthday next month , and though we miss him every day -- just like the many thousands of well-wishers who have expressed their heartfelt goodwill - it is through his music that we find our compass and our paths moving forward . we are his children , but we too are his fans and we hold his music dear . it is in that spirit and on behalf of all those who dad always considered an extended family , his fans , we take this opportunity to set the record straight on a few misconceptions echoing through some news and social media platforms about our intentions , our plans , and the so-called ` larger ' ramifications of this case within the music industry . originally released in 1977 , `` got to give it up '' became one of our dad 's most cherished hits , still a favorite at backyard barbecues , weddings , parties , on the radio , or on your ipod . as oprah said , it is one of her `` favorite party songs of all time . '' the comments on social media , emails and calls we received after the verdict affirmed for us that the song continues to touch in even deeper ways , becoming part of the soundtrack to so many lives . `` got to give it up '' is also recognized by billboard magazine as the fourth biggest single of the 30 charting hits our dad created during his extraordinary career . it has been nearly 38 years since its initial release : tastes change , trends evolve , but we should all be able to agree that it 's a testament to the enduring power of `` got to give it up '' that we have arrived at this juncture with mr. thicke and mr. williams , at all . the fact that they have openly acknowledged their respect and admiration for the song is public knowledge , and further proof of its resonance with an entirely new generation of music fans . however , most songwriting begins with an organic approach ; a songwriter brings his or her influences to the table and then works creatively from a blank slate in the crafting of their song to ensure originality and the integrity of their creation . if mr. thicke and mr. williams had tried to create a new song and coincidentally infused `` got to give it up '' into their work , instead of deliberately undertaking to `` write a song with the same groove , '' we would probably be having a different conversation . like most artists , they could have licensed and secured the song for appropriate usage ; a simple procedure usually arranged in advance of the song 's release . this did not happen . we would have welcomed a conversation with them before the release of their work . this also did not happen . instead of licensing our father 's song and giving him the appropriate songwriter credit , robin thicke and pharrell williams released `` blurred lines '' and then filed a pre-emptive lawsuit against us , forcing us into court . they sought to quickly affirm that their song was `` starkly different , '' than `` got to give it up . '' the judge denied their motion for summary judgement , and a jury was charged with determining the `` __extrinsic__ and intrinsic similarities '' of the songs . the jury has spoken . we wanted to also make clear that the jury was not permitted to listen to the actual sound recording of `` got to give it up . '' our dad 's powerful vocal performance of his own song along with unique background sounds were eliminated from the trial , and the copyright infringement was based entirely on the similarity of the basic musical compositions , not on `` style , '' or `` feel , '' or `` era , '' or `` genre . '' his song is so iconic that its basic composition stood strong . we feel this further __amplifies__ the __soundness__ of the verdict . like all music fans , we have an added appreciation for songs that touch us in mysterious ways . mr. thicke and mr. williams certainly have a right to be inspired by `` got to give it up '' but as the jury ruled , they did not have the right to use it without permission as a blueprint for a track they were constructing . great artists like our dad intentionally build their music to last , but we as the caretakers of such treasures , have an obligation to be vigilant about preserving the integrity of the music so that future generations understand its origins and feel its effect as the artist intended , and to assure that it retains its value . we feel as many do that , our father , marvin gaye , is an artist for the ages . but whether we 're talking about a work created 50 years ago or a work created 50 years from now -- protecting the legacy of original artistry is not a personal obligation , but a universal commitment in support of enduring creative achievement , encouraging future artists to also aim for new ground and their own legacies . that is what copyright laws help us do ; they give people the incentive to write original songs and then help protect those songs . our dad spent his life writing music - that is his legacy to us all - he wrote from his heart and was a brilliant songwriter , __arranger__ , producer and one-of-a-kind vocalist . if he were alive today , we feel he would embrace the technology available to artists and the diverse music choices and spaces accessible to fans who can stream a song at a moment 's notice . but we also know he would be vigilant about safeguarding the artist 's rights ; a sacred devotion to not only the artist , but key in encouraging and supporting innovation . he also gave credit where credit is due . howard king , the attorney for mr. thicke and mr. williams stated after the verdict : `` we owe it to songwriters around the world to make sure this verdict does n't stand . my clients know they wrote the song ` blurred lines ' from their heart and souls and no other source . '' we never for a minute suggested that mr. thicke and mr. williams ' hearts were n't in it . but a jury of eight men and women have ruled that the source for `` blurred lines '' was the song `` got to give it up , '' a song our dad wrote from his heart , and delivered to the world with pure joy . with the digital age upon us , the threat of greater infringement looms for every artist . it is our wish that our dad 's legacy , and all great music , past , present , and future , be enjoyed and protected , with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued . and finally , we want to put to rest any rumors that we are contemplating claims against pharrell williams for his song , `` happy . '' this is 100 % false . we have absolutely no claim whatsoever concerning `` happy . '' love and respect , . __nona__ , frankie , and marvin iii . copyright © 2015 rolling stone .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- an ancient ring has shed new light on the ties between vikings and the islamic world , more than a century after its discovery . the finger ring found in a 9th century swedish grave is inscribed with arabic __kufic__ writing . the letters appear to read `` __al_llh__ , researchers say , which they interpret as meaning `` __for/to__ -lrb- the approval of -rrb- allah . '' in a paper published in the journal scanning , the researchers say it is the only ring with an arabic inscription ever found at a scandinavian archaeological site . the object was originally discovered during a late 19th century grave excavation in the town of __birka__ , on __björkö__ island , about 19 miles -lrb- 30 kilometers -rrb- from stockholm . __birka__ was a key trading center during the viking age and made a unesco world heritage site in 1993 . the ring is part of the swedish history museum 's collection , originally __cataloged__ as being made of gilded silver and violet amethyst , bearing the inscription `` allah . '' researchers led by stockholm university __biophysicist__ sebastian __wärmländer__ say they used `` scanning electron microscopy -lrb- __sem__ -rrb- with energy __dispersive__ x-ray __spectroscopy__ -lrb- eds -rrb- to analyze the ring 's composition and found that it was in fact made of silver alloy and the `` amethyst '' was colored glass . `` for the stone , we must remember that even though colored glass might today be perceived as a ` fake ' material of lower value , this was not necessarily so in the past , '' the team cautioned . `` even though glass production began around 5,000 years ago in the levant it was still an exotic material in viking age scandinavia . '' more significantly , the researchers found no trace of the gold that had been assumed to coat the ring and noted the presence of filing marks . `` together with the absence of gold on the metal surface ... the file marks clearly show that the previous description of the ring as gilded was mistaken : if the surface had been gilt and the gold layer had worn away , also the file markings would be gone . but the metal surface displays no wear , and as the original file marks are still in place , this ring has never been much used . '' the team , therefore , believes the ring was passed from an arabic __silversmith__ to the woman , with few or any other owners in between . while imported coins were also found in the grave -- many from afghanistan -- they were `` usually worn and torn ... from passing many hands along the established trade routes '' researchers said . the owner of the ring was found wearing traditional scandinavian clothing , but the researchers said it was impossible to determine her ethnicity due to the decomposed state of the bones in the grave . `` it is not impossible that the woman herself , or someone close to her , might have visited -- or even originate from -- the caliphate -lrb- which then stretched from tunisia to the borders of india -rrb- or its surrounding regions , '' they said . while travel between the islamic caliphate and the viking world was recorded in ancient texts , tales of such journeys often included references to `` giants and dragons '' making it hard to tell fact from fiction , the researchers said . `` the importance of the studied __birka__ ring is that it most eloquently __corroborates__ ancient tales about direct contacts between viking age scandinavia and the islamic world . such contacts must have facilitated exchange of goods , culture , ideas , and news much more efficiently than indirect trade involving several merchants in-between , '' they concluded . modern relationship . this new evidence of ancient ties between the vikings and the caliphate comes at a time when sweden 's relationship with the modern islamic world seems to be problematic . the country 's foreign minister , margot __wallstrom__ , has recently come under scrutiny after criticizing human rights in saudi arabia . in january , she tweeted that the flogging of blogger raif badawi was `` a cruel attempt to silence modern forms of expression , '' which needed to be stopped . saudi arabia blocked __wallstrom__ from giving a speech to the arab league in cairo on march 9 , in which she planned to refer to human rights and the rights of women . sweden subsequently announced that it would not renew its memorandum of understanding with saudi arabia on military cooperation -- and in turn saudi arabia and the united arab emirates withdrew their ambassadors to sweden . the united arab emirates said it had summoned sweden 's ambassador to protest `` the abusive remarks by the foreign minister of sweden , margot __wallstrom__ , against saudi arabia .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- `` in order to attain the impossible , one must attempt the absurd , '' wrote miguel de cervantes , the shakespeare of spain . and the quest to find his remains has sometimes seemed both , even -lrb- dare one say it -rrb- __quixotic__ in a time of recession . but forensic scientists have persevered , and appear to have triumphed . almost 400 years after cervantes ' death , a team led by francisco __etxeberria__ announced tuesday that they were confident they had found cervantes ' coffin in the crypt of the convent of the barefoot __trinitarians__ in the barrio de las __letras__ -lrb- literary quarter -rrb- in madrid . historical records indicated cervantes had been buried there , but the convent had been substantially rebuilt since . -lrb- __etxeberria__ , incidentally , performed the autopsy on former chilean president gen. salvador allende , confirming he had committed suicide . -rrb- . at a news conference in madrid on tuesday , __etxeberria__ said that while there was no mathematical proof or dna test available to completely verify the findings , there were `` many coincidences and no discrepancies '' in the examination of `` __osario__ 32 , '' a common grave in the crypt that contained the remains of 16 people . `` we have cervantes , represented in some form in this group of bones that are unfortunately very degraded and very fragmented , '' __etxeberria__ told national television . the search for cervantes ' coffin -- using radar -- began last year , funded by the madrid city council . it first mapped more than 30 burial cavities in the walls and nearly 5 meters beneath the floor of the church . mass __spectrometry__ dated fragments of wood and cloth found in these cavities to the 17th century , an encouraging but far from conclusive development . one crumbling coffin found in january had the initials `` m c '' hammered in nail heads , along with a jumble of skeletal remains . even then __exteberria__ urged caution , but further research has narrowed the odds . the forensic team had been hoping that some of those remains would positively identify cervantes , who suffered gunshot wounds in the chest and left hand at the battle of __lepanto__ in __1571__ . but they are not in sufficiently good shape , and some of the remains found may be of cervantes ' wife , catalina de salazar . nor will dna analysis be much help , for there are no known descendants of cervantes . catalina was not cervantes ' first partner . as a teenager he ran away from home with a barmaid , __josefina__ de perez , before enlisting with the spanish navy . it was only in the __1580s__ that he started to write , publishing `` la __galatea__ '' in __1585__ and his most famous work , `` don __quixote__ , '' in __1605__ -- or to give its full title , `` the adventures of the ingenious __nobleman__ don __quixote__ of la __mancha__ .

ARTICEL:     sanaa , yemen -lrb- cnn -rrb- the u.s. military is in the process of evacuating about 100 special operations forces members from the al __anad__ airbase in yemen due to that country 's deteriorating security situation , sources in the region familiar with the situation told cnn . those being evacuated are the last american troops stationed in the arab nation , which is home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , the terrorist group also known as aqap . the united states closed its embassy in sanaa last month , after houthi rebels took over the yemeni capital . and hundreds of al qaeda members escaped two yemeni prisons thursday and friday , raising further security questions . for years , the u.s. military has worked closely with yemen 's government to go after aqap , together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent al qaeda figure anwar al-awlaki . and u.s. president barack obama has hailed this cooperation as a pillar in his anti-terrorism campaign . `` yemen has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability , '' obama said in january , promoting the policy of `` partnering and __intelligence-sharing__ with that local government '' as the best approach in a bad situation . `` the alternative would be for us to play __whack-a-mole__ every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country , '' the president said . but while there have been drone strikes as recently as last month , these cooperative efforts have been hampered by yemen 's growing difficulty in maintaining unity and peace . these include the rise of the houthis , their battles with forces loyal to ousted president abdu __rabu__ mansour hadi and the presence of not only al qaeda fighters but other militants . on friday , for instance , isis purportedly claimed responsibility for bombings at two mosques in sanaa what , if true , would mark that group 's first large-scale attack in yemen . the claim came in a statement posted on a site that previously carried isis __proclamations__ , but could n't be immediately authenticated by cnn . those blasts killed at least 137 people and wounded __357__ others , according to yemen 's state-run saba news agency . while isis and al qaeda are both sunni groups that __espouse__ extreme versions of islam and violent opposition to the west , that does n't mean they will be working together anytime soon . in fact , aqap strongly rebuked isis in a video released in november , characterizing its leader abu bakr al-baghdadi 's declaration of an islamic caliphate as illegitimate . more than anything , the idea of the group calling itself the islamic state violently flexing its muscles speaks to the chaotic situation there . with no one really in control , that means numerous groups -- including those with a history of killing civilians and lashing out at the west -- have been more room to operate and a better chance potentially to take over . meanwhile , the main players for control of yemen 's government -- those siding with hadi , who still claims to be president after being deposed earlier this year , and the houthis , a minority group that 's strongest in the northern part of the country -- remain very much at odds . just two days ago , a yemeni jet commanded by the capital 's houthi __conquerors__ fired missiles at a palace housing hadi in the port city of aden . no one was injured , but the direct strike nonetheless marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides . the airstrikes came on the same day opposing yemeni military forces -- some under the houthis , others led by officers loyal to hadi -- battled in aden , said aden gov. abdulaziz __hobtour__ . at least 13 people died and 21 others were injured in those clashes , according to __hobtour__ . hadi took to the airwaves of adan tv , a station he recently started , on saturday in his first televised speech since escaping house arrest . he called on all political factions to take part in upcoming talks in the saudi capital of riyadh , condemning the aden strike and urging yemeni troops to refuse orders from houthi officials . hadi tied the houthis to iran , which he was said supported the `` coup '' that led to his departure from aden . `` the iranian agenda of the houthis will not last , '' he said . needless to say , the houthis are n't convinced . mohammed al __bukhaiti__ , a top member of the houthi political council , said hadi 's speech wo n't help yemen reach a peaceful resolution and accused him of __reneging__ on a deal last september to transfer power . `` we blame hadi for not implementing this deal that drew the road map that would have solved yemen 's ongoing crises , '' al __bukhaiti__ said . `` hadi will be held responsible for the country 's failures and that chaos that could follow . '' journalist hakim __almasmari__ reported from sanaa , and cnn 's greg botelho reported and wrote from atlanta .

'' perry , who arrived on one of the first australian military flights into port vila , told cnn the damage there was `` very significant '' with trees that looked like `` snapped __toothpicks__ . '' `` it 's like a bomb has gone through , '' said journalist michael mclennan , who lives in port vila . `` it 's really quite apocalyptic . '' most buildings in the capital were destroyed or damaged , he told cnn on sunday . many roads were blocked by fallen trees or power lines . the main objective now is to get disaster response teams into __vanuatu__ and kick-start the humanitarian operation , __sune__ __gudnitz__ , regional head for the u.n. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs , told cnn from fiji , about 600 miles away . his aid agency has had word of much destruction on __efate__ , the island where port vila is located , and from the southern island of __tanna__ , he said . only a little information has so far trickled out from beyond the capital , but __gudnitz__ said he fears the worst . `` unfortunately , the more that comes out , the worse it looks , '' he said . __vanuatu__ president baldwin lonsdale , who was at a u.n. conference on disaster risk reduction in japan on saturday , issued an appeal to the global community to help his shattered nation . __vanuatu__ has officially declared a state of emergency , opening the door for other countries to help . __vanuatu__ 's remote location adds to the challenges the international response faces . port vila is more than __1,770__ kilometers -lrb- 1,100 miles -rrb- northeast of brisbane on australia 's east coast , and some 2,200 kilometers -lrb- __1,367__ miles -rrb- north of auckland , the closest city in new zealand . reaching the more isolated communities will also take time . __vanuatu__ 's archipelago -- comprising 83 small islands , about 65 of them inhabited -- is roughly 850 kilometers -lrb- __528__ miles -rrb- long . many of the people are subsistence farmers , said cnn 's bill weir , who visited __vanuatu__ recently . he recalled talking to a resident who built the first indoor bathroom on his island and sought advice on where to find a toilet paper dispenser . `` it 's setting them back years , '' weir said of the storm . people away from the capital live much as their ancestors did generations ago . homes are built of weak materials , including straw and corrugated steel , that stood little chance against pam 's raging winds . `` when you 've got a category 5 cyclone that essentially just sat here for 24 hours -- where do you go when you have a storm that powerful ? '' perry of care international said . `` it 's very terrifying to think about what people have been through . '' while international teams are finding a way in , it will be up to humanitarian agency staffers on the ground and the local communities themselves to do what they can to get by amid the wreckage . aid workers said the most immediate challenge is to get clean water to people . many people will be spending another night in emergency shelters . track the storm . pam is the south pacific 's second strongest cyclone since record-keeping began in 1970 . and it 's the strongest of any type since super typhoon haiyan smashed into the philippines in 2013 , killing more than 6,000 people . cnn 's ralph ellis , ben brumfield and laura smith-spark contributed to this report .

'' the emotional harry potter star took to the stage at facebook 's headquarters in london on sunday , march 8 , to talk about gender equality as part of international women 's day celebrations . cnn was among the live audience of around 150 people -- with millions more watching the live stream across the world -- as the 24-year-old un goodwill ambassador spoke about her own feminist journey . emma 's facebook moment . of the dozens gathered at the event , the majority were bespectacled young men -- not so unlike harry potter himself . describing the `` surreal '' moment she gave a speech at u.n. headquarters , later watched by 17 million , watson said : `` gender equality historically has been a woman 's movement . `` and how it 's affecting men has n't been addressed , '' she told moderator greg james . during the hour-long conversation , watson gave the audience a rare glimpse into her private life -- and the difference between chivalry and sexism . `` i love having the door opened for me , is n't that just polite ? '' she said . `` but i think the key is , would you then mind me opening the door for you ? '' `` chivalry should be consensual . '' and it 's not just women affected by gender inequality -- men suffer too , she added . `` i get disturbed by this idea that men ca n't cry , '' she continued . `` they ca n't express themselves and i think that 's the saddest thing in the world . being able to express yourself is what makes you human -- it 's not what makes you a girl . '' when internet trolls threatened to release naked photos of the actress , following her un speech , she said it only made her more determined in her campaign . `` if they were trying to put me off -- they did the opposite , '' she added . almost 230,000 men and boys across the world have since joined the __heforshe__ campaign , including u.s. president barack obama , and actors joseph __gordon-levitt__ and matt damon . `` i read a letter of support from a 13-year-old boy that was equally as passionate as a ceo , '' said watson , adding that she often read their stories before going to bed at night . `` i asked my younger sister : ` what would be the one thing you 'd want from boys in your life ? ' she said : ' i just want them to play with us . ' and i think that really translates at every level . we just want to be included . '' watson also talked about the inspiring influence of her mother , jacqueline , who was a `` single working mother and type one diabetic . '' `` she wanted me to be my own person and said a bit of rebellion was good , '' said watson , adding : `` she was actually thrilled when i got my first detention ... i think i failed a latin exam . '' answering questions submitted via facebook , watson said the recent lack of female representation at the academy awards showed that the fight for gender equality was far from over . `` why are women not directing their own stories ? '' she said . `` the human race is a bird -- and it needs both its wings to fly . and at the moment one of its wings is clipped , '' said watson , __paraphrasing__ famous american feminist , gloria __steinem__ . when asked what things we can all do to affect change , the actress said it was n't necessarily about grand actions -- but small ones . `` it 's everyday , it 's individual , it 's on a case by case basis , '' she said . `` whether it 's speaking up or trying to change the way someone else thinks about an issue . '' in the audience , a man wearing a hogwarts jumper asked watson whether women should be paid the same as men , when they are more likely to take maternity leave . she answered : `` i do n't think in the grand scheme of things -lsb- maternity leave -rsb- is going to hinder a woman being incredibly effective in her field . `` i think men should be equal partners in raising children .

'' capt. patrick __sondenheimer__ screamed as he banged on the cockpit door , pleading with the co-pilot . thirteen minutes later , the plane slammed into the french alps . the audio from the plane 's cockpit voice recorder has not been released , but the german newspaper bild published sunday what it claims is a summary of the transcript from the recording . cnn translated bild 's report -- which the newspaper says is based on the 1.5 hours of audio that was on the cockpit voice recorder -- but can not independently verify the information . france 's accident investigation agency , bea , told cnn that the agency is `` dismayed '' by the voice recording leak to bild . martine del bono , a spokeswoman for the agency , said the leak could not have come from a bea agent . she said the agency considers the report mere `` voyeurism . '' according to bild 's report , __sondenheimer__ told co-pilot andreas __lubitz__ that he did n't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff . __lubitz__ tells him he can go anytime . __lubitz__ is believed to have locked the pilot of flight __9525__ out of the cockpit before putting the plane on a rapid descent into the mountains , french authorities have said . the flight took off 20 minutes late . after reaching cruising altitude , __sondenheimer__ asked __lubitz__ to prepare the landing . once that 's finished , __lubitz__ again tells the captain he `` can go anytime . '' there is the sound of a seat being pushed backward after which the captain says , `` you can take over . '' at 10:29 a.m. , air traffic radar detects that the plane is starting to descend . three minutes later , air traffic controllers try to contact the plane and receive no answer -- shortly after which an alarm goes off in the cockpit , warning of the `` sink rate , '' bild reported . next comes the banging . __sondenheimer__ begs __lubitz__ to let him in . passengers then begin to scream , according to the transcript obtained by bild . another three minutes pass . a loud metallic bang is heard at 7,000 meters -lrb- almost 23,000 feet -rrb- . a minute and half later and 2,000 meters -lrb- about 6,500 feet -rrb- lower to the ground , an alarm says `` terrain -- pull up !

'' the pilot says . it 's 10:38 , and the plane is at 4,000 meters -lrb- about 13,000 feet -rrb- . __lubitz__ 's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder , according to bild 's report . two minutes later , investigators think they hear the plane 's right wing scrape a mountaintop . screams can be heard one final time . cockpit recordings are some of the most sensitive and closely held parts of aviation crash investigations . they 're never officially released , according to cnn aviation reporter richard quest . quest called it `` unbelievable '' that the black box audio would be leaked in this manner . communications between air traffic control and a plane 's cockpit can be downloaded privately , but that 's less common in europe than it is in the united states . an edited and redacted version of the transcript is usually published in part of a final report on an incident . although search teams have recovered the cockpit voice recorder , the flight data recorder remains missing . that device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight . jean pierre michel , lead investigator for the french inquiry , said on saturday that investigators are not ruling out any scenario with respect to the crash out at this point . but french authorities have said that __lubitz__ appeared to have crashed __germanwings__ flight __9525__ deliberately into the alps on tuesday as it flew from barcelona , spain , toward dusseldorf , germany , with 150 people on board . much attention has focused on __lubitz__ 's state of mind since then , with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues . __lubitz__ , 27 , passed his annual pilot __recertification__ medical examination in summer 2014 , a german aviation source told cnn . an official with lufthansa , which owns __germanwings__ , said that the exam only tests physical health , not psychological health . the official also said that the company was never given any indication __lubitz__ was depressed , and that if he went to a doctor on his own , he would have been required to __self-report__ if deemed unfit to fly . a dusseldorf clinic said he 'd gone there twice , most recently on march 10 , `` concerning a diagnosis . '' but the university clinic said it had not treated __lubitz__ for depression . the speculation about __lubitz__ ' mental state is based on a letter found in a waste bin in his dusseldorf apartment . the note , which was `` slashed , '' said __lubitz__ was not able to do his job , city prosecutor christoph __kumpa__ said friday . the fact that investigators found `` ripped , recent medical leave notes , including for the day of the offense , leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment , '' prosecutors said . __germanwings__ corroborated that assertion , saying it had never received a sick note from __lubitz__ . a handful of publications , citing unnamed sources , have reported that __lubitz__ suffered from various psychological __maladies__ . cnn has not been able to confirm these reports . __lubitz__ suffered from `` __generalized__ anxiety disorder , '' and from severe depression in the past , le parisien newspaper reported sunday , citing sources close to the investigation . in 2010 , __lubitz__ received injections of __antipsychotic__ medication , the paper said . he was also prescribed a medication that influences __neurotransmitters__ , but it 's unclear when that happened , according to le parisien . the newspaper said investigators found a handful of pills in his apartment in addition to two sick notes , which forbade him from working from march 16 to march 29 . the new york times and the wall street journal , citing unnamed sources , reported friday that __lubitz__ suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer . a subsequent report from the times on saturday , citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation , said __lubitz__ sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk . however , an official with lufthansa , said that if __lubitz__ had vision problems , they would have been discovered during his pilot __recertification__ medical examination . authorities have not ruled out the vision problems could have been __psychosomatic__ , according to the times . citing an unidentified senior investigator , german newspaper die welt said that __lubitz__ suffered from a severe `` __psychosomatic__ illness '' and that german police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition . __lubitz__ suffered from a `` severe subjective burnout syndrome '' and from severe depression , the source told the newspaper . news reports also stated that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment . investigators are expected to question his relatives , friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the co-pilot to steer a jetliner full of people into a mountainside . __lubitz__ had a girlfriend , a teacher at a school in dusseldorf not far from his apartment , according to german media . who was co-pilot andreas __lubitz__ ? dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony saturday for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town , __digne-les-bains__ , france . most of the people on the plane were from germany and spain . relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site , in the village of le __vernet__ . flowers have been laid there , in the shadow of the snow-covered peaks of the french alps . the mayor of one local community said he had seen __lubitz__ 's father on thursday evening , describing him as `` a man in deep distress .

ARTICEL:     washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- hillary clinton is pressing the reset button -- yet again . she 's quietly fighting back a week after her awkward and occasionally combative news conference on the furor over the private email server she used while running the state department . clinton 's twitter account is buzzing this week with posts that test political messages on health care , college affordability , civil rights and jobs -- issues she hopes will help mobilize president barack obama 's democratic coalition and pave her way to the presidency . meanwhile , her nascent operation is leaking details of future staffers in an __unmistakeable__ message to democrats spooked by the email flap that the __campaign-in-waiting__ will become an official effort , possibly as soon as next month . a cnn/orc international poll out on wednesday found that she 's miles ahead of any potential democratic challenger and would beat all potential republican candidates by at least 10 points . despite fretting among some democrats who worried that the party 's best -- and perhaps only -- viable democratic candidate appeared to be in trouble , early signs suggest clinton is doing what the clintons do best : mounting a comeback . `` the interest in the story is collapsing onto itself . i do n't see an organic clamoring for more information , '' said a longtime clinton ally who did n't want to speak for a campaign that has n't yet been announced . this person , who has spent time in iowa , argued that outside the community of political reporters and consultants in washington and new york who fixated on the story , the people who really count -- voters -- were n't really interested . `` people very much want to know what the campaign is going to be about ... what is she going to do about student loan costs , for example ? '' __tharon__ johnson , a democratic strategist who was southern regional director of obama 's re-election campaign in 2012 , agreed . `` if and when hillary clinton decides to run , she will have to address this issue , but i believe the american people are more interested in her addressing the kitchen table issues that matter most to them , '' he said . of course , clinton still faces plenty of challenges and the email saga raised questions about whether she can run a more sophisticated , no drama campaign than the one she managed in 2008 . but the cnn poll revealed that those critical of clinton 's role in the email affair appear to break close to party lines and her favorable rating remains at 53 % . a slow recent decline in that rating appears to coincide with clinton 's slow re-entry into partisan politics and does not necessarily reflect her recent stumbles . perhaps the most intriguing figure in the poll is that only 1 % of respondents had never heard of clinton . that supports the idea expressed by some democrats that clinton may be the most vetted figure in public life . there are people who will never vote for her and those who are dedicated to her quest to be the first female president , but very few whose minds may not be made up . a less well-known candidate might have made a terrible first impression if faced with the kind of __hyper-covered__ flap clinton was . but republicans believe the email scandal could be a political gift that keeps on giving , as it touches on a narrative that the clintons are secretive , resistant to transparency and often blur the rules . there are also other problems -- including the question of foreign funds sent to the clinton foundation and hillary clinton 's whopper speaking fees -- that republicans believe could reach a political mass and fan doubts about the likely democratic nominee 's character . then there are the foreign policy questions , including a now damaging photo op in which clinton offered a `` reset '' button to russia only for the country to revert to a cold __war-esque__ posture . she was also a central player in obama 's foreign policy , which often appears to be overtaken by the middle east 's swift descent into chaos . `` for everything that i can see , the democrats have put all of their eggs in one basket here , '' said sean spicer , communications director of the republican national committee . `` that is more of a downfall in the general election than in the primary . '' spicer argued that even with younger voters , who do not remember the clinton years , the question of impropriety over her emails could provide an entry point into past scandals . though clinton is the prohibitive democratic front-runner , her support in the party is not universal . but where she faces resistance , it is more likely to be over policy than emails , as grass-roots democrats are suspicious over her centrist , pro-business and hawkish foreign policy leanings . `` as this discussion was playing out inside the beltway , our members were focused on issues , '' said anna __galland__ , executive director of __moveon.org__ , which wants elizabeth warren to challenge clinton for the democratic nomination . __galland__ said activists were preoccupied with the preservation of the social safety net , __constraining__ wall street and those on the `` ragged edge '' of the middle class . similarly , the young voters who flocked to obama in 2008 and who will be crucial to clinton 's hopes of mobilizing an effective democratic coalition in 2016 may also offer clinton a political cushion . this group is hazy over historic references to long ago clinton scandals like __filegate__ , __travelgate__ and even the monica lewinsky episode that led to president bill clinton 's impeachment . `` the media loves a clinton scandal , '' said one democratic source who did n't want to be named because he does n't work for clinton . `` but young people are more likely to know her as secretary of state , and someone who ran for president in 2008 . '' polling bears out the theory . the cnn survey shows clinton 's __favorability__ among voters age 18 to 34 with a 22 point positive differential . but she 's barely in positive territory among voters age 50 to 64 , who are likely to have strong memories of her time as first lady , and is underwater among those 60 or older . another well-connected democrat who did n't want to go on the record criticizing clinton admitted that the email issue did play into gop caricatures about the allegedly `` __conspiratorial__ '' politicians and that it could challenge the former secretary of state 's early efforts to get her message out about her ideas and rationale for running for president . but democratic operatives think that once clinton is actually running , with an infrastructure behind her , and striking messages about the minimum wage , college debt and middle-class economic issues , voters will engage . in many ways , the email furor was a story the media could n't wait to write , so it may be that journalists have inflated the importance of the episode , at least in the absence of any evidence that clinton broke the law or made classified information vulnerable . political reporters have __pined__ for weeks for clinton to swing her campaign into action , and her failure to offer a storyline opened a vacuum that was easy for unflattering stories to fill . her slow response breathed new life into a question that only clinton can answer : will her 2016 campaign be as dysfunctional , reactive and distracted as her chaotic and unsuccessful 2008 effort ? but there were a few lessons . it 's clear the clinton machine is not about to morph into a humming , __scandal-free__ effort in the image of barack obama 's first presidential campaign . and clinton 's bitter relationship with political reporters seems as bad as ever . the days when she partied with a state department press corps more preoccupied with policy than politics seem like ancient history . but here also , clinton is trying a reset . her nascent campaign has made it known that she is staffing up her campaign and press operation . john podesta , who is expected to take a leadership role in her campaign , is respected by reporters , as is jennifer __palmieri__ , the outgoing white house communications director expected to take on a similar role for clinton . on tuesday , it emerged that clinton would name brian fallon , who has also good ties with reporters , to be lead press secretary .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- could a simple blood test someday tell if you 're genetically predisposed to post-traumatic stress disorder ? that 's what a team of international researchers is hoping after finding a genetic marker linked to ptsd in the blood samples of marines stationed in conflict zones . `` we 'll draw the blood and have a way to do this very rapidly and start to tease apart who is a little more at risk and who is a little more resilient for ptsd , '' says principal investigator dr. __dewleen__ baker of the university of __california-san__ diego . `` it 's exciting . '' ptsd can occur after many types of trauma : rape , torture , child abuse , natural disasters and car , plane , and train wrecks , to name a few . according to the ptsd alliance , more than 13 million americans have ptsd and the societal cost is in the billions . women are about twice as likely as men to develop the disorder . symptoms tend to cluster into three areas : . • reliving the event via nightmares or vivid images , along with an extreme reaction such as uncontrollable shaking , chills or heart palpitations . • avoiding reminders of the event , including becoming emotionally withdrawn and detached from friends , family and everyday activities . • being __hyperaroused__ , easily startled , irritable , angry , or having difficulty sleeping or concentrating . as one might expect , service members are hardest hit . the department of veterans affairs estimates 30 % of all vietnam vets have experienced ptsd . among troops recently deployed to iraq and afghanistan , ptsd can run as high as 20 % in any given year . but why does severe emotional trauma trigger ptsd in some people and not others ? the idea that your genes play a role in whether you develop ptsd is a popular focus of recent research . scientists have discovered genes that help regulate fear reactions in mice . the lack of a __fear-regulating__ brain chemical called __gastrin-releasing__ __peptide__ led to greater fear response among the rodents . in another study , mice without a protein necessary to form `` fear memories '' were less likely to freeze up and more willing to explore unknown spaces . studies of twins show __heredity__ accounts for about 30 % of the differences in response to trauma , with identical twins much more likely to both develop ptsd than fraternal twins . other research has looked into the role of inherited brain differences , mental disorders , or addictive tendencies . an unusual avenue of research is how our immune systems may contribute to the development of ptsd symptoms . prior studies of people diagnosed with ptsd compared to control groups without the disorder suggest differences in genes related to inflammation may play a role . `` the body is built to keep us alive and it functions as one big system , '' says baker , discussing the interface between stress and immune chemicals . `` the systems all talk to each other . '' the recent study , published in the journal molecular psychiatry , is unique because it compares blood samples from 188 marines taken before and after they were deployed to combat zones . another group of 96 marines was also studied to verify the results . `` under this experimental design , not only can we identify differences between u.s. marines with ptsd and without , but we can go back in time , so to speak , to see if any of the marines who eventually developed ptsd '' showed evidence that it would emerge , says the study 's __co-senior__ author , christopher __woelk__ . `` in this vein , we are able to start labeling findings as being __putatively__ ` causal ' in nature . '' in the blood of marines ultimately diagnosed with ptsd , the study found __biomarkers__ associated with gene networks that regulate innate immune function -- the body 's first line of defense -- and __interferon__ , a protein responsible for kicking the immune system into action . in addition , this __hypervigilant__ immune response occurred before and after exposure to trauma . `` why do certain people start out with slightly higher immune response and others have less ? is it somehow just built in or have they been exposed to some kind of pathogen ? '' asks baker . instead of pathogens , another possible explanation is that the inflammatory response is activated by the stress of going off to war . `` you could try to dampen down the activation and see if that improves symptoms or prevents development of ptsd , '' says baker . baker stresses these questions are purely hypothetical at this time and that the study needs to be replicated and expanded . `` we 're early in the process of having some clues as to what might predict risk and resilience , and with more research we 'll begin to have effective __preventions__ and treatments , '' says baker .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     more than 13 million americans have ptsd . genes account for about 30 % of risk . immune system plays a role in risk and resilience .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- so now we know . the __germanwings__ aircraft that crashed earlier this week was deliberately brought down by a co-pilot who had managed to lock himself in the cockpit as he set the plane on a course for destruction , according to officials . we all wish it were n't so , and the investigation , instead of looking at possible deficiencies of the plane , will now look to the co-pilot , who -- by all accounts -- showed no signs that this would be his horrific legacy . the irony would be rich , if it were n't so tragic . the locked door , the very mechanism put into place to protect the cockpit from unruly or dangerous passengers -- made more secure in response to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks -- was used against a pilot who , for reasons still unknown , left the cockpit . it may be too early to draw conclusive lessons from what has happened , but as this unfolds and before we begin constructing a narrative about the pilot that may be filled with rumors , innuendo and __half-truths__ , there are structural issues to address immediately . first , we have seen that there is a real risk of pilots bringing down planes . we have built no back-up plans into the secure cockpit programs . it might be necessary to devise secure and classified entry access passwords or electronic keys that are available only to both pilots or a pilot and the lead flight attendant . no system of security should rely on a single point of entry and while the post-9 / 11 security planning made sense then , it may have outlived the threat now . second , regardless of pilots ' backgrounds and ideologies , airlines as sophisticated as lufthansa may need to implement more than voluntary __stress-relief__ assessments . the zeitgeist of pilots is very similar to the military : tough , strong , with psychological challenges viewed as `` sissy . '' perhaps airlines will need to guarantee that pilots who seek counseling will not be unjustly punished . and instead of sitting back and waiting for someone to approach counselors , regular and consistent check-ins might be necessary . finally , the `` t '' word . before the news today , the obama administration quickly rejected a notion that this was terrorism . and that may still be accurate . but as someone who has been a part of counterterrorism efforts , i am impressed with the french prosecutor 's honesty in a search for the right words . this is obviously terrorism in the general sense to elicit fear in a general population , but whether it was done for some political or ideological reason -lrb- in the absence of any group taking credit , it does not fit the model of most major airline terror attacks -rrb- we still do not know . and it is n't as if there is a national response that we can expect from germany , such as going to war . still , it clearly is n't just suicide . this is different . if there is some nefarious ideological motivation , this may be one of a few incidents where a `` loner '' is able to create massive , simultaneous deaths . most lone wolf terror is almost always of low consequence . it may be that we are in an era when we do n't have the right words to describe the threats we face from __loners__ with the capacity for mass casualties . as lufthansa ceo __carsten__ __spohr__ said , `` if a person kills himself and also 149 other people , another word should be used -- not suicide . '' and that honest assessment is what we heard today .

'' even at miami international airport , gannon said , `` they still ca n't 100 % say that they can keep contraband or any type of item out of their restricted area .

ARTICEL:     washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- no deal is better than a bad deal , say critics of president barack obama 's nuclear talks with iran . but what if republican and democratic opponents succeed in their intensifying effort to derail the diplomacy ? the price of failure could be an ugly blame game and cascade of political reprisals leading to nuclear chicken between iran and the west -- potentially leading to war . `` we would have to deal with a resumption of iran 's nuclear activities , which we do n't want to see take place . iran would have to deal with the resumption of sanctions , which they do n't want , '' said gary __samore__ , a top nonproliferation official during obama 's first term . for now , the grave consequences of a breakdown in talks are one reason the united states and iran are still at the table , as a grueling diplomatic process reaches critical deadlines and painful political decisions __beckon__ . iran deal : a treaty or not a treaty , that is the question . secretary of state john kerry and iranian foreign minister javad zarif are haggling over the remaining issues in lausanne , switzerland , ahead of an __end-of-the-month__ deadline for a framework agreement , which then must be finalized by july 1 . but time may be running out for a deal in which six world powers would lift sanctions that have throttled iran 's economy in return for assurances that tehran will continue to stay a year or so away from developing a nuclear bomb . the white house puts the chances of a deal at only 50-50 : disputes still rage over the scale of nuclear infrastructure iran will be allowed to keep , the pace of sanctions relief and the extent of nuclear site inspections . despite the controversy stoked last week in washington when 47 gop senators sent a letter to iran 's leaders warning that the future of a deal was not guaranteed , many analysts believe that the talks will go on , even if the __end-of-march__ deadline slips . `` not because all sides are desperate to keep talking . but i think sufficient momentum has been created in the last month or so that they see real possibilities , '' said robert __einhorn__ , a former senior u.s. state department arms control official . obama may now have slightly more political leeway on the talks than before -- ironically because of attempts by u.s. and israeli critics to pen him in . a few weeks ago , skeptical democrats appeared to be lining up with republicans and approaching a __veto-proof__ senate majority that could have forced obama to submit a deal to congress or accept the passage of new sanctions . either move could have killed the agreement . but the republicans ' letter and a fiercely critical speech to congress by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on the proposed deal prompted some skeptical democrats to close ranks , at least temporarily . but senate republican majority leader mitch mcconnell told cnn 's dana bash on `` state of the union '' that obama was on the cusp of agreeing a `` very bad '' deal that would allow iran to keep its nuclear infrastructure intact . he said that if an agreement is reached , he would bring up legislation that would give congress 60 days to back or reject a deal , despite fresh pleas from the white house for the gop to hold off . if no deal is reached , mcconnell said on sunday that he would press ahead with toughening sanctions on iran , he said . republican sources , meanwhile , said that despite the furor over the letter from the senators , no democrats had yet formally pulled support for legislation requiring the senate to have a say on the deal . that leaves the real possibility of a pitched political showdown on iran in the coming months . the opening for diplomacy is meanwhile not endless . and if no deal emerges by july , political pressure for a tougher administration stance towards iran may be unstoppable . if diplomacy fails , how events unfold will be dictated by how the process collapses ; who gets the blame ; and the political pressures exerted on obama and iranian president hassan rouhani in washington and tehran . `` if , at the end of june , there is not a deal , and talks have broken off , i think that it is inevitable that the congress will adopt new sanctions legislation , '' said __einhorn__ , now with the brookings institution . `` what that will mean is the iranians will __reciprocate__ . '' iran could start up centrifuges halted during the nuclear negotiations , bring more advanced machinery online and enrich uranium to the potent 20 % level that would get it closer to a weapon . and if it bars international inspectors , the world would have no idea how far iran is from making a bomb . what 's in the iran nuclear deal . the administration thinks that if the united states gets the blame for using __hardball__ tactics that derail talks -- if , say , congress imposes more sanctions , as administration critics want -- there is no way its international partners would keep existing sanctions in place , let alone double down and impose new ones . in addition to unilateral u.s. sanctions congress has imposed , the united nations , european union and other countries have put in place their own sanctions cutting off iran from international partners and not just the american economy . cornelius __adebahr__ , a european security specialist at the carnegie endowment for international peace , predicted iran would reap a propaganda victory . `` it would give ammunition for iran to say the u.s. is not reliable , '' he said . massachusetts institute of technology 's jim walsh , a specialist on the talks , said the iranian government would have little choice but to hit back at a tougher u.s. stance . `` the iranians are just not going to take it . they are going to feel condemned to respond . both sides will take their shovels and dig the holes deeper . '' walsh continued , `` we would be between a lame duck -lrb- u.s. -rrb- president for whom negotiations had just failed , a weakened rouhani , for whom negotiations have just failed , and a coming u.s. presidential election -- not exactly the best environment to return to talks and accomplish a diplomatic settlement . '' aborted negotiations that leave iran __rededicated__ to its nuclear program raise the specter of tehran with a bomb -- or some enemy country taking military action to stop it . did 47 republican senators break the law in plain sight ? but critics of the deal being worked out in switzerland do n't agree that such an outcome is the __likeliest__ scenario . gop hawks and israel believe tehran is so desperate for sanctions relief , especially at a time of low oil prices , that it will have no choice but to offer a better deal than the one currently on the table and agree to the complete halt to uranium enrichment that israel and conservatives demand . `` if iran threatens to walk away from the table -- and this often happens in a persian bazaar -- call their bluff . they 'll be back , because they need the deal a lot more than you do , '' netanyahu maintained in his congress speech . former republican presidential nominee mitt romney made the case in a usa today op-ed friday that obama should `` walk away from a flimsy nuclear agreement . '' those opposed to the deal reject the administration that follow their advice would likely blow up the talks and set washington on an inevitable path to war as the only remaining way to disable iran 's nuclear infrastructure . instead , gop congressmen counter that several bills they are pushing , with significant democratic support , do not __forestall__ the possibility of continued diplomacy if talks fail . they say that extra sanctions would increase obama 's leverage in diplomacy , not weaken it . even if talks do succeed this year , the long-term future of an agreement still would n't be assured . the diplomatic effort has powerful critics among hardliners in tehran who , whatever 's written on paper , could push to __illicitly__ expand iran 's nuclear program and close in on a bomb . it 's not just republicans who fear tehran may violate any deal or test the limits of compliance . some people who back the talks admit that may be the case , too . in washington , congress will be required to lift the existing sanctions on iran to sustain the agreement in years to come -- a step that is hardly a given . and the stiff republican opposition means a deal is not assured of surviving the arrival of a new president in the white house come 2017 . a future republican president could reverse obama 's sanctions waivers fairly quickly , as the senators warned in their letter to iran . whether the new president would want to do so is another matter , however , especially if iran lives up to the terms of a deal , which would include stringent verification by international inspectors . he or she would risk a heavy political price . a unilateral washington pullout would likely infuriate u.s. partners and leave the rookie president facing a boiling crisis that could overwhelm the new administration 's nascent foreign policy . `` that 's what the administration is counting on -- if there is compliance and the deal is working well , '' said __einhorn__ . kerry reminded congress this week that britain , france , germany , china and russia would all be __cosignatories__ of a deal . `` if all those countries have said this is good and it 's working , -lrb- will a new president -rrb- just turn around and nullify it on behalf of the united states ? '' he asked . `` that 's not going to happen . '' congress would face the same __cost-benefit__ calculation when it comes to the sanctions only lawmakers can __expunge__ . in the event of a democratic white house victory in 2016 , the congressional math could also change in favor of a deal . and if republicans keep their majorities , lawmakers who are bent on thwarting obama may be less willing to handcuff a new gop president .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- __creflo__ dollar 's new scheme to raise $ 60 million to purchase a luxury gulfstream __g650__ airplane is the latest chapter in a long and sordid history of __televangelists__ exploiting their churches ' tax-exempt status -- and their congregants -- to line their own pockets . preaching the word of faith , or `` prosperity gospel , '' and capitalizing on lax government oversight of his church 's finances has enriched dollar and his family to the detriment of his followers and the american taxpayer . world __changers__ church international , dollar 's __30,000-member__ church , is a tax-exempt organization under the internal revenue code . that means the church 's donors receive a tax exemption for their donations -lrb- including for dollar 's new jet ambitions -rrb- , and the church pays no tax on the revenue . what 's more , because it is organized as a church , the federal government does not require world __changers__ to file a publicly available tax return , as other nonprofit organizations are required to do . those tax returns provide at least some financial information to donors and the public about the organization , including its revenues , assets , expenditures and executive compensation . dollar is known for his custom suits , luxury homes and private jets that ferry him , among other places , from his home base in college park , georgia , to his satellite church in manhattan , where he and his wife reportedly have a $ 2.5 million apartment . for dollar , though , these excesses are n't __embarrassments__ . instead , they are proof that his theology works , that god __blesses__ the faithful with abundant riches . dollar tells his congregants to `` sow a seed '' with him , promising that a plentiful harvest will be their own blessing and , essentially , a return on their investment . to promoters of the word of faith , or prosperity gospel , `` sowing a seed '' with your pastor is required for god 's blessing , even if you 're taking it out of your rent money or the last remaining cash in your wallet . many christians find word of faith a __heretical__ theology , an embarrassing distortion of jesus ' teachings , not to mention a fraud on congregants . while the government can not constitutionally mediate theological disputes or otherwise interfere in a church 's internal affairs , it can use its oversight powers to ensure that preachers who use their __pulpits__ for profit do n't exploit the tax advantages afforded to ordinary houses of worship to pursue their legitimate charitable purposes . in 2007 , the senate finance committee , under the chairmanship of iowa republican sen. charles grassley , launched an investigation into the financial practices of six __televangelists__ , including dollar . the committee requested documents from dollar and his wife , __taffi__ , explaining that taxpayers `` should be assured that their donations are being used for the tax exempt purposes of the organizations . '' the documents sought by the committee included audited financial statements for world __changers__ , information about related for-profit and nonprofit entities , and data on executive compensation and the church 's real and personal assets . more than three years later , after an outcry from the __televangelists__ , most visibly dollar 's mentor kenneth copeland , the committee opted to abandon its efforts to instigate any sort of regulatory changes . instead , the committee called on the ministries to engage in `` __self-reform__ , '' even though the committee staff 's findings plainly demonstrated that four of the ministries , including dollar 's , were unwilling to engage in any sort of meaningful transparency or accountability . of the six __televangelists__ from whom the committee sought financial data , dollar was deemed the `` least cooperative . '' without dollar 's cooperation , the committee was left to piece together a puzzle about his finances through public documents , third parties and news reports . it concluded that in 2006 , world __changers__ had received $ 69 million in contributions at its atlanta church alone , that the dollars owned two multimillion-dollar homes in georgia , and that the church and related business entities had at various points owned four aircraft flown for personal use -- although none was nearly as pricey as the luxury gulfstream dollar now seeks to acquire . the committee staff was clearly troubled by the array of business entities , `` including private airports and aircraft leasing companies , '' that raised red flags `` about the use of the church 's tax-exempt status to avoid taxation . '' precisely because of dollar 's lack of cooperation , the staff concluded , `` we are unable to determine whether and the extent to which they are reporting and paying taxes on income earned in those entities . '' dollar is now looking to raise $ 60 million for this new aircraft , purportedly `` to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the lord jesus christ . '' four years after the abandonment of the senate finance committee 's __televangelist__ investigation , it looks like the absence of government oversight has only emboldened __creflo__ dollar .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     sarah __posner__ : __televangelist__ __creflo__ dollar asking congregants to help finance a $ 65 million gulfstream __g650__ . she says government should oversee tax-exempt churches that essentially operate as for-profit enterprises . __posner__ : senate committee took up this issue but dropped it ; this seems to have emboldened dollar .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- a salary dispute between north and south korea has sent jitters through factory owners operating at an industrial complex that is supposed to be a symbol of cooperation for the divided korean peninsula . the disagreement started in late february , when the north korean government demanded an increase of around $ __8.60__ a month for north korean employees working in the kaesong industrial complex . south korea is working on a response to the demands , leaving factory owners worried about the threat of a factory shutdown . `` i 'm already nervous about the situation because of the traumatic experience in 2013 when the north closed down the complex , '' said yoo __chang-geun__ , the south korean head of an automobile parts manufacturer that employs 400 north koreans in kaesong . yoo 's company , __sj__ tech , operates out of kaesong , which is just north of the demilitarized zone in north korean territory . he was referring to north korea 's __monthslong__ closure of kaesong in 2013 , during a period of heightened tension on the peninsula . about 125 south korean companies operate out of kaesong , employing more than 50,000 north korean workers . an official from the south korean government 's unification ministry , who according to policy spoke to cnn on condition of anonymity , says companies at kaesong pay their north korean workers an average of $ __155.50__ a month . north korea is demanding an increase of roughly 5.5 % , to an equivalent $ __164.10__ a month . the south korean government argues that the salary hike is a breach of an existing agreement for the industrial park , which first opened in 2004 . the official called the north 's request a `` one-sided demand . '' the official did not rule out the possibility that penalties could be imposed on south korean companies if they individually agree to raise employee salaries . manufacturers in kaesong rely on the government in seoul to represent them in negotiations with pyongyang . `` it feels like we 're entering a very difficult phase where innocent corporations are being beaten up by political fights between the north and south , '' kim __seo-jin__ , the director of corporate association of the kaesong industrial complex , said wednesday . experts say this is n't the first time the north and south have __butted__ heads over employee salaries in kaesong . the industrial park was established as a symbol of cooperation at a time when a previous government in south korea was pursuing a `` sunshine policy '' of friendship with its northern rival . south korean companies benefited from the extremely low cost of north korean labor . meanwhile , north korea gained a valuable stream of hard currency revenue by __appropriating__ an undisclosed amount of salary from its citizens working in kaesong . south korean employers also made a practice of giving small food bonuses to some hungry employees . for a time , this came in the form of `` __choco__ pies , '' a packaged south korean dessert . the snacks reportedly became __highly-prized__ items on the black market in the communist north 's __rigidly__ controlled economy . eventually , employers transitioned to giving workers instant noodles , as one former kaesong factory owner told cnn in 2014 , `` in order to provide a more substantial snack . '' `` the whole project is built with an understanding that north korean wages should and will continue to rise , '' says john __delury__ , associate professor at __yonsei__ university 's graduate school of international studies in seoul . but one factory owner said the communist regime 's most recent approach to the salaries is problematic . `` the amount of the pay raise demanded this time is small , '' said __sj__ tech 's yoo __chang-geun__ . `` but having this kind of precedent may lead to losing control of the operation in the complex . '' experts say seoul and pyongyang 's approach to the kaesong salary dispute will serve as an important barometer for the direction of future relations between the rival governments . `` kaesong is the last living legacy of the sunshine policy , '' says professor __delury__ of __yeonsei__ university . `` if something like wage disputes lead to the shutdown or freezing of kaesong , that would be a major blow .

'' the brief marks the first time the administration has formally made a filing with the high court supporting its position that bans on gay marriage should be declared unconstitutional nationwide . the court will hear arguments in the state cases on april 28 . __verrilli__ said the laws `` impose concrete harms on same-sex couples and send the inescapable message that same-sex couples and their children are second-class families , unworthy of the recognition and benefits that __opposite-sex__ couples take for granted . '' the bans , he said , `` can not be reconciled with the fundamental constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws . '' he said there is `` no adequate justification for such a discriminatory and __injurious__ exercise of state control . '' __verrilli__ stressed that throughout history lesbian and gay people have encountered numerous barriers that have `` prevented them from full , free , and equal participation in american life . '' in an op-ed earlier this week , published in usa today , attorney general eric holder wrote , `` marriage equality is an idea whose time has come . '' president barack obama 's position on same-sex marriage has evolved . in may 2012 , in an interview with abc news , he announced his support for gay marriage . `` at a certain point , '' he said , `` i 've just concluded that for me , personally , it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same-sex couples should be able to get married . '' at his 2013 inauguration he said , `` our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law . '' in february 2013 , the administration filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of couples challenging california 's ban on same sex marriage . __verilli__ argued that california law provided same sex couples registered as domestic partners all the legal incidents of marriage , but denied them the `` designation of marriage . '' ultimately , the supreme court dismissed that case . supporters of the state bans have until the end of the month to file their briefs . thursday was the deadline for briefs in support of petitioners . james __obergefell__ , the named plaintiff in the case , came to the court friday as the human rights campaign delivered a brief signed by over 200,000 individuals in support of same-sex marriage . in an interview , __obergefell__ said his journey began when he challenged ohio 's refusal to recognize same-sex marriage on death certificates . he was legally married to his partner , john arthur james , in maryland in 2013 , but after arthur died , ohio officials refused to recognize __obergefell__ as his spouse . asked what it would mean to him if his side wins , __obergefell__ said , '' it will mean john and i matter . it will mean we have the same rights and responsibilities as other americans .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- starbucks charges more than $ 5 for a large -lrb- `` __venti__ '' in starbucks speak -rrb- caramel __frappuccino__ , yet no one bats an eye . but when the ceo of starbucks announced a plan he hoped would ease racial tensions , the response was immediate outrage ! this latest controversy started monday when starbucks ceo howard schultz unveiled a new initiative in which starbucks baristas would write the words `` race together '' on coffee cups to help spark a dialogue on race . schultz even took out full-page ads in the new york times and usa today touting this effort . twitter immediately lit up with a flurry of angry tweets -- apparently from people who have consumed far too much caffeine . surprisingly , though , the backlash came from all sides . one self-described conservative tweeted this : . a person who noted her support of progressive causes in her twitter profile tweeted : . even people in the middle expressed scorn with tweets such as : . i , on the other hand , applaud schultz 's efforts , at least in theory . as schultz correctly stated when discussing the genesis for `` race together , '' `` if we just keep going about our business ... and ignoring this -lrb- racial issue -rrb- , then i think we are , in a sense , part of the problem . '' sure , i also see some logistical problems with the `` get your iced __mocha__ __frappuccino__ with a shot of racial tolerance '' approach . first , i live in new york city , where new yorkers barely have the patience to wait for a cup of plain old coffee to be poured let alone stand in line longer while people engage in a nuanced discourse on race . i can envision awkward situations where the baristas ask a customer , `` so how do you want your coffee ? '' to which the customer responds , `` black . '' for some reason saying `` black '' in the context of this program could feel uncomfortable . next thing you know , starbucks will have to coin politically correct terms for `` black '' coffee . and as a practical matter , only 40 % of starbucks employees are minorities . consequently , in most starbucks , the conversation about racial tolerance will between be between two white people . but let 's put those issues aside . the swift and angry backlash against schultz 's idea proves once again that not only do n't we live in a __post-racial__ america , we live in a __hyper-racial__ one . in fact , a recent cnn/orc poll found 40 % of americans believe racial relations have become worse during the six years barack obama has been in the white house . it 's strikingly obvious that if we are going to improve this situation , we need to have a candid and brutally honest discussion about the underlying factors contributing to racism , the lack of empathy for people of other races , etc. . and that 's simply what starbucks ' `` race together '' stated goal is : `` to stimulate conversation , compassion and positive action regarding race in america . '' starbucks ' senior vice president of communications , corey __dubrowa__ , deleted his twitter account monday after `` feeling personally attacked in a cascade of negativity '' and being `` overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion '' in response to `` race together . '' but __dubrowa__ was back on twitter on tuesday night . why ? because he truly believed in `` the power of meaningful , civil , thoughtful , respectful open conversation . '' __dubrowa__ 's reaction may just be a __teachable__ moment on discussing race . it 's truly not an easy topic to __broach__ . the initial response by some , like __dubrowa__ , may be to shut down when racial discussions become uncomfortable . but then , hopefully like __dubrowa__ did later , the conversation can be rejoined within a framework that 's respectful to all involved . but to be blunt , one of the biggest obstacles in even starting this conversation is that most white americans do n't want to discuss race , as polls have confirmed . for example , after the grand jury in ferguson , missouri , did n't indict police officer darren wilson in the killing of teenager michael brown , a poll found that 80 % of blacks felt that the shooting raised important issues about race that needed to be discussed . how many white people agreed ? only 37 % . and personally i have seen some white friends become defensive when race issues are raised . why ? because many view it as an accusation that they are somehow racist -lrb- or at least complicit in racism -rrb- as opposed to a starting point for a productive conversation . the question is how can we begin that talk about race that our nation desperately needs to have ? true , the line at starbucks might not be the best place . but it has to start somewhere if we are going to close the racial gap that many , including myself , feel is growing .

'' to find answers to this age-old question about martian water molecules , scientists used the world 's three major infrared telescopes , in chile and hawaii , to measure traces of water in the planet 's atmosphere over a range of areas and seasons , spanning from march 2008 to january 2014 . `` from the ground , we could take a snapshot of the whole hemisphere on a single night , '' said goddard 's michael __mumma__ . scientists looked at the ratio of two different forms -- or isotopes -- of water , __h2o__ and __hdo__ . the latter is made heavier by one of its hydrogen atoms , called __deuterium__ , which has a neutron at its core in addition to the proton that all hydrogen atoms have . that weighed down __hdo__ more , while larger amounts of hydrogen from __h2o__ floated into the atmosphere , broke away from mars ' low gravity and disappeared into space . as a result , water trapped in mars ' polar ice caps has a much higher level of __hdo__ than fluid water on earth does , the scientists said . the scientists compared the ratio of __h2o__ to __hdo__ in mars ' atmosphere today to the ratio of the two molecules trapped inside a mars meteorite , a stone that broke off from mars -- perhaps when an asteroid hit -- and landed on earth some 4.5 billion years ago . they were able to determine how much that ratio had changed over time and estimate how much water has disappeared from mars -- about 87 % . the findings indicate that the red planet could have had its fair share of blue waters , possibly even yielding an ocean . according to nasa , there might have been enough water to cover up to 20 % of mars ' surface . that would amount to an ocean __proportionally__ larger than the atlantic on earth . `` this ocean had a maximum depth of around 5,000 feet or around one mile deep , '' said villanueva . nasa scientists say that much of this water loss happened over billions of years , along with a loss of atmosphere . and as the planet 's atmospheric pressure dropped , it was harder for water to stay in liquid form . heat also contributed to its evaporation . as a result , the remaining __primeval__ ocean water continued to move toward the poles , where it eventually froze . `` with mars losing that much water , the planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought , suggesting it might have been habitable for longer , '' said __mumma__ . cnn 's ben brumfield contributed to this report .

'' the 31-year-old south african comic has made only a few appearances on that show since popping up as a correspondent in december , but he 's better known within the world of standup comedy . in 2013 , noah became the first african comedian to perform on `` the tonight show with jay leno . '' he 's been on the cover of rolling stone in south africa , where he 's extremely popular . he 's joked about being the son of a black african woman and a white swiss man who met when interracial relationships were illegal in south africa . `` my mom would be arrested . she would be fined , and still she was like ` ooh , i do n't care , i want a white man , ooh , ' '' he once told an audience at london 's soho theater during his standup show `` the racist . '' `` and my dad was also like , well , you know how the swiss love chocolate . '' why mixed-race comic was ` born a crime ' race , identity and ethnicity have figured in prominently in his act . because of his parents ' __then-illegal__ relationship , he joked , `` in the streets , my father could n't walk with us . he would walk on the other side of the road and wave at me like a creepy pedophile . and my mom could walk with me , but every time the police went by , she would drop me . i felt like a bag of weed . '' noah has said in his act that he lost touch with his father for several years because of apartheid . in 2012 , he told npr that he was fascinated by how americans discuss race . `` i got to baltimore , and i was expecting ... because urban means built up and new , you know , '' he said . `` so i got there , and i was , ` whoa , it 's not as urban as people told me . ' ... but it 's very black . i 'll tell you that much . '' noah told cnn 's `` african voices '' in 2013 that after finding success in his homeland -- where he starred on a soap opera , hosted his own radio show and was the subject of the 2012 documentary `` you laugh but it 's true '' -- he moved to the united states for a year to try to raise his profile . he returned to his country with new material shaped by his time spent in the states , he said . `` comedy is really getting quite popular in south africa , '' noah said . `` it 's moving from the bastard child of entertainment into the mainstream , which is very good . i think the reason it 's doing so well is because south africans need to laugh and south africans want to laugh . '' noah has moved to the u.s. permanently and told newsweek , `` i 've always wanted to be a comedian in the world . i do n't want to be labeled a south african comedian . '' on `` the daily show , '' he debuted as a correspondent with a bit titled `` spot the africa , '' which juxtaposed modern-day south africa and the united states . what remains to be seen is whether what the guardian has described as `` his combination of terribly polite , __butter-wouldn__ ` __t-melt__ stage presence and biting , often brutal gags '' will translate into success on `` the daily show .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the desert and __dun-colored__ cliffs around the town of __tataouine__ were once the backdrop for the movie `` star wars , '' much of which was filmed in this neglected corner of tunisia in 1976 . this struggling town on the fringes of the sahara still draws a few fans of the movie but now finds itself part of a real conflict , as a __way-station__ for jihadists crossing the libyan border 60 miles to the east . earlier this month , before the gun attack on the __bardo__ museum in tunis , three young men were arrested here as they allegedly made plans to cross into libya to join a terrorist network . a local official told cnn they had since been taken to tunis for questioning . two arms caches have also been found in the region this month , one of which included rocket-propelled grenade launchers and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition , thought to have been removed from a libyan armory in the aftermath of moammar gadhafi 's ouster in 2011 . driving near the border , it 's quickly obvious why the tunisian government is so anxious about libya 's implosion and the emergence there of an isis affiliate whose tentacles stretch half-way across the country . this open space is vast and sparsely populated . smugglers ' tracks __criss-cross__ the endless scrub and steep , arid hills that run along the border . gasoline , drugs and other contraband have long been smuggled across the frontier . near the town of __remada__ , south of __tataouine__ , a couple of soldiers manned a checkpoint . they wore protective jackets -- whether for show or because of the perceived threat from islamist militants , it 's hard to know . when we arrived , passports were requested and phone calls made . we were escorted into the town and politely but firmly told we could go no further without written authorization . exactly four years ago we had passed through __remada__ unchallenged . tunisians had just launched the arab spring . there was a mood of heady optimism and the security apparatus of the ben ali regime had melted away . but already libya was falling apart , as different groups of rebels fought to oust gadhafi . thousands of foreign workers were then trying to escape the violence through the few official border crossings . now libya 's descent into chaos means those crossings are sometimes closed , and it 's foreign fighters using the smugglers ' trails that tunisia must worry about . at the national guard building in __remada__ the officer in charge -- a burly figure in his __mid-40s__ - was wearing a `` new york 1999 '' sweatshirt and appeared to be one of many plainclothes security personnel in the town . he was happy to talk but did n't want his name reported . ignoring calls on his cell phone , he lamented the state of the arab world and the expansion of daesh , as isis is frequently called . look at iraq , syria , libya ... of course tunisia is threatened , he said . the tunisians are doing what they can , he said . there is now a __1.8-mile__ no-go zone inside the border , and the military has built fortified positions every couple of miles . the security presence has been boosted seven - to __ten-fold__ , but even so there were n't enough men or equipment . the border , after all , is 380 miles long . a much wider buffer zone -- 12 miles deep -- has also been created , which people can only enter with permission . this has not gone down well with local herders whose goats and sheep live off the desert scrub . other measures taken by the tunisian authorities , according to the official in __remada__ , include a ban on men aged __18-35__ from going to libya unless they have residence papers and proof of employment there . another source said the ban applied to men under 30 . even so the two gunmen who stormed into the __bardo__ museum last week -- both of them in their twenties -- had been able to cross __illicitly__ into libya in december , according to tunisian state security minister rafik __chelly__ . __chelly__ told a tunisian network that the pair had received weapons training in the isis stronghold of __derna__ . the mood among many tunisians seems much harder and more pragmatic than it was four years ago . a shopkeeper in a small village between __tataouine__ and __remada__ said there needs to be a security crackdown . he said people in the area led simple lives -- but they knew each other and noticed strangers . __bassim__ , a taxi driver on the island of __djerba__ , some 60 miles to the north of __tataouine__ , was of a similar view . `` the people need to be the third eye of the security forces '' he said . `` and we need to think of the safety of visitors like we think of the safety of our families . '' __bassim__ and hundreds of thousands of other tunisians have reason to be worried . they rely on tourism to make a living , and fear that isis will -- as it has threatened -- launch further attacks against foreigners visiting libya . __bassim__ ferries tourists around __djerba__ , whose luxury hotels and beaches are a popular destination for french and german tourists . it took the tourist industry years to recover from a terror attack on a synagogue on the island in 2002 in which 21 people were killed . __bassim__ says he 's heard all too many horror stories about events in libya from the oil workers he took to __djerba__ 's airport . others , mainly in the capital tunis , are apprehensive that the democratic gains of four years ago may be eroded or lost in a new security clampdown . they point to new anti-terrorism legislation that strengthens detention powers and the right of the authorities to monitor suspects ' phones and social media . the measure was being discussed in parliament wednesday when the attack was launched on the adjacent museum . tunisians say their country is at a crossroads as it tries to fend off the jihadist contagion seeping across north africa . their democracy is young and vulnerable . `` we want to be the hope of the arab world , '' said __bassim__ , `` like we were four years ago . '' `` we still have hope , but now we have fear too . ''

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- there have been a few times in my career when i 've been thoroughly disappointed -- even disgusted -- with my fellow women in the workplace . no , i certainly do n't expect all my female colleagues to go out of their way for me and sing `` __kumbaya__ '' together in the office , but i 'm always stunned when a woman who could have been helpful to me was n't , when a woman who could have been a mentor chose not to be , when a woman tried to hurt me because of her own fear , anxiety or what have you . i 'd love to say more about each of the women i 've met along the way who fit those descriptions , but my point is not to single anyone out . my goal is to ask the question , `` why ? '' obviously , not all women are like this and there are plenty of men guilty of the same behavior , but why do so many women try to tear each other down instead of lift each other up ? i figured this would be a perfect question for sophia nelson , author of a new self-help book for women called `` the woman code , '' and she did n't disappoint . unlocking ` the woman code ' : 4 tips to know your value . `` from the time we 're little girls , we 're taught to compete , '' said nelson during a recent conversation at cnn . `` i need to be prettier , taller , smarter , my hair needs to be __straighter__ , __curlier__ , whatever it is . i need to get the better looking guy . i need to always be better than because we 're taught to come from a place of lack as women . '' the way nelson , an award-winning author and journalist , radio and television personality and motivational speaker , sees it , we women need to start operating like the boys . men `` operate from a sense of , there 's this whole pie , and i want my piece , and i do n't care if he gets his piece , and maybe we even have to work together to start that business , start that company , '' said nelson . of course , it 's easier for a man not to worry `` if he gets his piece '' since there are plenty of pieces of pie available for men in terms of management positions in corporate america , but that is n't the case for women . today , just 5 % of s&p 500 chief executives are women and only 14 % of the top five senior leadership positions at those companies are held by women , according to a cnn money analysis . sheryl sandberg teams up with nba to get men to __#leanin__ . decades ago , the situation was even worse . when i was just starting my television news career in 1990 , women who were in their 40s and were in high-level positions were the only women in a position of influence . naturally , many of them often viewed other women as threats who could take their job . `` because they did n't think there could be ten of them , they only thought there could be one of them , '' said nelson . `` fast forward 20 years later . now there ... are a number of women partners at big firms , a number of women in congress . i could keep going on and on so ... there is a place for more of us . '' which means we can lift as we climb , we can help our younger sisters and even our cohorts while still moving up and on in our careers , says nelson . `` how exactly do we do that ? '' i had to ask . nelson came armed with five tips on how women can work with as opposed to against each other . first , nelson says be mindful of the people you surround yourself with and careful about `` who 's in your row . '' `` if you hear another woman say , and i 've heard this , ' i do n't do women friends , i do n't have women friends , ' believe her and leave her alone . i mean that , listen to me now , '' said nelson . there are too many women who believe in the sisterhood of women , so do n't invest any time , if possible , with people who do n't , she says . if you are in a meeting and you have a great idea , do n't feel like you have to hoard it to yourself , said nelson . `` collaborate , share , collaborate . ... so you lift other women as you climb by collaborating versus competing . '' competition is healthy and we can compete , but we ought to take a page from our male colleagues ' playbook , she said . `` the guys collaborate better than we do because they operate from a place of ' i want the dollars . i want to win the contract . i want to get the business . ' we have to get in that same mindset . '' we 're all busy but we 've got to slow down and mentor , said nelson . `` we have to build a bench , '' she said . `` men do this well again . you 've seen it in corporate , i 've seen it . the guys go out and golf . they do things together and they 're building up the next young man leader . whatever field we 're in ... we 're less likely to do it because we 're busy . we 've got to mentor . '' when you lift other women as you climb , said nelson , you realize it 's reciprocal . `` it 's not all about you . '' we women win when more women are in executive roles in organizations , i added . `` the right women , '' said nelson . `` i want to caveat that . and again , i do n't mean to be mean or __catty__ but ... i know a lot of women in power positions that do n't help other women but there are a lot of women in power positions that do . '' this is a tough one for us , says nelson . we need to be willing to say to another woman that we did n't like something she did or said and do it in a respectful and private way where we are still building her up , not pulling her down . `` do n't go tell 10 of your friends not to like her . you 'd be amazed at how silly we can be . we 're still in kindergarten some of us , '' said nelson . `` gossip is still one of the most rampant , nasty things we do as women to each other . and it hurts . it really damages women . '' why do you think women too often tear each other down instead of help each other in the workplace ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter __@kellywallacetv__ or cnn living on facebook .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- when vladimir putin __reappears__ , he does it with style -- and an __in-your-face__ attitude . the russian president attended a large concert in moscow 's red square on wednesday to commemorate the first anniversary of his country 's annexation of the ukrainian territory of crimea , an act condemned by many in the international community as illegal . only putin does n't call it annexation . he calls it reunification . according to the presidential website , putin attended the `` we 're together ! '' concert and meeting `` celebrating the first anniversary of crimea and sevastopol 's reunification with russia . '' the peninsula became part of the soviet union in 1917 , following the russian revolution . but in 1991 , following the breakup of the soviet union , it became part of a newly independent ukraine . on march 16 , 2014 , crimea held a referendum on whether to continue as part of ukraine or to cast its lot with the russian federation . the result was overwhelming , at least among those voting : 95 % said they wanted to become part of russia . a mere two days later , russia annexed the territory . putin said later that he had been planning the move even before the referendum was held . `` friends ! '' the president said in red square on wednesday , according to his website , `` exactly one year ago , russia , which we are speaking of so much right now , and the russian people showed amazing togetherness and patriotism in supporting the aspirations of the people of crimea and sevastopol to return to their native shores . '' the issue , he said , was `` our history , our spirituality and our statehood , the things that make us a single people and single united nation . '' also participating , the website said , were `` popular russian music groups and singers . '' putin was recently out of sight without explanation for 10 days , during which time various meetings were canceled . he reappeared only monday . lest anyone doubt he was still in charge , putin , who prides himself on his fitness , has been displaying a different form of muscle this week -- the military kind . he mobilized russia 's entire northern fleet in a military exercise that reportedly ranks among the largest since the breakup of the soviet union . nato reported that , on tuesday , estonian radar detected an unspecified number of aircraft over the baltic sea . nato sent jets to identify the planes and later reported that `` the russian military aircraft '' flew on into the airspace of the russian __exclave__ of __kaliningrad__ .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- what 's your company doing this year for march madness ? if your workplace is like most , the answer is a big fat nothing . instead of leveraging the ncaa 's annual tournament and turning it into a genuine bonding experience between colleagues , most organizations pretend it is n't happening . on the surface , ignoring a sporting event that takes place during regular work hours might appear like sound business practice . after all , companies need to generate profit , and it 's hard to generate profit when your employees are huddled around a television , right ? wrong . what this perspective overlooks is that productivity is n't simply a function of how many hours we spend at the office . it also depends on the quality of our workplace experience . and one critical feature of that experience is how closely connected we feel to our colleagues . research has consistently demonstrated that we are more effective at our jobs when we feel attached to the people around us . how do strong colleague relationships elevate our performance ? for one thing , they make us more motivated . when you and your colleagues are close , failing to perform your duties generates more than a dissatisfied customer or an unhappy manager -- it means letting down your friends . the social pressure to achieve results can serve as a stronger motivator than anything a boss can say . closer connections also foster a sense of trust and more candid dialogue . studies comparing the collaboration patterns of friends to mere acquaintances indicate that friends are more willing to ask for help and more comfortable speaking up when a colleague is off on the wrong track . performance aside , workplace friendships benefit organizations for another reason : employees with richer friendships tend to stay on with their company for longer periods of time . despite these considerable benefits , at most companies , friendships are an afterthought . to motivate employees , managers tend to rely on bonuses , promotions , and salary increases , ignoring the fact that as humans , we all have a basic psychological need for meaningful relationships . yet the research is clear : when we feel valued and respected by those around us , we 're not only more motivated -- we 're also happier , healthier , and more productive . for too many organizations , investing in quality employee relationships means one thing : __team-building__ exercises . think ice breakers , trust falls and scavenger hunts . every year , corporations spend millions on off-site retreats and weekend getaways packed with cringeworthy activities that purportedly foster better communication . but here 's the truth : while awkward collaborations may spark brief experiences of closeness , they rarely translate into lasting friendships . so what does ? studies suggest three factors are essential to the development of authentic , meaningful friendships : familiarity -lrb- being around the same colleague often -rrb- , similarity -lrb- finding __commonalities__ in your background -rrb- , and __self-disclosure__ -lrb- revealing personal information about yourself every now and then , and having your co-worker do the same -rrb- . few activities include all three of these elements . this explains why close relationships usually take years to develop . but interestingly , office __game-viewing__ parties come close . they present opportunities for colleagues to mingle with those from other departments and connect over shared interests . for many , the ncaa basketball tournament is associated with their experience at college , which leads them to share stories about their past , prompting co-workers to do the same . unlike __team-building__ experiences that compel employees to engage with one another , __game-viewing__ parties position people to connect voluntarily . and that feature can make all the difference . in recent years , a number of forward-thinking workplaces have begun leveraging march madness in intelligent ways . ogilvy & mather , for example , an international marketing agency based in new york , invites employees to watch tournament games on projection screens in conference rooms and the office cafeteria . to address the fact that not everyone has the time to follow college basketball , a virginia financial services firm called the motley fool offers a free `` __bracketology__ '' class , where __nonenthusiasts__ can get caught up on this year 's favorites and collect advice before filling out their brackets . a number of organizations , including office furniture manufacturer __turnstone__ , even serve __game-day__ snacks , such as pizza , popcorn , and chicken wings , to simulate the viewing experience of a sports bar , minus the alcohol . in addition to organizing a vibrant workplace gathering , there are also opportunities for making better use of the office tournament pool . here 's one idea : instead of having employees pay an entry fee -lrb- which discourages __nonfans__ from joining in -rrb- , sponsor prizes so that everyone participates . then , go beyond recognizing individual contestants and reward the team or department with the highest average score . this way , employees have reason to root for one another , fostering a sense of collaboration . another approach worth considering : using the office pool as a motivational tool . some years ago , __nettel__ partners , a sales organization in philadelphia , launched a competition among its __salespeople__ in the weeks before the ncaa tournament . the more appointments a __salesperson__ secured with potential clients , the sooner he or she could select a team in the office draft . the results were astonishing . total cost to __nettel__ for furnishing prizes : $ 300 , plus the price of a personalized basketball jersey . total impact on the business : a 35 % jump in appointments , not to mention a boost in office morale . as the ncaa tournament tips off this month , organizational leaders would be wise to re-examine their approach to march madness . instead of treating the tournament as a nuisance that prevents employees from working , perhaps it 's time we considered embracing it for what it is : an inexpensive opportunity for bringing our work teams closer together . without the trust falls .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's hardly news to state that air pollution is bad for people 's health . what might be more surprising to learn , though , is that air pollution is bad for the health of an unborn child , long before his or her lungs ever take their first breath . a growing body of research indicates that various forms of air pollution have a measurable impact on the health of babies , both in __utero__ and after birth . we imagine the infant to be protected inside its mother 's body , but pollutants can reach the baby the same way nutrients and medicine do . lead , mercury and __particulate__ matter are among the types of air pollution we know can impact the health of infants before and after birth . ozone , or smog , is the next candidate for addition to the list of air pollutants known to be harmful to fetal health . over the past several years , a number of studies have indicated a likely link between higher levels of maternal ozone exposure and poor health outcomes in infants , including changes in lung structure and function , low birth weight and __neuro-behavioral__ abnormalities . many of these health effects can be expected to have lifelong consequences . these are deeply concerning results that require more investigation to understand fully . these studies add to a substantial amount of evidence showing the ill effects of ozone for people of all ages . estimates place the toll in 2007 at 15,000 premature deaths related to ozone among individuals of all ages . ozone also causes shortness of breath , wheezing and coughing , asthma attacks , increased risk of respiratory infections and increased need for people with lung diseases -- such as children with asthma -- to get medical treatment or be admitted to the hospital . how can a pregnant woman protect herself and her growing fetus from the harm caused by ozone ? after all , ozone is usually invisible -lrb- except in certain cases , as smog -rrb- and high levels are undetectable to the average individual . summertime air quality alerts may help in some cases , but some pregnant women can not avoid exposure . in addition , studies confirm that these daily pollution alerts are inadequate to protect our health because they are based on the present federal ozone standard , which does not include evidence from current , critical health science . in other words , the alerts sometimes fail to accurately indicate when the air is dangerous to breathe . thinking that it 's safe to work or play outside when ozone pollution levels trigger a yellow air quality alert -lrb- indicating a `` moderate '' level for ozone pollution -rrb- can significantly threaten the health of many vulnerable individuals . in order to truly protect our children , we need strong , national standards limiting ozone . ozone forms in the air from emissions from a number of sources , but the biggest culprits are cars , trucks and other motor vehicles , as well as power plants . the u.s. environmental protection agency -lrb- epa -rrb- proposed new ozone standards in november that would bring limits in line with the science . epa is accepting comments from the public on the standard until tuesday , march 17 , and both of our organizations have expressed support . an updated standard would help ensure we have access to accurate information about the air we breathe , and help drive reductions in ozone pollution to protect the health of all americans . strengthening the ozone standard to reflect the best current science will help save lives and protect our families , including pregnant women and their babies .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- `` breast is best '' -- you could call it a mantra of sorts that sums up much of today 's research on breastfeeding . not only does breastfeeding have clear short-term benefits , such as protection from infectious diseases and a reduction in mortality , it 's also been shown to be associated with an increase in intelligence . prior studies have shown an increase of up to 7.5 iq points in elementary age children who were breastfed , as well as an increase in verbal , performance and comprehensive iq in adults . the latest addition to this perspective is a long-term study of infants born in __pelotas__ , brazil , in 1982 . published in lancet , the study interviewed __5,914__ new mothers about their plans for breastfeeding and then followed up to see how they did . `` information on breastfeeding duration was collected very close to the time when weaning happened , so we had a very precise information on the duration of breastfeeding , '' said study author , dr. bernardo __lessa__ __horta__ , in a podcast on lancet . what makes this study unique is that it followed the subjects all the way to age 30 . `` we were able to follow about 68 % of the participants , which is a very good follow-up rate , '' said __lessa__ __horta__ . `` we observed that breastfeeding was positively associated with performance and intelligence at 30 years old , as well as with education , school achievement and higher monthly incomes . '' in fact , __lessa__ __horta__ said the subjects who had been breastfed for 12 months or longer had a higher iq -lrb- about 3.7 points -rrb- , more years of education and earned roughly 20 % more than the average income level . `` it 's suggesting that the positive effect of breastfeeding on iq leads to a higher income , '' he said . `` this is our main finding at this moment . '' one possible reason for the advantage of breast milk , __lessa__ __horta__ added , is that it is `` rich in __long-chain__ __polyunsaturated__ fatty acids which are important to brain growth and development . '' called __lcpufa__ for short , these essential fatty acids are found in salmon and shellfish and have been added to infant formulas since the 1990s . however , the benefit to mental or __psychomotor__ development from adding __lcpufa__ to infant formula is unclear . because the study did not measure home life , intellectual stimulation or bonding between mother and child , it was not able to tease out whether these factors may have also contributed to the increase in iq . that leaves it open to critics , such as texas a&m professor joan wolf , author of `` is breast best ? `` this study does not address the very real possibility that mothers who choose to breastfeed , regardless of income or education , distinguish themselves from those who __bottle-feed__ in all kinds of ways that are likely to promote intelligence , '' wolf wrote cnn . for __lessa__ __horta__ , the implications of his study are clear : `` the finding supports the promotion of breastfeeding . it 's more evidence that besides the clear short term benefits , breastfeeding also has long term consequences in terms of human potential . ''
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     long-term study finds that iq at age 30 was nearly 4 points higher for babies breastfed for a year or more . study conducted in brazil also associates longer breastfeeding with higher income and education levels . critic points out that the study does n't account for other possible contributing factors .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- roberto mancini says he carries manchester city 's supporters in his heart -- but there 's not much love being shown towards the man who replaced him as manager of the premier league champions . manuel pellegrini is a man feeling the heat -- and the current city manager has come under fire from his predecessor just 24 hours after insisting he is not under pressure to win a trophy every season . mancini , the man who led manchester city to its first premier league title in 44 years back in 2012 says pellegrini is `` lucky '' to have inherited the side he left behind after being sacked exactly a year to the day since winning england 's top division . pellegrini , who led city to the domestic title last season , is under fire with city trailing chelsea by six points in the league and facing elimination in the european champions league . `` i think pellegrini was really lucky because he got this team that is a strong team and he has a chance to put in more good players , '' inter milan coach mancini told cnn 's don riddell on the eve of city 's crucial game with barcelona in the champions league . `` i think city can win a title every year and have a chance -- it should and must try to win a title every year . '' nicknamed `` the engineer , '' pellegrini has seen the wheels come off his side 's title charge in recent weeks . the chilean is reportedly on the brink with his team having apparently surrendered its premier league title with another meek showing in the 1-0 defeat by __minnow__ burnley last weekend . his team have managed just three victories in their past 11 games -- its season could be more or less over by tomorrow night . city faces a daunting task to reach the last eight of the european champions league -- a competition it has struggled in despite spending $ __482__ million on players since the start of the 2011-12 season . it must overturn a 2-1 deficit against barcelona at camp nou on wednesday after being outplayed for the majority of the home fixture . only once in nine attempts has barcelona won the first leg of a two-legged champions league knockout tie and not progressed . pellegrini has spent heavily since arriving at city but a number of those purchases have failed to impress . eliaquim mangala , who arrived from porto for $ __47million__ has endured a dismal first season in english football , while $ 32million man stevan jovetic has also struggled to make an impression since arriving from fiorentina . `` it 's my opinion that city is the best team in the premier league , '' said mancini . `` it 's in second and six points behind chelsea but i think it 's the best team . `` in the premier league anything can happen right up to the last game , in the last minute , '' perhaps a nod to city 's last gasp english premier league title win in 2012 , thanks to sergio aguero 's stoppage time winner against queens park rangers . `` i think they should think that they have a chance to win the title . '' mancini , who replaced mark hughes in december 2009 , enjoyed great success during his __three-and-half-year__ tenure . he led the club to the fa cup in 2011 before winning the league title the following season . under mancini , the club attracted star players such as yaya toure , mario balotelli , david silva and aguero . he signed a new five-year deal with the club in july 2012 but results dipped with rival manchester united regaining the league title and city suffering a shock fa cup final defeat by wigan . mancini was criticised for his side 's lack of success in the champions league , where the failure to negotiate the group stage playing a key role in the decision to relieve him of his duties . the italian , 50 , was also involved in a series of high-profile disagreements with carlos tevez , the argentina striker , which cast doubts over his ability to handle the big names in the city squad . in the 12 champions league ties under his stewardship , city managed just three victories -- a damning indictment on the team 's failure on the european stage . at the time of his sacking , the club said that mancini failed to hit `` stated targets '' and that it wanted to `` develop a holistic approach to all aspects of football '' . `` i had a fantastic time in england , '' he added . `` we won the premier league after many years . i have all city 's supporters in my heart and all those moments in my head because it is impossible to forget this . `` maybe i miss the premier league because i worked there for three-and-a-half years . i built the team that is now in second position . `` i think they play with the same players and i am very proud of this . '' mancini faces a struggle of his own at inter with the club unlikely to qualify for european competition next season . inter is eighth in serie a and is eight points off the qualifying places for the europa league . it faces german side wolfsburg in the last 16 of the europa league on thursday having lost the first leg 3-1 .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's recent speech to the u.s. congress has received disproportionate media attention across the world : the leader of america 's most important client state in the middle east defies the reservations of the white house , abusing congress as a platform for his israeli election campaign . disregarding israel 's already strained bilateral relations with the united states , netanyahu readily risked the consequences of humiliating the obama administration in exchange for less than an hour of political __self-manifestation__ -- typical for a man who is domestically known to be not much of a statesman . netanyahu is a charismatic speaker and a passionate __israel-advocate__ , however , his personal and political interests have always taken precedence over serving israel 's national interests . political survival has been the maxim of his domestic and foreign policies . netanyahu joins a long list of israeli politicians overwhelmed by the plurality and polarization of domestic public opinion . so far he has been just another israeli leader seeking `` easy '' short-term answers to fundamentally strategic problems , thereby further __protracting__ an already protracted conflict . as a puppet of ideological , conservative __playmakers__ who __whole-heartedly__ reject a two-state solution , netanyahu has been held hostage by the likes of foreign minister __avigdor__ lieberman and economy minister naftali bennett who pursue a discriminatory policy of sectarian segregation intending to contain palestinian public __dissidence__ through mere coercion . consequently , netanyahu 's foreign policy __vis-à-vis__ the peace process has been a disaster . he took over from ehud olmert and __tzipi__ livni -- two politicians who at least believed in a two-state solution and were ready to make sacrifices to keep the peace process alive . israeli leaders typically fall into two categories : those who believe in peace and those that have the power to make peace . olmert was the former , and netanyahu long seemed like he could become the latter . in reality , however , netanyahu is neither . he has given in to a toxic form of jewish nationalism , disregarded israel 's relatively good regional position __vis-à-vis__ its __otherwise-occupied__ arab neighbors ; he has continued to build settlements out of spite , thought of ever new preconditions for bilateral negotiations with the palestinians and waged a ruthless war against gaza without a clear strategic endgame -- a war that was lost militarily and in terms of international reputation . apart from the tragic effects of netanyahu 's policy on the peace process , his __stubbornness__ has alienated allies in europe and washington . while the arab world has been widely apathetic about the __israel-palestinian__ issue amid regional disintegration , partners on both sides of the atlantic have tried to facilitate the __revitalization__ of constructive peace talks . yet , netanyahu chose to ignore external initiatives , __retracting__ to a jewish nationalist rhetoric founded on security paranoia , __self-victimization__ and the illusion of israeli __autarky__ in security and defense . as a consequence , israel 's foreign relations with its most important strategic partners have noticeably cooled . obama 's middle eastern focus has shifted from the __israel/palestinian__ issue to a rapprochement with iran . european lawmakers are considering recognizing palestinian statehood despite israeli objections . more importantly , many traditionally pro-israel western __publics__ have turned their back on the jewish state . younger generations in particular refuse to accept the narrative that shaped their parental generation : israel as the david in a fight against goliath . israel 's monopoly on __victimhood__ has been undermined by an inflexible , uncompromising __short-minded__ policy towards a palestinian people under occupation whose narrative of __victimhood__ increasingly finds attentive ears in the west . at first sight , then , the prospect of four more years of netanyahu , does not sound too promising -- at least in regards to the peace process . at a closer look , however , a continuation of netanyahu 's policies might actually help the palestinian cause . his implicit rejection of the two-state solution ; his __prioritization__ of short-term security over sustainable security solutions ; his pursuit of a toxic jewish nationalist agenda justifying an __intensification__ of sectarianism between israel and the occupied territories as well as within israel , are all factors that will leave israel increasingly isolated . his __israel-first__ narrative might win netanyahu votes within a highly polarized electorate that in recent years has become more and more right-wing amid a top-down constructed climate of fear . hamas ' and hezbollah 's __mid-tech__ missile capability , syria 's __socio-political__ disintegration and subsequent rise of islamist __non-state__ actors , have been used by the netanyahu government to create an arab __bogyman__ ostensibly threatening the jewish state 's very existence -- a new __bogyman__ __coexisting__ side-by-side with netanyahu 's `` favorite '' __bogeyman__ , iran . despite netanyahu 's __pre-occupation__ with security , the derailment of the peace process has not been much of a topic during the campaign so far . if netanyahu receives another mandate on tuesday , israel will be further driven into the international offside , pressure from the west will increase and thereby the palestinian cause will receive ever more attention and support from policymakers and __publics__ across the world . netanyahu has become somewhat of a villain in the west -- an untrustworthy , short-sighted politician who in comparison to his counterparts in ramallah appears to lack the willingness to compromise , cooperate and empathize . thus , while another term of bibi will not be in the national interest of israel , it will very likely serve the palestinian interests .

ARTICEL:     london -lrb- cnn -rrb- tunisia 's __ultra-radical__ fringe has come back to bite a government born out of the most successful experiment in constitutional reform to emerge from the 2011 arab spring revolutions . wednesday 's attack on the __bardo__ museum in tunis was __grimly__ predictable , coming from what the tunisian interior ministry calls a violent __ultra-radical__ islamist fringe forced underground -- but not crushed -- by security services . jihadist __firebrands__ representing thousands of active militants at home and abroad have been threatening retribution on tunisia 's __outward-looking__ , __investment-friendly__ majority . the attack was carried out by two gunmen , believed to have been supported by at least two accomplices . it may torpedo efforts to revive tunisia 's __employment-generating__ tourism industry and may discourage other big-spending visitors . it will probably lead tunisians -- who have shown a sage propensity to unite in the face of greatest adversity despite a marked appetite for political bickering -- to support a robust response by elected president __beji__ __caid__ __essebsi__ . the attack adds to the global narrative by which islamic revolutionaries -- increasingly flying under the flag of the so-called islamic state -lrb- isis -rrb- -- pose an existential crisis to moderate states , often western allies , in the arab world . tunisia is the sole country to have emerged from an arab spring revolution with its political process intact -- current president , __essebsi__ , who was elected in november 2014 , and his ruling coalition , are the products of a long constitutional process . in four tumultuous years they have competed hard with , but also showed a capacity to work with , opposition parties , led by the `` moderate islamist '' ennahda , which is represented in government and parliament . islamists of a very different hue were responsible for the __bardo__ attack . local salafist groups -lrb- of whom the best known is ansar al-sharia -rrb- as well as multinational units including isis have been most effective in recruiting disaffected young tunisians in the capital 's poorer quarters and in dusty towns of the south and interior , where the original revolution that removed ben ali in february 2011 surged up . legitimate claims for more jobs and resources in these underprivileged areas during the four subsequent years have largely come to nothing , adding to frustrations . radical jihadists -- some with back bases in libya and algeria -- have posed a major security challenge to successive governments , murdering two prominent `` secular '' politicians in 2013 . the tunisian armed forces , supported by algeria 's more experienced and better equipped military , have been fighting jihadist radicals in the mount __chaambi__ region for nearly three years . they have yet to declare final victory , pointing to the resilience of underground groups . while successive governments have acted against radical salafist groups , thousands of tunisians have gone underground ; they are widely believed to make up the biggest national group fighting with jihadists in syria -lrb- over 3,000 by many accounts -rrb- , and are present in libya and other failing states . in january 2013 , tunisians and libyans made up the majority of jihadists who attacked a strategic gas plant operated by bp and __statoil__ in southern algeria . so , the __bardo__ attackers are a known enemy . prime minister habib __essid__ has promised a robust security response . but the tunis tragedy is unlikely to have any immediate impact on the political process . a majority of tunisians remain foursquare behind preserving `` republican institutions , '' even if they vocally disagree on the detail of policy . it will remind tunisia 's many friends that the country 's transition is brittle , and that tunis needs commitments of support to become reality , with more military and wider financial assistance , and , above all , investment that can kickstart an economy in the doldrums since 2011 . massacre at the __bardo__ places tunisia more centrally within the global isis narrative , which has recently expanded to neighboring libya . it is a ghastly way to remind the world that tunisia 's experiment in democratic reform needs all the help it can get .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- december 16 , 2014 was a dark day , not just in our nation 's history , but the world 's . young innocent children were brutally massacred in a school in peshawar along with their teachers . it shook a nation that had already seen more than 55,000 of its innocent civilians die in the hands of terrorism in the last 10 years , to a whole new level . naturally , i was in no less despair . hailing from a humble background , where both my parents have served in the field of education their entire lives , the strong emphasis on education in our house was probably another reason why this incident had affected me so deeply . read more : bloodstains , bullet holes mark peshawar classrooms . i canceled my tours and concerts and could n't gather myself to do much in coming weeks . however , being an artist , i had to express myself ; even more so because i have always believed that an artist should be more than a tool for his art to resonate through . he must also resonate the voice of his surroundings by being socially aware and strive to contribute to his environment for the better in whatever little or large manner that he decides for himself . i thought that each one of us needed to wake up to this call and help and inspire the other to do more for our future . so i picked up the phone and started calling all my colleagues from film , fashion , tv and music . i was pleasantly surprised that all of them agreed with my initiative and came on board without a second thought on such a short notice . we all got together because we all want a progressive , peaceful , tolerant and positive pakistan . and the response to the song and video further solidified my belief that every pakistani wants the same . they just need someone to show them the way . and to me , education is the way forward . it 's the the key to progress and peace . i also feel that there is a lot more to pakistan than what the world gets to see . pakistan is a beautiful land with beautiful people who -- like those in any other nation -- want to live in harmony with themselves and the world . a place where people sing , dance and play . unfortunately because of an extremist minority , it is sometimes seen as an extremist country . but no society is void of extremism in one way or the other . this is something that we all need to work towards -- the international community and us . pakistan needs your help . it has been fighting this battle for years and lost countless lives in the process . its economy has also suffered . the world needs to see pakistan in a whole different light to help us out of this darkness . they need to partner with us towards progress . they need to understand the complexities of this society and the fact that it 's not easy to survive through all that this country has been through . today the entire nation stands as one for this cause . and that is what i have tried to show the world in this video . a pakistan that stands united to make sure that the lives of those innocent children did not go to waste . i also did n't want this to be just a song . i wanted to practically help towards a cause dear to me -- education . so , i collaborated with a leading pakistani educational non-profit organization , the citizens foundation -lrb- __tcf__ -rrb- and __141schools__ . org -lrb- 141 schools -rrb- , a new citizen web movement . together , they are building 141 schools across pakistan . each school will be dedicated to the children and teachers who lost their lives in attack on december 16 , 2014 . all proceeds from the downloads of the song will go towards building schools for the children of pakistan and ensuring a bright future . i aspire to build at least one school which would cost around __20.7__ million __pkr__ -lrb- $ __202,900__ -rrb- . if you want to help , click here .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- in the midst of all the shouting over indiana 's new __religious-freedom__ law , which many fear will lead to increased discrimination against lgbt people , culture warriors marked the grim anniversary of another conservative `` victory , '' one that left more than 10,000 needy children without their pledged financial support . a year ago this week , i rose each morning with red , puffy eyes and heavy sense of exhaustion . i had n't slept soundly since march 26 , a day many of my friends and readers mark as the last day they wanted anything to do with organized christianity . it all started when world vision , a humanitarian organization i had long supported and promoted , announced a change to its hiring policy allowing people in same-sex marriages to work in its u.s. offices . in response , conservative evangelicals rallied , and within 72 hours , more than 10,000 children had lost their financial support from canceled world vision sponsorships . __ten-thousand__ children . in addition , funding for schools , hospitals , water projects , and medical care was threatened as churches vowed to cut off support to an organization that hired lgbt people . as one of my readers , anthony , recalls , `` our church leadership vowed that they would pull all support , including over $ 2 million to build two hospitals in zambia . '' to try and stem some of the bleeding , i joined with other world vision bloggers to encourage my readers to sponsor children or make one-time donations to the organization . we had raised several thousand dollars and multiple sponsorships -- many coming from gay and lesbian couples -- when the ceo of world vision announced the charity would reverse its decision and return to its old policies discriminating against gay and lesbian employees . it had worked . using wells and hospitals and child sponsorships as bargaining chips in the culture wars had actually worked . never in my life had i been so angry at my own faith tradition . many conservative evangelicals count the world vision reversal as a major victory in the culture wars . eric __teetsel__ , director of the manhattan declaration , told christianity today he considered it `` the best news of 2014 '' for evangelical christians . `` this was christianity at its best , '' he said . but as i survey the battlefield a year later , i ca n't help but wonder if even the most strident culture warriors would consider the world vision campaign worth its many casualties . there are , of course , the families around the world affected by the sudden drying up of funds meant to support their hospitals and schools , not to mention the kids who used to receive letters and gifts from their sponsors , but whose pictures were casually ripped from the refrigerator and tossed into the garbage can once they were deemed __expendable__ collateral in an american political battle . then there are the many gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender people , -lrb- especially lgbt christians caught in the middle -rrb- , for whom the campaign represented yet another blow to their humanity . i remember a gay friend of mine telling me , through tears , `` christians do n't even think i 'm worthy of answering phones in the office of a humanitarian organization . what makes them think i would be welcome in their churches ? '' and then there are the many christians and former christians for whom the world vision campaign was the final straw in a drawn-out disillusionment with organized religion . when i marked the anniversary with a facebook status on the topic , i was surprised by how many of my readers marked march 26 as the day they left the church . `` i do n't think i can ever get over this , '' wrote kelly . `` changed my views on __evangelicalism__ and my faith forever . '' anthony , who once taught sunday school at his church , only rarely attends now . this is the tragic irony of the culture wars : the casualties tend to be the very people jesus went out of his way to serve : the poor , the sick , the marginalized , the outcasts , the people ostracized and deemed `` __sinners__ '' by the religious elite . and when the world sees christians hurting rather than helping such people , in the name of political gain , our testimony is profoundly diminished . we have lost the way of jesus when we are more committed to __self-preservation__ than service , more occupied with waging war than washing feet . in all likelihood , indiana 's __religious-freedom__ law will not directly affect many people . but the conversation that has surrounded it , in which discrimination against lgbt people has been characterized as a `` deeply held religious belief , '' will have far more lasting effects , not unlike the effects of the campaign against world vision . so to the culture warriors , i plead : before you wage the next campaign , assess the potential collateral damage and ask yourself if it 's worth it . remember that the fruit of the spirit is not power or might , influence or entitlement . the fruit of the spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , __faithfulness__ , __gentleness__ , and self control , and `` against such things , there is no law '' -lrb- __galatians__ __5:23__ -rrb- . and to the wounded , i offer only this : you are not alone . please know there are field medics -- pastors and priests , artists and activists , poets and parents and healers and dreamers -- ready to welcome you back to faith and to church whenever you 're ready . we can walk the long road to healing together , even if it 's with a limp .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     indiana 's religious freedom law will not directly affect many people , but conversation around it , will have lasting effects , writes held evans . the casualties of the culture wars tend to be the very people jesus went out of his way to serve , says evans .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the debate over health care reform once again blooms in d.c. , but this time democrats and the president whose legacy rests on the affordable care act are tending a garden challenged by some rather invasive species . the gop has kicked off its season by pulling obamacare up by the roots in its proposed 2016 house budget . but this budget will not become law . and so republicans are also preparing strategic plays if the supreme court rules in their favor this summer , or if a republican wins the white house next year backed by complementary majorities in the house and senate . either scenario would mortally wound obamacare . but this is n't a zero sum game . smart republicans already know they do n't win just because the other side loses . __upending__ obamacare may poison the gop 's standing with 16.4 million americans who will face adverse , even dire consequences without legislative patches to the law , or a swift switch to a solid alternative health care policy . this week , the conservative weekly the washington examiner aimed to mark obamacare 's fifth anniversary by asking a panel whether to `` reform , replace or restart '' the law . a gas leak scuttled the event . once they 've regrouped for their next panel , republicans should instead entertain a different r : revise . so far every plan republicans are offering strikes out any mandate to purchase insurance , which , oddly for a party celebrating self-reliance , encourages some people to continue shifting their adult responsibilities onto others . many of the gop plans replace the subsidies that make exchange plans affordable for low-income americans with tax credits . tax credits do n't make much sense when you do n't have a lot of taxes to pay in the first place . these alternatives appear to be thinly veiled transitions away from the key obamacare principle of providing guaranteed access . to date the law has reduced the rates of uninsured americans by a whopping 35 % . sen. ted cruz , r-texas , lifted his veil even during his own plan 's debut by insisting `` every last word of obamacare must be repealed '' while promoting his own health care choices act that ditches subsidies and the mandate . republican presidential front-runner jeb bush shares cruz 's preference to dismantle the `` monstrosity '' altogether , describing his preference for cheaper catastrophic insurance that helps people with massive bills but leaves poor americans to fend for themselves when it comes to needless perks -- like insulin and blood pressure pills . and besides repealing the aca , house budget committee chairman tom price , __r-georgia__ , wants to tear into president lyndon johnson 's great society achievements as well . his budget proposal __dismantles__ the federal medicaid program by slashing its funding and __devolving__ it to the states , while asking seniors on medicare to try their luck with a __voucher-discounted__ private insurance . what these approaches do n't get is that we live in a country entirely populated by citizens who want and expect to receive medical care when they need it , yet not all of these citizens want to pay anything for the privilege . the beating heart of obamacare is its mandate to purchase health insurance , which keeps costs down for everyone , makes it fiscally feasible to cover patients with pre-existing conditions , and makes government subsidies possible for those who ca n't afford any insurance without them . if republicans shift their focus to revising obamacare , there are an array of spots to trim and weeds to pull , and they can expect many democrats to join in the work . but after dealing with a withering onslaught of over 60 republican attempts to kill the bill , democrats ca n't make even the most basic fixes for fear of losing everything . but there are some places to look . even aca supporters can acknowledge some specific __anti-competitive__ features in the law . this should interest republicans . the aca 's push toward __offloading__ risk onto hospitals rather than insurers is encouraging hospital consolidation , with large hospital corporations seeking to build economies of scale to offset future risk this trend may drive up costs as hospitals face less competition . meanwhile consumers shopping the exchange plans can select from few __in-network__ hospitals and physicians , again making the health care marketplace less competitive . the united states may be graced with institutions offering stellar care in complex conditions that attract patients across state lines as well as across the world , centers that contribute to medicine generally through their research and training . but going out of state to seek such care is n't an option for many patients on exchange plans . cruz proposes opening up health insurance markets nationally , an idea that we should build on . years of a rough economy have left many consumers without the income or savings to pay the high __copays__ , __deductibles__ , and out-of-pocket __maximums__ that obamacare uses as a __cost-control__ measure . among families making 250 % to 400 % over the federal poverty line , 55 % to 68 % ca n't make their __deductible__ , depending on their plan . the numbers are considerably worse for families under that threshold , and even for families making over 400 % of the poverty line , 25 % to 38 % ca n't pay the out of pocket maximum if they become seriously ill . despite these costs , the aca __penalizes__ responsible consumers further by capping flexible spending accounts . furthermore , obamacare is in part more expensive than it might be because it takes a gamble covering preventive testing for people with no sign of disease for `` free , '' yet makes patients with chronic conditions pay __deductibles__ even when we know their care will save money in the long run . that 's not the most rational distribution of funds if we 're trying to do the greatest good for the greatest number at the lowest cost . since jeb bush is interested in focusing on the __big-ticket__ items and not sweating the small stuff , perhaps this is an area where he can throw his support . obamacare is n't a work of art by any means . it 's a messy , pragmatic attempt to reach a goal the majority of americans want : access to affordable health care when it 's needed . some rather fundamental revisions lie ahead , like a forthcoming administrative decision on whether to continue allowing state variability among the prescribed essential health benefits it covers . so , my advice to republicans is that they pick one or two specific aspects of obamacare they 'd like to improve , let 's have the policy debate , then introduce your legislative fix to the existing law , leaving its beating heart intact . show you 're open to constructively improving the aca and i 'm sure we 'll see democrats start coming to the table with their own pet __peeves__ about the law . 2016 does n't have to be a __hyperbolic__ , __hyperventilating__ contest for the fate of 16.4 million americans .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     ford vox : with its budget proposal to kill obamacare , or hopes the supreme court will do the same , the gop makes a mistake . he says 16.4 million americans benefiting . smart republicans know this ; should instead tease out problematic parts of aca to revise .

ARTICEL:     new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- kayla mueller , peter kassig , alan henning , david haines -- just a few of the aid workers who have been abducted and killed by isis in the past year . the exact number of aid workers currently being held is unknown ; a level of secrecy tends to surround details of those currently captive . what we do know is isis holds at least one female aid worker , and possibly more . the international federation of the red cross confirmed three aid workers who disappeared in october 2013 remain missing , but would not comment on their identities or who kidnapped them . abductions and killings of aid workers are , unfortunately , nothing new , but the numbers are . according to __aidworkersecurity.org__ , at least 155 aid workers were killed in 2013 , a 121 % increase on 70 recorded killings the year before . not all were victims of isis , a relatively new phenomenon given life by the chaos in embattled syria . in fact , according to the same report , it is the taliban who have historically kidnapped in the greatest numbers , in large part in afghanistan . here 's the difference : isis is changing the game . the taliban may have many reasons for abductions -lrb- flexing their muscles , negotiating prisoner releases -rrb- , but they also have a record of frequent hostage release . the need for aid in a specific region and the level of the acceptance by the community matters , or mattered . for isis , it appears to matter less . abducted aid workers are usually either a source of considerable income -lrb- isis demanded at least $ 6 million for kayla mueller , and reportedly $ 200 million for two japanese hostages -rrb- or , failing that , their killings provide a lurid display of brutality for the world to witness . so far the number of hostages of all backgrounds freed by isis is extremely low , save for those whose ransoms were paid . the freeing of 19 kidnapped assyrian christians shocked many , because release is not a common part of isis ' playbook . these tactics can serve as models to other extremist groups worldwide , who may look to emulate isis ' model of abduction and violence . one example is west african extremist group boko haram , which released a video purportedly showing the beheading of two men claimed to be spies , an approach disturbingly similar to isis ' . `` humanitarian work has always been risky , but it 's never been more dangerous than it is now , '' says __caryl__ stern , president and ceo of the u.s. fund for unicef . `` there used to be a time when an organization 's flag provided a great deal of protection . that 's no longer the case . '' the response in large part from aid agencies has not been to pull out of syria and its __environs__ altogether , but to rely almost exclusively on local staffers . still , outside workers like mueller , kassig , henning and haines were inside syria when they were taken , and the regional directors of aid agencies continue to travel there frequently in order to oversee operations . not only that , but simply by virtue of working for a large aid agency , local staffers become bait . indeed , the majority of victims have been working in their own countries . isis does n't just target aid workers . journalists , soldiers and anyone who conceivably could fetch a ransom are high on their hit list . but in the wild west that is syria and its borders , few of these remain , save for aid workers . in a space devoid of government , refugee camps and aid agencies are frequently seen as the only authorities , the new front line in the war on terror , a sometimes unwelcome association . and as isis spreads beyond syria 's borders , the risks grow further afield . yet despite these risks , thousands of aid workers continue to work in a region where the u.n. high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- estimates the number of refugees from conflict at more than 8 million . while some aid agencies rely on security personnel for protection , many are completely unarmed and are particularly vulnerable when in transit . their security and locations for the most part are under constant review . when cnn approached a number of reputable aid agencies asking to speak to those who work or travel in the region about their experiences , and what drives them to remain despite an unprecedented threat level , many declined , in large part due to security concerns . for this reason , some of those mentioned below are wholly or partially anonymous . if i think back , i 've been doing this work for about 20 years , and i remember we used to have this sense that there was some sort of protection , some sort of ... humanitarian space ... it feels very much like that is shrinking ... our job is becoming much , much more difficult ; we 're asking people to put themselves in harm 's way in some circumstances . i mean , we do n't do that , but it 's not the exception any more . my family is not thrilled at all because what they see on the news is westerners being kidnapped and beheaded ... when they worry , i worry about them and that does n't help me be in a good state of mind to do my work . i 'm very selective about where i say i go . i need to find ways to switch off and do silly things and not worry about the dire situation that 's here , not just the humanitarian situation but ... being responsible for the people i 'm responsible for in this region . i do n't think people see the human side so much ... innocent people who through no fault of their own have been forced to flee their home one , two , three times -- who do n't see a future for their children ... someone has to be there to help and support and provide some sense of safety and security , and i mean that in the personal sense of a mother who , when she goes to sleep at night with her children , she knows she has a blanket to keep them warm and something to feed them the next day . fear is always there in the back of everyone 's mind . we just need to continue what we 're doing , stopping is not an option , halting our operations is not an option , and we are taking great risks , our staff are taking great risks . it is a difficult thing to tell family , to tell colleagues . oftentimes i just do n't mention all the details of where i go because they just do n't need to know . but it needs to be done , we also ca n't run an operation remotely . ... i 'm not going to the front lines , i 'm not going to where the conflict is actually hot ... we 're not adrenaline driven people . we want to be able to help the people and do our work and to do our work does entail taking some risks , but it 's about calculated risks . we do n't want to put ourselves directly in front of danger . if we say we give up on it for whatever reason -- security , morale , pressure from here , pressure from there -- no one else is going to come to take our place . there 's not going to be another organization that 's going to come and do more humanitarian aid and cover the gap that __iocc__ may create , that 's not going to happen . so that puts more responsibility on the shoulders of our staff and the shoulders of our organization ; we feel that responsibility that we 've got to deliver on this thing . donate to __iocc__ . there 's an internal motivation that keeps you going . you feel that there are populations and people that need aid and require assistance , and know it 's a choice that one makes and dedicate your life service . so yes , you need be of course strong , motivated , passionate , and of course feel the need to assist and deliver . it 's an unprecedented time , and what we 're calling the new normal ... as we 've seen in the last year , the complete radicalization of these spaces with extremist groups , who have a very hard view in terms of cooperation with neutral and humanitarian organizations such as ours ... we 're not the u.s. army , we do n't have a physical ability to repel . there may be in people 's perceived minds there was a golden age of humanitarian acceptance : like if you were a charity and waved a white flag and drove a white car , you 'd be protected by bad guys and loved by the community . i think that golden age is more myth than reality , but regarding today 's reality it 's extremely dangerous it 's so true . and your flag , your neutrality , your white car , all the good intention you have , that recipe is very difficult in these complicated emergencies . there 's a phrase that the u.n. uses and a lot of ngos use which is `` stay and deliver , '' so we have a humanitarian imperative to be there , but we always have to be in a risk management role ; we have to critically look at : do the risks outweigh the benefits we hope to get ? the fear factor comes in just managing the emotional toll it takes with your family and friends , and that has more of a toll , i think , with individual staff members than actual external environment ... frankly , sometimes i do n't tell them till i 'm already on my way so i do n't have to have those calls before i even get on an airplane . it 's hard ; there are some areas where the family and friends do n't understand why you 're going there , and you __re-articulate__ , `` if not you , then who ? '' and you ask , `` would you want this in your neighborhood next door where no one comes to help you if something bad happened ? '' donate to mercy corps . for ways to donate to organizations working to help refugees from isis and from the conflict in that region , go to cnn.com / impact . cnn 's betsy anderson and julia chan contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- ferguson city manager john shaw resigned tuesday in the wake of a scathing justice department report . the report blames ferguson , missouri , police and courts for abusive behavior that disproportionately targets african-american residents . `` over the last several months i have done everything in my power to work with countless groups to bring about positive change and strengthen our community , '' shaw wrote in his resignation letter . he continued : `` during this time i have also worked closely with the department of justice to identify opportunities to improve , and then moved quickly to implement its recommendations for change . `` and while i certainly respect the work that the doj recently performed in their investigation and report on the city of ferguson , i must state clearly that my office has never instructed the police department to target african americans , nor __falsify__ charges to administer fines , nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor . any __inferences__ of that kind from the report are simply false . '' shaw 's resignation was announced the same day the city council voted 7-0 on a mutual separation agreement with shaw . residents elect city council members , who in turn appoint the city manager . the city manager directs and __supervises__ all city departments , including the police department . along with other officials , shaw was heavily criticized by the justice department report , which found that authorities in ferguson frequently saw residents as `` sources of revenue . '' in fact , the city enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that ferguson , population 21,000 , was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in st. louis county by having more than $ 1 million in revenue in 2010 , the report said . in one march 2012 email , the captain of the patrol division reported to shaw that court collections the previous month reached $ 235,000 -- the first month collections exceeded $ 200,000 . the city manager reported the email to the city council , congratulating police and court staff on their `` great work , '' the report said . when ferguson court revenues exceeded $ 2 million for the whole of 2012 , the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email : `` awesome ! thanks ! '' according to the federal report . the doj 's probe came after public outcry over the death of unarmed black teenager michael brown , who was shot by ferguson police officer darren wilson in august . wilson , who was not indicted on any charges , has resigned from the police department . but when ferguson resident sue schmidt defended wilson at tuesday 's city council meeting , she heard vocal objections from those in the crowd . `` i 'd like to say a lot of people in this room owe darren wilson an apology , '' schmidt said , prompting laughter by some in the audience . `` the same justice report that you 're basing all your opinions on cleared him 100 % .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's playing out like a scene from `` night of the living dead '' -- in the boardroom of one of italy 's most famous clubs . director george a. romero 's horror cult classic revolved around a swarm of slow-moving __cannibalistic__ corpses snacking on the inhabitants of a shopping mall and parma general manager and team legend alessandro __melli__ talks in similarly apocalyptic tones as he details the financial crisis engulfing the serie a club . `` it seems like we are zombies , working without knowing where we are heading , '' __melli__ told cnn 's don riddell . rooted at the bottom of italy 's top flight , parma has debts of approximately $ 100 million and faces a looming financial collapse -- barring a miracle ownership rescue . the club has been docked points twice this season for failing to pay its players and faces a bankruptcy hearing on march 19 . `` every day they take away a part of our work and piece of our hearts . bits of the club are foreclosed every day and we come here to work just because we love our work and our team , but we can not do our job , '' added __melli__ . `` we 're living in a nightmare , whichever way you look at it . because this is not just about the money , even though we ca n't ignore it , there is a lot more that they are taking away . dignity , the smile ; they took away our respect and it hurts . '' last season parma finished sixth in serie a , only to be barred from taking part in european football 's second tier competition -- the europa league -- over an income tax bill . between 1992 and 2002 parma won two uefa cups , the 1992 european cup winners ' cup and three italian cups in a successful spell between 1992 and 2002 . in 1997 , led by current real madrid coach carlo ancelotti and with the caliber of players like gianfranco zola , __faustino__ __asprilla__ and hernan crespo , parma finished runners-up in serie a. `` look at the team we had , '' said angelo __manfredini__ , president of the parma supporters club , referring to those __halycon__ days , as he rattled off other players including __melli__ , fabio cannavaro and longtime italy captain and goalkeeper gianluigi buffon , who now plays for juventus . `` all were players who meant something to football . '' fast forward to more austere times and parma 's current players have n't been paid since august . they 're so fed up they 've threatened to go on strike -- that is if the games are allowed proceed in the first place , with two of parma 's recent fixtures having been called off given the club 's problems . parma was once owned by the world 's leading dairy company , __parmalat__ spa , which collapsed under financial fraud in 2003 . the club has already changed hands twice this season after a __russian-cypriot__ conglomerate sold the club to __giampietro__ __manenti__ . a despairing __melli__ depicted a club that is being seemingly taken apart seat by seat , screw by screw . `` one day , we wo n't have the laundry anymore , '' said __melli__ . `` the next day , computers -lrb- will be -rrb- taken away , then we do n't have emails anymore . `` and then the physical objects related to sport , like benches , like the team bus ... everyday it 's like being stabbed . '' for his part , __manenti__ has reportedly said he will not sell the club , which will likely mean another spell in administration for parma , the second time in the past 10 years . their next scheduled match is a home game on march 22 against torino , but __melli__ is more concerned about what the future holds in store for parma rather than the next 90 minutes . `` i hope to have a new owner to sort out our debts and save the brand , starting again from serie b and to start again with new management that loves what they are managing , '' said __melli__ . `` slowly , we can rebuild . it will take time and patience , with the right people in the right places . only in this way can parma be reborn like a phoenix . `` objectively , it 's unlikely this will happen . this is just the hope of a lover , trying to find his lost love . but he needs the help of others , we ca n't make it by ourselves .

'' the idea behind `` moneyball '' is to obtain maximum value for each player bought or sold . __beane__ has had a longstanding fascination with european football , citing arsenal 's arsene wenger as a manager he admires for his blend of performance on the pitch and financial prudence . the american has said in the past that it was his dream to be an executive at a football club once his baseball career ended . it turns out he did n't have to wait that long . `` i think it 's interesting and exciting for him personally , '' said chris anderson , co-founder of the sports analytics consultancy anderson sally . `` he 's been a football fan for many , many years and is very well informed about the sport and industry . this is not as much a stretch as one might imagine ; he actually knows football . '' __beane__ will retain his general manager duties with the oakland a 's , a team that remains competitive despite sporting one of the lowest __payrolls__ in major league baseball -lrb- mlb -rrb- . the a 's have qualified for mlb 's playoffs each of the past three seasons , only to be knocked out before the world series every time . critics of baseball 's __sabermetrics__ system -- using data to analyze the sport as exposed in michael lewis ' `` moneyball '' book which inspired the film -- are quick to point out that __beane__ has never won a title with the a 's . in holland , __beane__ wo n't need to start from scratch , as az currently sits comfortably in fourth place in the dutch eredivisie . az 's director of football __earnie__ stewart is a known `` moneyball '' fan himself , having organized a screening for his fellow az execs shortly after joining the club . the former u.s. midfielder , who scored against colombia in the 1994 world cup , is __half-dutch__ and hopes the collaboration with __beane__ can give the club an extra edge . `` we 've had a lot of contact with billy in the last few months '' , stewart told the club 's website . `` his knowledge and ideas are impressive . also billy 's soccer network is excellent . we have already noticed that billy thinks two steps ahead in the area of innovation . that 's what really connects with the ambitions of __az.__ '' like the a 's , az have managed to compete with the big boys of the dutch league -- chiefly psv and ajax -- on a limited budget , winning the domestic league twice -- most recently in 2009 -- while finishing in the top five in three of the past five seasons . __beane__ 's philosophy is shaped by getting maximum bang for your buck in the transfer market . `` there is a misconception that you never pay much for anybody , but that is not true at all , '' __beane__ told the telegraph in 2011 . `` you want to make sure you are getting more value than you are paying . that may come in the form of a very expensive player , it may come in the form of a very young player , but it 's not about being cheap or not spending money . '' but it 's questionable whether `` moneyball '' principles can be applied to football , a sport where -- unlike in u.s. sports leagues -- players are rarely traded for one another . instead , athletes are sold for prices determined by a marketplace , __untethered__ by salary caps . however , anderson argues __beane__ could be about to exploit a gap in the market . `` i would say unequivocally that markets for players are much more inefficient in soccer than in baseball , '' said anderson , who also wrote `` the numbers game : everything you know about football is wrong . '' `` the combination of a global market plus __inefficiency__ means that is a huge opportunity in soccer that there is n't in the same way in baseball . '' either way , __beane__ is likely to relish the challenge of __imparting__ his knowledge to the boardrooms of european football , perhaps even as a __pre-cursor__ to a full time job in the sport . `` i think he certainly would be open to the possibility of taking on a role , '' said anderson , adding that __beane__ could be using the advisory position to dip his toe into the __shark-infested__ waters of football player transfers . `` in football we 're still in a pre - ` moneyball ' era , '' added anderson . `` so the baseball equivalent of the mid-1990s . is the football equivalent of 2015 .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the university of north carolina will pay whistleblower mary willingham $ __335,000__ to settle her lawsuit with the university , following the largest academic fraud scandal in ncaa history . willingham is the former athletics literacy counselor who blew the whistle about the fake classes that went on for nearly 20 years at the prestigious university . willingham spent years fielding attacks from university officials -- including accusations that she was lying when she said that officials within the athletic department steered __underprepared__ athletes into the fake classes to keep them eligible . for nearly five years , unc denied those claims , but willingham refused to keep quiet . she first told her story to the news & observer in raleigh , and then to national media when the university refused to admit that the classes were well-known to faculty . the added attention forced unc to hire a new investigator and launch a new probe in 2014 . that latest review , led by ken wainstein , a 19-year veteran of the u.s. justice department , found exactly what willingham had always claimed -- widespread and systematic cheating . willingham left her job last spring after complaining that she was being retaliated against . `` the university 's settlement with mrs. willingham resolves all of the outstanding legal issues in the case , '' said rick white , associate vice chancellor of communications and public affairs . `` we appreciate the efforts of the mediator to help us achieve a successful and timely conclusion to the mediation . we believe the settlement is in the best interest of the university and allows us to move forward and fully focus on other important issues . '' when she sued , willingham said she hoped to accomplish what no other investigation has done -- to subpoena documents and to depose university officials under oath . her lawsuit never got that far . instead , she says she 's hoping that will be accomplished by a larger class-action lawsuit filed by powerhouse attorney michael __hausfeld__ on behalf of two former unc athletes . devon ramsay and __rashanda__ __mccants__ both sued in january , saying they were promised an education but did n't get one because of the paper class scandal . __hausfeld__ is the attorney who beat the ncaa last summer in federal court on behalf of former ucla player ed __o'bannon__ , winning a case that will forever change college sports by forcing the ncaa to eliminate the rule that forbids schools from paying players . that lawsuit is the reason willingham says she was ok with entering into mediation in her whistleblower suit . she shared the settlement document with cnn . `` it 's about the students and not about me . i do n't need it to be about me , '' willingham said . `` i got an education , but those students left without one , and we still have a system that does n't work . and so i 'm hopeful that -lrb- the __hausfeld__ lawsuit -rrb- will move forward and prove that -lrb- ncaa division i -rrb- schools all across the country have a flawed system where a promise of an education is n't happening , and therefore these students are getting nothing . '' willingham is co-founder of paper class inc. , which serves as a portal and rallying point for the college sports reform movement and includes a program to give students reading help in middle school . cnn analysis : some college athletes play like adults , read like __fifth-graders__ .

ARTICEL:     beijing -lrb- cnn -rrb- when it came to the environment in china , it was hazy through much of the weekend -- literally and __figuratively__ . as a thick layer of toxic air blanketed beijing and much of northern china on friday , censors smothered a wildly popular but controversial documentary on the country 's air pollution , removing it from all major video streaming sites . at a __standing-room-only__ press conference saturday , the newly appointed minister of environmental protection ignored raised hands of foreign journalists eager to ask about the development and made no mention of the documentary that he had praised just a week earlier . without a hint of irony , he promised to be more transparent and reassured the masses of their right to oversee the government 's fight against air pollution . `` under the dome '' -- a __slickly__ produced two-hour documentary on journalist chai jing 's dogged quest to find the causes and solutions to china 's severe smog problem -- attracted over 200 million views online in just one week , an unprecedented number even in the world 's most populous nation . supporters and detractors of chai , a famous former anchor and reporter at state-run national broadcaster cctv , began a war of words almost immediately after the video 's release on february 28 . admirers compared it to `` an inconvenient truth , '' the oscar-winning documentary on former u.s. vice president al gore 's effort to raise awareness on the dangers of global warming . critics , on the other hand , portrayed it as a piece of shoddy investigative journalism filled with bad science and biased conclusions , which blamed the problem largely on the entrenched interests of the state oil industry . some even called it propaganda for president xi jinping , who had declared keeping the sky blue a top policy priority . the new environment minister 's initial response to the video -- in the form of a widely reported text message of gratitude to chai -- reinforced some doubts over chai 's claim of editorial independence for her __self-funded__ project . many more people , however , perceived it as an encouraging sign of the government 's adoption of a more open attitude to a politically sensitive topic , as xi and other leaders started to publicly acknowledge the severity and urgency of the issue . but such optimism was dashed 24 hours after the documentary 's launch , as censors moved to reign in increasingly heated online debates surrounding air pollution and beyond , and removed all mention of the video from __homepages__ of major websites . as the week progressed , leaked state media memos -- widely circulated on social media -- revealed __ever-harsher__ wording from propaganda authorities as they scrambled to limit the continuing impact of the video . finally , after millions of clicks , `` under the dome '' vanished from much of chinese cyberspace friday as heavy smog descended on the capital . also in beijing were almost 3,000 delegates who had gathered to attend the national people 's congress , china 's __rubber-stamp__ parliament that meets in full once a year to approve the ruling communist party 's legislative proposals . pollution has remained a hot topic at this year 's session , state-run xinhua news agency reported , adding that xi vowed to legislators friday `` to give an iron hand to any polluters in the __smog-choked__ country . '' with chai 's viral video also encountering an iron hand , analysts explained that the seeming contradiction makes perfect sense in a one-party dictatorship with little tolerance for open dissent . `` smog is like any other problem in china -- dig it too deep and you touch the issue of political system , '' said yao bo , a well-known news commentator with more than 1.2 million followers on chinese social media . `` the video does n't do that but comments on it had started to question the system . '' `` i think the video caught censors off guard , '' he added , dismissing the idea that its fate reflected infighting among china 's senior leaders . `` the censors eventually acted as expected , after going through this bureaucratic process that is always half a step behind . '' as gusty winds blew away beijing 's smog sunday afternoon , this much became clear to the public : in china , the government cares about the environment as much as you do , but only one of you is free to talk about it .

'' li held the highly choreographed annual press conference -- often the only occasion a senior chinese leader faces the media -- after china 's __rubber-stamp__ parliament approved the government budget and concluded this year 's 10-day session . li answered questions from __pre-selected__ journalists that focused on the economy and touched on the government 's stance on the anti-corruption campaign , the environment and foreign policy . before he was ushered out of the ornate room , the premier responded to a question shouted from the audience about myanmar , whose warplanes reportedly dropped a bomb friday in a chinese border town and killed four civilians . `` we have the responsibility and capability to firmly safeguard the stability of the __chinese-myanmar__ border -- and will firmly protect the lives and property of our citizens , '' li said to applause from chinese reporters .

'' hernandez has been charged with murder and has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of lloyd , a __semipro__ football player who was found dead in massachusetts on june 17 , 2013 . hernandez also has pleaded not guilty to a gun and ammunition charge . his co-defendants , ernest wallace and carlos ortiz , also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately . kraft testified that he asked to speak with hernandez in an office near a weight room in the stadium , and asked the player to look him in the eye and tell him if he was involved in lloyd 's death . according to kraft , hernandez told him during that meeting that he hoped the time of lloyd 's death `` came out , '' because hernandez had been at a club that night . according to testimony from hernandez 's fiancée , shayanna jenkins , the player had not been at a club , but was at dinner with her and some friends before the shooting . mel robbins , a cnn legal analyst , called kraft 's testimony `` explosive . '' `` what a great , great witness for the prosecution , '' she said . `` basically what happened is aaron hernandez lied to his boss . and the only way you __rebut__ it is if you put him on the stand . '' how did hernandez know when the murder happened , robbins asked , unless he was there ? the patriots ' owner also testified , when asked by a defense attorney , that he 'd never had any problems with hernandez , and that the player was always respectful to him . the billionaire magnate of the kraft group , a company with interests ranging from paper and packaging concerns to sports and entertainment , said hernandez always greeted him with a hug and kiss . asked by the defense why hernandez was signed to a $ 40 million long-term contract , kraft said simply : `` he 's a very good player . '' at times during his 30 minutes or so on the witness stand , kraft seemed uncomfortable . `` do you work ? '' bristol county district attorney william mccauley asked kraft . `` i think so , yes . '' asked where he worked , kraft responded , 1 patriot place , or gillette stadium , where the super bowl champions play their home games . `` what do you do for work ?

ARTICEL:     barrington , new hampshire -lrb- cnn -rrb- u.s. sen. ted cruz was delivering his normal rhetoric during a new hampshire speech on sunday , hitting the current administration on the economy , obamacare and national security . `` and the __obama-clinton__ foreign policy of leading from behind -- the whole world is on fire , '' the senator from texas declared . but he was stopped by a 3-year-old girl sitting in the front row . `` the world is on fire ? '' she yelled out . cruz took it and ran with it . `` the world is on fire -- yes ! your world is on fire , '' he exclaimed , seizing the moment as the crowd burst out into laughter . `` but you know what ? your mommy 's here and everyone 's here to make sure that the world you grow up in is even better . '' the scene -- while cute -- captured cruz 's determination to remain unwavering in his views and language , never backtracking . there was no `` just kidding '' or `` that was only a metaphor '' to assuage the little girl . instead , the first-term senator continued with his __speechifying__ and used the moment to illustrate his point that while things are bad now , they could get better -- especially , cough cough , if he becomes president . a woman who identified herself as the child 's mother named michelle later told the __wrko__ 's __kuhner__ report that her child 's reaction came in a `` high question kind of voice , '' but that her daughter was `` quite happy '' in the aftermath . `` she really , basically was like ` oh , oh , this is a great man . ' he 's the firefighter in her mind as a three-year-old . and was quite happy and she wanted a cookie . '' cruz is bringing the resolute __disruptor__ brand that he 's built in congress out on the trail as he lays the groundwork for a white house bid . this weekend , he was on a two-day swing through new hampshire , stopping sunday afternoon at an event put on by the __strafford__ county gop . in the same way cruz challenges establishment republicans in the senate , he 's trying to build a campaign that breaks from the mold and showcases his firebrand conservatism . for example , his first question from the audience came from a woman who wanted to know how cruz was going to make campaign finance reform a reality , a huge issue in the __first-in-the-nation__ primary state . but cruz argued that not only is money a form of speech , it __emboldens__ speech . `` the answer is not to muzzle citizens ; it 's to empower citizens across the country , '' he said . throwing a bone to his __questioner__ , however , he said he supports requiring that campaign donations be disclosed . he took the same steadfast approach last weekend in iowa , when he and other contenders were asked about the ethanol mandate requiring that gasoline contain a certain amount of ethanol -- a popular regulation in iowa where corn is king . while nearly every other potential candidate expressed at least some measure of support for the mandate , cruz flatly opposed it , saying in front of close to a thousand iowa farmers that he does n't think the government should be involved in the private sector . gov. scott walker , who 's vying with jeb bush for frontrunner status , said he supported the mandate in iowa , despite previously opposing it in his home state of wisconsin . asked by reporters sunday about accusations that walker is a __flip-flopper__ , cruz first praised his potential rival but made sure to mention that candidates need to be challenged on their actions . `` it 's easy for candidates to give an answer , '' he said , but added : `` the proof is in the pudding . what i 've urged republicans to ask of every candidate is : have you walked the walk ? show me your record . '' cruz got heavy applause when he said he wanted to `` repeal every word of common core , '' a set of testing standards that jeb bush staunchly defended when he appeared at a nearby event in dover , new hampshire just two days earlier . common core , however , was not legislation approved by congress . rather , it was created by a bipartisan group of governors and state leaders , and states received financial incentives by the government to adopt the standards . still , cruz played somewhat coy with his white house aspirations , aware of the tight federal regulations that would start holding contenders to different standards once they admit they 're running for president . when voters pressed him sunday to make a white house bid , cruz told them to `` stay tuned . '' `` i 'm looking at it very , very seriously , '' he told the audience . `` i would point out a week ago i was in iowa , yesterday i was in south carolina , and today i 'm in new hampshire . '' but he truly charmed the crowd when he said that after he and his wife got their daughters a puppy recently , one of the girls gave her approval for cruz 's presidential aspirations . `` if you win , that means snowflake will finally get a backyard to pee in , '' his daughter said , according to cruz . in terms of energy and turnout , sunday 's event stood out from other events held by potential white house contenders who were in new hampshire this weekend , in part because it was open to the public , unlike other events headlined by walker and bush . his remarks were met with boisterous applause , and he was frequently urged to run for president by people who shook his hand before and after the event . halfway through cruz 's remarks , a small-business owner in the audience was called on to ask a question but instead stood up proudly next to the senator and went off into a two-minute rant about how other republicans in washington are n't representing their conservative constituents . `` it is d-day in america folks , '' he said , getting the crowd on their feet . `` we ca n't wait for another republican . we need ted cruz . '' the man said his wife wrote a blank check for cruz and pulled out his wallet , only to throw it on the ground at cruz 's feet . `` for those who believe in miracles , this gentleman just threw his wallet at a politician , '' cruz said , getting a big laugh from the crowd . `` and he actually got it back . '' cruz could not accept the money because he 's not yet a candidate . one man , bill higgins , stood outside in the snow for four hours hoping cruz would meet his goat named __izak__ , an apparent fixture on the campaign trail which was wearing a hat that said `` i voted '' and who happened to bite jon huntsman in 2011 . cruz waved hello at higgins as the senator exited the building sunday afternoon but did n't stop to greet the goat . `` he 'll be back again , '' higgins said , trying to appear unfazed . `` i 'm sure he wants to get to his next stop . ''

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- when it comes to the u.s. fraternity and sorority system , it 's a disturbing truth : life is largely segregated by race , money and power ; and , yet , most of us find that unsurprising . this week , however , we got more evidence this callous status quo needs to change . the push came in the form of a __nine-second__ youtube video , which i 'm sure you 've seen by now . it reportedly shows members of the sigma alpha epsilon fraternity at the university of oklahoma chanting these chilling lines : `` there will never be a ni **** __sae__ . you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me . '' `` the students on the bus clap and pump their fists as they __boisterously__ chant , '' cnn 's eliott c. mclaughlin writes , describing a clip that rocketed around social media , leading ou 's president , david boren , to rightfully shutter and ban that fraternity from the school . the video is hard to watch , but i have a feeling it 's one we need to see , both because it hints at the inner workings of certain greek organizations , and because it shows the persistent racism that still exists in the united states . i 'm thankful someone -- someone who was on the bus to witness the racist chants -- was brave enough to film this and to help it become public . that alone should give some reason for hope . others were n't , but i was shocked by the video . this , in 2015 ? in my home state ? both of my parents participated in greek life in oklahoma , but at a different university . i know from their stories that these groups can be the basis for lifelong friendships and civic engagement . what happened on the bus at ou does n't negate their positive experiences . but it should cause us to question a system that is inherently built around the concept of exclusion . sometimes students are excluded from greek life , in theory , because they 're seen as __uncool__ or do n't `` fit in '' with a particular chapter . but we 'd be kidding ourselves if we did n't realize that , often , a person 's race -- or sexual orientation , for that matter -- factors into this you 're - in , you 're - out process . oklahoma school 's response to video caught between racism , civil rights act . and it 's hard for me not to see the __sae__ video as a manifestation -- an admittedly extreme one -- of this __exclusionist__ ideology . this is a case of dangerous __group-think__ run amok . in a system that remains largely divided by race , perhaps videos like this should n't be so surprising . that 's the view of matthew __hughey__ , an associate professor of sociology at the university of connecticut who studies racial dynamics in american greek life . the u.s. fraternity and sorority system is `` a form of american apartheid , '' he told me in an interview on monday . instead of thinking of the oklahoma fraternity members as `` bad apples , '' he said , we should see them as part of a `` bad orchard . '' that orchard includes , but is n't limited to , greek organizations , he told me . it also includes the rest of us and our country 's racist history . `` largely , these organizations reflect a __supersegregated__ and unequal system that is made up of college and alumni members all over the world , '' he said . sigma alpha epsilon is no stranger to scandal and sanctions . comparative data on the racial make-up of these organizations is impossible to come by , but anecdotal evidence suggests these groups are starkly divided by race . from 2003 to 2006 , __hughey__ spent time interviewing students from greek organizations at three colleges on the east coast . `` at the time of interviews , the average membership size of the organizations was 63 members , and there was an average of 2.4 __nonwhite__ members per organization , '' he wrote in a 2010 paper published by society for the study of social problems . that 's 3.8 % minority members , in those instances . __hughey__ 's sample size is small but his results also echo what anyone who 's spent time on a college campus knows to be true : there are white fraternities and there are black ones . sometimes we even dare call them that . far too many of us , especially those of us with friends and family members who have participated in greek life , either are in denial about this -- or we choose to see egregious cases of racism , sexism and violence in the u.s. greek system as somehow isolated . it 's clear that 's not the case . `` in 1992 , texas a&m university fined its chapter $ 1,000 after it threw a ` jungle party ' attended by frat brothers in blackface . then in 2002 , syracuse university suspended its chapter after one of its members went to a bar in blackface . as recently as 2013 , the fraternity got suspended following allegations it had photographed african american students while pledges recited rap lyrics laced with racial slurs , '' according to the washington post 's terrence mccoy . all of that was just __sae__ . other examples are easy to come by , too . according to the new york daily news , here 's the text of an invitation to a 2013 __asian-themed__ kappa sigma party at duke university : `` we look forward to having mi , yu , you and yo friends over for some sake . __chank__ you . '' and in january 2014 , according to the new york times , arizona state university investigated an __mlk-day__ party hosted by the tau kappa epsilon fraternity in which `` __nonblack__ students mocked blacks by donning loose basketball jerseys , flashing gang signs and drinking from __hollowed-out__ __watermelons__ . '' it 's clear there is a recurring problem here -- one that needs fixing . one easy place to start would be simply getting more information . why do n't universities force these organizations to report their demographics so we can see exactly how segregated this system really is ? __hughey__ told me that data is n't available . then we could know the answers to some interesting questions : how segregated are greek organizations ? are certain schools or organizations more integrated than others ? what 's the trend over time ? is there progress ? john lewis on oklahoma students : ` they should be gone ' universities also should assess how and why they support these organizations . do traditionally black and latino fraternities get as much school funding and attention as the white __frats__ ? if not , why ? and why are these groups so incredibly divided in the first place ? what does that do to the student body as a whole ? i 'm not calling for an end to the greek system . but it 's a system that needs to take a hard look in the mirror and make some real changes . `` any time there are racist remarks made , we must speak up as americans , '' boren , the ou president , said in a news conference . he added that he hopes the __sae__ students `` think long and hard '' about the incident as they pack up and vacate their fraternity house early this week . `` i hope they think long and hard about how words can injure and hurt other people , '' he said . the rest of us should do that , too .

ARTICEL:     paris -lrb- cnn -rrb- french lawmakers are weighing a ban on extremely thin models . new legislation debated in parliament tuesday would require modeling agencies to get medical certificates from models proving that their body mass index is at least 18 . models would also be required to undergo regular weight checks . and agencies that violate the law could face fines and even possible prison sentences . dr. olivier __veran__ , a doctor and french lawmaker who 's proposing the measures , said it 's time to put a stop to the practice of pressuring models to be so thin that it 's dangerous for their health . `` we want to combat the idea that an agency could urge a model to stop eating ; for example eating cotton balls to lose their appetite , to always lose more weight , '' he said . seeing models ' bones as they parade down the catwalk is a troubling trend , __veran__ said . `` we have had chief editors of prestigious magazines tell us that more and more often , they are obliged to use photoshop , not to make the models look slimmer , '' he said , `` but to erase the tracks of bones under the skin , to make them look bigger . '' __vernan__ 's proposed amendments to a health bill would also target the dark online world of __pro-anorexia__ websites that promote __self-starvation__ and encourage young women to post photos of their emaciated frames . the average bmi for a woman in france is __23.2__ -- the lowest average in western europe , according to a 2009 study from france 's national institute of demographic studies . in france , __veran__ said , __30,000-40__ ,000 people suffer from eating disorders , mainly teenagers . __marisol__ __touraine__ , france 's minister of social affairs , expressed her support for the new __anti-anorexia__ measures in an interview with cnn affiliate bfmtv . `` the approach is good , '' she said , adding that the government will have to examine the wording of the new legislation in further detail . extreme cases such as that of french model isabelle caro have sparked calls for change for years . caro died in 2010 , three years after she posed nude in a controversial ad campaign against anorexia . similar concerns in spain , italy and israel prompted those countries to adopt laws against the use of __ultra-thin__ models on catwalks and in advertising campaigns . israel even has strict rules on how model 's bodies are photoshopped ; any changes must be clearly marked on the photo . some in the industry are supportive of the proposed laws , but say they do n't strike at the real issue . `` the fact of the matter is , fashion creatives have to think about the messaging they are promoting around body image ideals and the fact they are __normalizing__ an __unachievable__ physical appearance , '' said __caryn__ franklin , a fashion commentator . __veran__ 's legislation is set to go before the french parliament at the end of the month for discussion . and he wants to outlaw what he calls starving models by the end of the year . `` i think that by the end of 2015 , '' he said , `` we will no longer have anorexic models on the catwalk . '' cnn 's catherine e. shoichet contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- korean air 's `` nut rage '' case has made its way back to new york , with the flight attendant who served the offending __macadamia__ nuts filing a lawsuit against the airline and a former executive . heather cho , a korean air executive and daughter of the airline 's chairman , is serving a one-year prison sentence in south korea after throwing a fit on a new york flight because her nuts were served in a bag instead of a porcelain bowl . in a civil suit filed this week in state supreme court in queens , new york , cho -- whose name is listed as heather __hyun__ __a-cho__ in court documents -- is accused of `` verbally and physically '' attacking flight attendant kim __do-hee__ in december on a __seoul-bound__ flight departing from john f. kennedy international airport . at the time , cho , who was seated in first class , demanded that the plane go back to the gate so kim could be kicked off the flight , according to the lawsuit . the episode , which was widely reported , was a `` prime example of the corrupt and entitled behavior of the members of elite south korean business families , '' the lawsuit states . the suit describes cho as the `` princess '' of the `` so-called royal '' family that controls korean air , and says the executive screamed obscenities at kim before hitting , shoving and threatening the flight attendant . on her return to south korea , the lawsuit states , kim was `` pressured to lie to government regulators in order to cover up the incident , and to appear in public with cho as part of an orchestrated effort to try and rehabilitate cho 's public image . '' a south korean judge last month said that cho 's actions threatened the development of the aviation industry and inconvenienced passengers , and ruled that she violated aviation law , changed a flight path and interfered with operations . she was sentenced to a year in jail . the judge blasted cho for her conduct , saying that she had used the plane as if it were her personal car and that as a passenger , she could not override crew members and give orders during a flight . the case is emblematic of growing resentment over the perceived privileges and nepotism of the families that control the country 's top companies . cho resigned as vice president at the company a few days after the incident and publicly apologized , saying she accepted `` full responsibility . '' last month , she appeared in a south korean court wearing a green prison uniform . she gazed downward . her hair hung in her face . `` i do n't know how to find forgiveness , '' she said . park __chang-jin__ , the chief steward who was booted from the flight instead of kim , has said the former executive treated crew members like `` __feudal__ slaves . '' park and kim , the flight attendant who served the nuts , had knelt in front of cho in apology . kim testified that cho berated them about the service and later shoved and cursed her . when the flight arrived in korea , the flight attendant said another airline manager , yeo __woon-jin__ , pressured her not to talk to investigators about cho 's physically abusing her and park . yeo was found guilty of interfering with an investigation . korean air chairman cho __yang-ho__ apologized to the flight attendants and the public following the public uproar over the incident . in a statement , kim 's lawyer , andrew weinstein , called heather cho 's behavior `` humiliating , degrading , and damaging to ms. kim , but ... also emblematic of ms. cho 's unbridled arrogance and disturbing sense of entitlement . '' the incident has damaged kim 's `` career , reputation , and emotional well-being , '' and efforts to settle the case out of court have been unsuccessful , according to the statement -- which did n't specify how much was being sought in damages . attempts to reach representatives of korean air as well as lawyers for cho were unsuccessful . cnn 's david __shortell__ contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the news that the u.s. military will charge army sgt. bowe bergdahl with desertion for abandoning his post in afghanistan __revives__ a deeply disturbing and morally wrenching incident in america 's troubled war in afghanistan . from the moment last year that the world learned about the __prisoner-swap__ deal that secured his freedom , the questions that surrounded __begdahl__ 's disappearance gained significance . after all , the united states had agreed to a very high price for his release . based on the evidence that has come to public light , desertion seems the right charge against bergdahl , whose comrades say he walked away , abandoning his commitments as a soldier in a war and creating new and greater dangers for them . but even before the charges were filed , there were other question whose answers are emerging . was the united states right to negotiate a __high-price__ trade ? did `` leave no man behind '' trump `` no negotiating with terrorists '' ? and if it did , did the importance of saving one man outweigh the dictate not to pay ransom even if that man was a traitor or a deserter ? new information about his disappearance and life of the people freed in exchange for bergdahl make the case all the more troubling . bergdahl , you will recall , spent five years as a prisoner of the haqqani network , a group allied with the taliban organization , america 's principal enemy in afghanistan . taliban fighters had captured him in june 2009 , just after bergdahl , apparently disenchanted with the military , left his post in southeastern afghanistan . the taliban handed the american soldier to the __haqqanis__ , who shuttled him between locations as they and their partners negotiated for his release , seeking to maximize the profit from their valuable captive . in may 2014 they struck a deal . five taliban commanders were flown out of the u.s. prison at guantanamo bay , freed in exchange for the american soldier whose disappearance many had already labeled a desertion . the images became iconic . a strikingly pale bergdahl , blinking painfully against the bright sun as he was handed over to u.s. officials . the scene contrasted sharply with a video of the taliban chiefs ' receiving a heroes ' welcome in qatar , where they prepared for a new life after their american captivity . national security adviser susan rice said bergdahl had served with `` honor and distinction . '' if that had been the case , the trade would have proved much less controversial . but from the moment bergdahl went missing there had been questions . in the letters he wrote home before vanishing , bergdahl showed a steady erosion of his faith in the military and belief in the mission . `` the future is too good to waste on lies , '' he told his parents . `` and life is way too short to care for the __damnation__ of others . '' men who had served with bergdahl said he had simply walked off the base carrying little more than a compass . not only would such a move constitute __near-suicidal__ foolishness , it also put his comrades in great danger , particularly as they set out on a desperate quest to find him . what has been the cost of bergdahl 's odyssey ? some said the search for him cost the lives of six american soldiers . the specific circumstances are complicated , but it is clear that the six died in paktika province in the months after bergdahl vanished , during a period in which every mission , even if not directly aimed at finding bergdahl , included some element of a search . as one former team leader told cnn , `` when those soldiers were killed , they would not have been where they were if bergdahl had not left . '' one of them , 2nd lt __darryn__ andrews , received a posthumous silver star for saving the lives of five soldiers during a mission that had shifted from searching for a taliban target to looking for bergdahl . andrews left behind a pregnant wife and a 2-year-old son . then there is the cost of signaling to the taliban , of telling all of america 's enemies , that if they capture a u.s. service member they could trade him for a ransom . this could endanger other americans . and there is another potential cost : the men who were freed in exchange for bergdahl could go on to fight again . the more you learn about the details of their __post-guantanamo__ lives , the more distressing the transaction looks . under the terms of the deal , qatar agreed to keep the former prisoners from leaving the country for one year . in the meantime , they are said to be living a life of fantastic comfort and luxury , courtesy of their gracious qatari hosts . according to reports , they have each been allowed to bring five more families to keep them company . the 35 taliban households are living in the lap of qatari luxury , but the fighters are getting restless . at least two of the former guantanamo detainees reportedly want to go back to the battlefield , perhaps adding to the eventual tally of the bergdahl transaction . now bergdahl will face his punishment ; he could be sentenced to life in prison for what the military says was desertion and misbehavior , and what his comrades said was a shameful betrayal -- one that cost lives . the question remains , should the united states have traded for this man ? my sense is that the united states has a duty to the soldiers it sends to war . all soldiers should know that their country will do what it takes to bring them back . america could not leave bergdahl to die in a mountain cave , especially if it did not know with certainty the circumstances of his disappearance -- but even if it did . whether the obama administration negotiated as effectively as it could have is another matter . on that count , i am skeptical . the trade -- bergdahl for several hardened prisoners -- was a __heart-splitting__ dilemma , but it was the right call .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     frida ghitis : desertion charges against bowe bergdahl revive questions : was swap deal for him correct ? what has his odyssey cost ? she says swap may have sent dangerous message to america 's enemies , cost american lives . still , retrieving u.s. soldier was right call .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- from the moment we are born , the first question our parents are asked is , `` is it a boy or a girl ? '' the answer to that seemingly simple question quickly establishes the child 's path and trajectory for years to come ; however , the question is not simple . the question is tragically flawed and here 's a __newsflash__ for everyone who has ever asked new parents that question : you 're asking the wrong people . i realize that parents are simply sharing a bit of biological information based on their baby 's physical `` parts , '' but only that beautiful baby can accurately and __authentically__ tell you what gender he or she is . you may want to give it a little time before you paint that nursery bright pink or pick out junior 's first baseball glove -- it 's just not that simple . i may only be 15 years old and will be the first to admit that i know very little about this great big world , but i know way too much about gender and being __mislabeled__ . why transgender teen jazz jennings is everywhere . you see , the doctor told my parents , `` it 's a girl , '' but he could n't have been more wrong . aside from my biology , i knew i was a boy from the age of 2 . i was 100 % sure of who i was and biology was an insignificant part of the conversation . keep in mind that this was a time before i had even realized that being a boy trapped in a girl 's body was anything beyond normal , and this was long before i could possibly articulate what was happening . however , there was no need to articulate anything . i was a little boy expressing myself based on what was in my heart and mind -- not yet distorted by biology , other people 's confusion , or fear . it was when i was older that other people let me know something was `` off . '' no matter how many times i was told differently , i was a boy and the people that mattered knew it too , for the most part . i want to address the moment where people , gender , and respectful communication part ways . that is the moment when the word `` sexuality '' creeps into the conversation . that is when people get scared , cite religion , start whispering , and disconnect . it 's a sad moment , but i get it . people have always mocked what they do n't understand , and this is a tough one for most to grasp . that said , it has to change and i believe it is changing . the transgender life : what to know , say and understand . i can not stress to the world enough , gender and sexuality are two completely different things , and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight . save your fear people . this is not something to be afraid of ; it 's an opportunity for us to evolve . nothing is completely black or white , hot or cold , here or there , or male and female ; there are varying degrees of everything and the quicker we respect that , the faster we all grow and allow people to be who they are . it all starts by taking sexuality out of the initial conversation . i first heard the term `` gay '' in the second grade , long after i had my first `` girlfriend '' and had proudly written `` a penis '' at the top of my christmas list . not until after i learned that there was such a thing as sexuality and homosexuality did i become afraid of who i was . it was n't until i learned that there were people out there that considered homosexuality `` abnormal '' or that people needed to put labels on our feelings toward others that i became terrified that i was `` different . '' i knew i liked girls and i was technically a girl , biologically , but i was a boy and my feelings about girls were normal boy feelings . i was not gay -- but try to explain that to someone without his or her eyes glazing over . thankfully , i grew up in a household that taught me that i could love anybody i wanted to and it was fine because it is fine . anyone can love anyone and there is nothing wrong with that . fortunately , people have developed more of an understanding of that over time , but there are always going to be people that think differently and we all have to accept that . do they matter ? of course they do because we all matter , equally ; however , ignorant people are here to help us learn how to better communicate ; everyone is reachable with the right circumstances and i look forward to the battles as much as the victories . as long as you 're happy , you 're indestructible . that said , i knew being gay was n't a bad thing , but i also knew it did n't describe me . i was a straight boy who liked girls and there is nothing wrong with that , either . i was afraid of being thought of differently . the most crippling fear came from people not understanding that i was a boy trapped in a girl 's body and simply labeling me something i 'm not . that 's what i was truly afraid of . experience how one family reacted when their daughter said she 's a boy . cnn films presents `` raising __ryland__ , '' a short film available exclusively on cnn digital on wednesday , march 18 . discovering that i was transgender was a miraculous moment . i finally found the key that unlocked the cage i 'd been trapped in for 14 years and that 's why i call this journey , `` my __transcension__ . '' with the support of my parents , i am sharing my story . breaking free and owning your sexuality is something you find within yourself and is spectacular , but it is just the tiniest part of the greater transgender conversation . i am going beyond that and my journey is one that is constantly moving forward and upward . i 'm taking the body i was born into and transforming it into the body i know i 'm supposed to be in -- thanks to my family , friends , dr. jo olson , the support groups , the science , and lastly , myself . see , that 's the irony , i was the first person and truly the only person capable of answering the `` is it a boy or girl '' question -- not the doctor , my parents , or anyone who thinks they know better . that is the lesson , let each of us dictate our own path and respect everyone 's choice . i realize that it 's easier said than done but if you read this and find yourself open to a new conversation about gender , i consider that a win for us all . truthfully , i 'm most proud of myself for having the courage to find my own way and owning it , to proudly begin my __transcencion__ from someone i was n't -- into the man i always knew i 'd become . whether i 'm a boy or a girl , white or black , rich or poor , gay or straight , it 's completely irrelevant . what truly matters is the fact that i 'm avery wallace and i 've always known exactly who i was . i 'm here to share my journey and hopefully , help someone else recognize theirs .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     avery wallace says he knew he was a boy from age 2 . `` i knew being gay was n't a bad thing , but i also knew it did n't describe me , '' avery says . people mock what they do n't understand , he says .

ARTICEL:     havana , cuba -lrb- cnn -rrb- so what has u.s. state department subcontractor alan gross been up to since he was released from a cuban prison exactly three months ago ? it turns out a lot more than most of the rest of us . gross , 65 , has started to make up for the five years he spent imprisoned in cuba by traveling abroad , attending the state of the union address as a guest of the obamas and last week meeting pope francis at the vatican to personally thank him for his role in helping to win gross ' freedom . after five years of being disconnected from the outside world , gross now frequently posts on social media , writing of family reunions , eating the foods he longed for in prison and the reminders he experiences of his time in cuba . `` i ca n't get away from cuba , '' gross wrote after hearing a cuban song playing in an airport on his travels . while visiting israel , he posted a photo of __cohiba__ cigars advertised for sale in a tel aviv tobacco shop . in 2009 , gross was arrested by cuban state security agents and eventually sentenced to 15 years in prison for importing banned communications equipment to the island . gross said he was merely helping the island 's small jewish community get online , but cuban officials accused of him being part of a u.s. government plot to destabilize the island 's __single-party__ communist government . cuba has highly restricted internet access , and most people are not able to access the web in their homes or on their phones . on december 17 , 2014 , gross was freed , along with three cuban intelligence agents and a cuban man convicted of spying for the united states . it was part of a deal between the cuban and u.s. governments to __reestablish__ diplomatic relations after five decades of cold war animosity . gross , his wife , judy , his attorney and three u.s. congressmen flew from havana to his home state of maryland aboard a u.s. military jet , one of the smaller versions of air force one used to transport president barack obama . the image of gross celebrating his freedom aboard the flight home with cnn reporting the news of his release on a tv screen in the background became the picture he would use on his __@alanpgross__ twitter page . the night of his release , he enjoyed a meal of spicy thai food with family and friends , a far cry from the bland rations he was forced to eat in prison . in january , gross changed the status of his facebook page to read that he had left his job as `` hostage '' at the carlos finlay military hospital where had been held in havana . later , he shared pictures of a visit to the dentist 's office to replace the teeth that he lost while he was held in cuba . with his dental concerns met , he moved on to food . gross also recounted __savoring__ __long-denied__ bowls of chili and bagels loaded with __lox__ and cream cheese . many of the posts are the daily __jottings__ of a man returning to his life after an extended absence : gross renewing an expired driver 's license or visiting a starbucks for the first time in five years . but in other posts , he writes about taking in a sunset on the beach in israel , seeing the snow fall in washington and believing citizens in every country should have __unimpeded__ access to the internet . a spokeswoman for gross turned down a cnn request for an interview with him but confirmed that the social media accounts are his . rep. chris van hollen , the democrat representing the maryland district gross hails from , called it `` incredibly moving '' that a man who spent five years in a cuban prison has since sat next to first lady michelle obama and met the pope . more than that , he 's come to signify the changing dynamics between officials in washington and havana . `` alan did not ask for this special role in history , '' van hollen said , `` but he 's become a catalyst for this new chapter in american and cuban relations . '' the photos that gross posted online show a smiling man , slowly putting back on some of the 100 pounds he lost in prison , no longer the __gaunt-faced__ , __hollow-eyed__ prisoner who had gone on hunger strikes to protest his conditions while he was held in cuba . `` the distance we 've come since december 17th 2014 has been a rewarding journey , '' gross wrote in a facebook post saturday . `` for which we 're grateful . ''

ARTICEL:     leicester , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- richard iii , the king found beneath a car parking lot , has been reburied in a solemn but celebratory service , 530 years after his death in battle . the remains of the medieval monarch were sensationally rediscovered beneath a blanket of tarmac in the center of leicester in august 2012 . they have been pored over by scientists at the city 's university ever since , but after more than two years of legal __wranglings__ , the bones were finally laid to rest thursday in a coffin built by richard iii 's distant relative , michael __ibsen__ , whose dna helped prove their identity . it was standing __room-only__ at leicester cathedral -- which had been partially rebuilt for the occasion -- as archbishop of canterbury justin welby led prayers for the __long-dead__ king , swinging incense and sprinkling holy water over the casket , before scattering it with earth from key locations marking his birth , life and death . oscar-nominated actor benedict cumberbatch , a distant cousin of england 's last plantagenet king , read a poem dedicated to richard iii , written by poet laureate carol ann duffy . `` my bones , scripted in light , upon cold soil , a human braille . my skull , scarred by a crown , emptied of history . describe my soul as incense , __votive__ , vanishing ; your __ownthe__ same . grant me the carving of my name . '' queen elizabeth , represented at the ceremony by the countess of wessex , sent a special message to mark the __reinterment__ , which she hailed as `` an event of great national and international significance . '' `` today we recognize a king who lived through turbulent times and whose __christan__ faith sustained him in life and death , '' it read . but though it bore many of the hallmarks of grief -- polished coffin , empty tomb , relatives clad in gloomy , __pitch-dark__ suits -- this was not , the organizers insisted , a sad occasion . `` this is not a funeral at which we mourn , '' said professor gordon campbell , of the university of leicester , welcoming the congregation to the cathedral , just yards from that famous parking lot . instead , the aim of the service was to offer richard iii a fitting farewell , and a lasting memorial -- neither of which he was granted following his death at bosworth in 1485 . back then , his body was slung over a horse and carried back to leicester -- legend has it that his head struck bow bridge on the way -- before being put on display for three days , to prove to friends and foes alike that he really was dead , before being slung into a __hastily-dug__ grave at the church of the grey friars . now richard 's bones , accompanied by a __specially-crafted__ rosary , recognizing his catholic faith , rest in a __lead-lined__ coffin of english oak , his grave marked by a 2.3 ton block of pale __swaledale__ fossil limestone resting on a plinth of black __kilkenny__ marble carved with his name , dates , coat of arms , and his symbol : a white boar . speaking before the commemorations , philippa langley , founder of the `` looking for richard '' project , said she did not expect to feel upset at the __reinterment__ : `` richard died over 500 years ago , so i do n't think there will be a sense of sadness there at all . i hope there 's perhaps some joy , that something has been done well and right and that we 've made peace with the past . '' but __ibsen__ admitted he found sunday 's service at which the remains were carried in to the cathedral surprisingly moving : `` there was a slight __dampening__ of the eyeballs , which caught me completely __unawares__ , '' he said __phlegmatically__ . `` leicester born and bred '' sisters susan foster and sharon stirling were among the crowds waiting outside the cathedral to listen in on the service and catch a glimpse of the guests arriving . `` this is history , is n't it , it 's never going to happen again , '' said foster . `` we grew up with all the stories of richard iii . we lived close to bow bridge , so we know all the legends about him . '' stirling said she thought the richard iii story would be a big bonus for the city : `` i think it will boost the economy and bring visitors in -- he 's got quite a fan club , after all . '' leicester has always been proud of its links to richard iii ; the city boasts pubs and schools named in his honor , there 's a walking tour and a brand new visitor center built over his original grave . but in recent days , interest has risen to fever pitch : shop windows are full of __richard-themed__ displays offering everything from wooden toy castles to chain mail __jewelery__ . the florist around the corner from the cathedral is doing a roaring trade in white roses , which people have been leaving at richard iii 's statue , and his face is emblazoned on all manner of souvenirs , from __paperweights__ and pens to mugs and bars of chocolate . there 's even a `` return of the king '' beer -- locally brewed and promising `` a distinctive regal flavor . '' some 35,000 people lined the __bunting-and-flag-draped__ streets of leicester and its surrounding villages on sunday to watch as the king 's coffin was carried in a procession out to the scene of his death and back again . another 20,000 lined up for hours to file past the casket and pay their respects as it lay `` in __repose__ '' at the cathedral in the days since , watched over by an honor guard of veterans . among them was jane gregory , who traveled two hours by bus from her home in south derbyshire twice in a week to be there . `` it was just something i had to see and experience -- it 's part of history , '' she told cnn outside the __reburial__ service on thursday . `` i came on monday too , to view the coffin -- it was a great experience . i queued for two and a half hours and it was worth every minute . '' history enthusiast paul eames stood in the drizzle and watched the service on his ipad after missing out on a ticket -- to his wife karen : `` i applied for tickets for both of us ; i could have cried when i saw the envelope with her name on it . '' `` i did n't originally want to go , '' karen admitted , smiling . `` but he told me ` you 'll be part of history , you do n't realize ! ' the service was amazing , really lovely . '' not everyone was there just to celebrate richard iii , though . leicester student sherry xie said she was `` proud '' of her university 's role in the discovery of his bones , but she and her classmate wendy jiang admitted they 'd come along with an ulterior motive : `` to see benedict ! '' in his sermon , the bishop of leicester , tim stevens said those who had joined the commemorations '' -lrb- came -rrb- not to judge , condemn or praise , but to stand in silent , humble and __reverent__ __attentiveness__ at the meeting place of time and eternity . '' stevens said the search for richard iii had `` broken open not just a car park , but a nation 's story . '' it also provoked bitter __quarrels__ between rival factions over where and how he should be buried , and how much scientific testing he should be subjected to . but campbell insisted that the service was held in a `` spirit of reconciliation , '' a thought echoed by stevens : `` whether we bear a white or a red rose , whether for richard or henry ... whether for leicester or york , we recognize at the graveside that all our journeys lead us to this place , where reputation counts for nothing and all human striving turns to dust . '' langley , the driving force behind the search for the king , said thursday 's service would mark the end of one chapter in the long-running saga ; but she said work to re-examine richard 's life and legacy would go on . `` it 's the conclusion to his story in that he 's been found ... and we 're laying his physical remains to rest . but in terms of richard 's story , that is only just beginning .

'' demands another , with painful simplicity . philippa , a friend of many of those who died , told cnn she was shocked by what had happened : `` i knew all of them , they were in my grade . to some i was very close . `` we had already planned things for the future , what we were going to do when they returned from their trip . it is very hard to believed that we can not do that . '' grief counselors , chaplains and psychologists have been brought in to the school to help all of those involved come to terms with the disaster . `` i 've told the students and teachers that we have to accept the sorrow and grieve , '' said __wessel__ . `` i hope we will all get through it , if we share it . '' as the world 's media descend on the town , messages of support have come flooding in too . the local newspaper is running an online book of condolence , in which people can leave messages of sympathy and `` light '' virtual candles to match the real ones flickering on the steps of the school . `` a silent hug says more than many words , '' wrote __manuela__ __donovang__ . `` wishing the families , friends and relatives strength and comfort in the difficult days and months ahead . '' in his message , __udo__ __hentschel__ said the suffering of the parents , friends and families was `` incomprehensible , unfathomable '' and offered them his condolences : `` this , the worst of all fates , will bind us all -- friends and strangers -- closer together . '' in an attempt to show that solidarity , schools across the region will share a moment of silence in memory of the dead on friday at 10:53 a.m. , the time the plane crashed . for the classmates of those who will never return , that silence will go on , as the seats they left empty remain __unfilled__ in the weeks and months to come . `` our school is no longer what it once was , '' said __wessel__ . `` in __haltern__ we had __1,283__ students . it is horrifying that now we have 16 fewer .

'' another part of the plan pledges to eliminate the widespread use of antibiotics to boost the growth of animals raised for food . it will also phase in oversight by veterinarians for other uses of antibiotics in feed and water . while applauding the spirit of the pledge , critics say the limits are still too voluntary and limited in scope . `` the problem we have with the plan is that it only removes the growth claims from the label , '' said senior analyst steve roach at keep antibiotics working . `` what we hoped for in the plan was a commitment from fda to identify which antibiotic uses other than growth promotion need to be changed . '' `` with 80 % of the antibiotics produced in the united states being used in agriculture mostly for prevention , '' said louise slaughter , d-new york , who has an alternate proposal in front of congress , `` any meaningful solution to the looming antibiotic resistance crisis must begin with limits on the farm . trusting a voluntary policy that lets industry police itself will not bring about real change .

'' __copilot__ hamid , 27 , reportedly once invited a woman and her friend into the cockpit on a 2011 flight between thailand and malaysia . `` that 's an enormous breach of security , '' weiss said . but investigators punched holes in the idea , saying there was no indication of a third party in the cockpit , cnn reported in april . the difference between hijacking and __commandeering__ is nuanced . the former term is often used when the hijacker issues a demand such as being taken to a __safe-haven__ country or receiving ransom to release passengers . when people __commandeer__ a plane , they might keep the motives secret , said political analyst peter bergen . they may want to steer it themselves at a target , like the september 11 , 2001 , terrorists did . in 1994 , a fedex employee burst into the cockpit of fedex flight __705__ with a hammer and spear gun . he wanted to crash the plane into the company 's memphis , tennessee , headquarters . the crew thwarted that takeover . `` __commandeering__ would fit with the few facts that we do know , and -lrb- it 's -rrb- certainly a theory that we have n't heard a lot of that is n't a conspiracy , '' bergen said . experts are divided on this theory , partly because no terrorists have claimed responsibility at a moment when they would have the world 's attention -- unless potential terrorists were waiting for something . mh370 went to kazakhstan . outlandish conjecture or genius insight ? the theory that russian actors on board mh370 found a way to get the plane through the border territory of china , pakistan and india to a kazakh landing strip leased to russia comes from science journalist and private pilot jeff wise . fleets of ships and search aircraft are looking in the wrong direction , he says . the airliner went north , not south . investigators may have misinterpreted a key component of the inmarsat satellite data . `` this is not a normal investigation . they need to throw out the book , '' wise has said . another aviation analyst , david __soucie__ , also cast doubt after mh370 went missing on the most widely held belief that the plane hit the indian ocean . `` if it had crashed in the way that we think it did , which is to run out of fuel and hit the water and break up into pieces , there would be pieces somewhere , '' he said . but michael __exner__ , an engineer with decades of experience in the mobile satellite communications industry , says the data `` accurately and __unambiguously__ '' shows mh370 went down near the so-called 7th arc , a path along which the search has been focused . `` the current atsb search strategy remains the best search strategy , '' he said . in a less sinister but equally lethal explanation , some experts __theorized__ the plane mysteriously crashed somewhere because of mechanical malfunction . perhaps the electronics died , or a fire broke out , preventing the pilots from communicating . maybe they turned to look for a landing strip but could n't steer the plane properly . pilots had trouble embracing the thought . `` i 've been running that in my brain now ever since this thing happened , '' said jim __tilmon__ , an aviation expert and retired american airlines pilot . `` one possibility would be a total electrical failure which is very , very hard to imagine because -lrb- the plane -rrb- has so many generators coming from different places , '' __tilmon__ said . if they fail , there are other __backups__ . he has said he 's never heard of anything like it happening before . for months after mh370 disappeared , malaysian officials reported details of the search to next of kin and the public . something would be spotted , hopes rose , and then it did n't pan out . hopes were dashed ; anguish returned . sunday , a year to the day after the plane disappeared , the international independent investigation committee released an interim report on the disappearance of mh370 . it found no indications of unusual behavior among the aircraft 's pilots and cabin crew before it took off , and said that zaharie had had no personal or financial problems that would cast suspicion on him . the interim report also revealed that the battery of the underwater locator beacon on the plane 's flight data recorder had expired more than a year before its disappearance . the battery on the plane 's other so-called black box , the cockpit voice recorder , had been replaced as scheduled , and remained within its expiry date , the report said . cnn 's pamela __boykoff__ and jethro mullen contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the prospect of a palestinian state is nil so long as prime minister benjamin netanyahu stays in office , netanyahu said in a monday interview . asked by an interviewer with the israeli news site , __nrg__ , if it was true that a palestinian nation would never be formed while he 's prime minister , netanyahu replied , `` indeed . '' his interview with __nrg__ came as he courted conservative supporters a day before israelis head to the polls for national elections . `` anyone who is going to establish a palestinian state , anyone who is going to evacuate territories today , is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical islam against israel , '' he said . `` this is the true reality that was created here in the last few years . '' netanyahu went on to say that any opponents on the left who might argue otherwise are `` sticking their head in the sand , time and time again . '' he further said a strong government led by his likud party is necessary to beat back international pressure to divide jerusalem and return israel to its __pre-1967__ borders , according to a jewish __telegraphic__ agency report on the __nrg__ interview . `` i do not give in , '' netanyahu told __nrg__ . `` we stood fast against huge pressure , and we will continue to do so . '' following netanyahu 's interview , chief palestinian negotiator saeb __erekat__ , who is also a member of the executive committee of the palestine liberation organization , said the israeli prime minister 's stance is nothing new . `` netanyahu has done everything possible to bury the two-state solution , '' he said . `` netanyahu 's statement at the illegal settlement of __har__ __homa__ is a response to all those governments who tried to block palestinian diplomatic initiatives . he could n't have done that without counting on full impunity from the international community . now the world must learn its lesson and understand that impunity wo n't bring peace , only justice will . '' earlier in the day , netanyahu continued his efforts to drum up support during a campaign speech in the __har__ __homa__ neighborhood of jerusalem , which he boasted that he helped establish in 1997 , during his first prime ministerial term . israel considers __har__ __homa__ part of a unified jerusalem , while palestinians consider the neighborhood an illegal settlement . if he is re-elected , netanyahu said , he will continue to promote construction in jerusalem as a means of national security , he said . `` the pressure around this decision back then was enormous . but i insisted -- i ordered the construction and it paid off , '' he said . `` today , __har__ __homa__ is a flourishing neighborhood in which tens of thousands of israeli civilians are living . as we proved in the past , my friends in the likud party and i , we will keep jerusalem protected and keep developing it . '' opposition leaders isaac herzog and __tzipi__ livni of the zionist union , he alleged , are `` ready to surrender to every dictate . '' livni , he said , has denounced previous calls for more construction in jerusalem 's jewish neighborhoods , while herzog would strive to establish a palestinian capital in east jerusalem . `` i will not let that happen , '' he said . `` my friends and i in the likud will keep jerusalem united in all its parts , and we will keep __fortifying__ it so that dividing it will not be possible and it will always remain united . we will keep developing our eternal capital . '' a vote for herzog or livni is a vote for the establishment of `` __hamastan__ , '' netanyahu said , referring to hamas , the islamist group which dominates gaza . he further alleged that his opponents would yield to international pressure and `` huge financial support coming from abroad , from left-leaning tycoons and foreign governments . '' he closed his speech saying , `` the meaning of this is simple : we will not be able to keep israel safe and secure and the terror against us that once emerged through these hills with machine guns will turn into missile fire .

'' there 's no judge , just someone who knows the parameters they 've decided for the match . the small audience is mostly made up of men , but it 's a place for women to shed the roles they play outside . `` when i saw this kind of fighting for the first time , i was quite shocked . i had never seen something like that before , and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close , '' said __mazur__ , who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school . `` __inhibition__ and fear do not exist on the mat .

ARTICEL:     hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- taipei is fast becoming the go-to asian city for some of hollywood 's biggest hitters . martin scorsese is filming his latest opus `` silence '' there , and french director luc __besson__ chose taipei over seven other asian cities for his sci-fi thriller `` lucy , '' starring scarlett johansson . and this may `` the walking dead '' star andrew lincoln will begin filming in the city for a movie project . tasked with attracting international film makers , jennifer __jao__ , head of the taipei film commission , said that 92 foreign film crews shot in the city last year , up from 56 in 2013 . `` we hope the whole island can be like a big studio , '' she told cnn while in hong kong thursday . it was n't always this way . for years , taiwan , while home to acclaimed filmmakers like edward yang and __hou__ __hsiao-hsien__ , was overlooked in favor of its __ritzier__ neighbors hong kong , shanghai and tokyo . and even when hollywood came knocking , the city did n't always have its act together . the producers of `` mission impossible iii , '' released in 2006 , had wanted to film at taipei 101 , at that time the world 's tallest skyscraper . but faced with red tape and reluctance , they ended up choosing the __53-story__ shanghai bank of china tower for tom cruise 's memorable bungee jump . `` we lost an opportunity for the world to get to know taipei , '' says __jao__ . __jao__ 's commission was set up in 2008 to court international film makers but it was n't until director ang lee , who was born in taiwan , filmed the oscar-winning hit `` life of pi '' on the island that it began to earn a reputation as an accommodating and affordable place to shoot . lee filmed the memorable and technically difficult scenes of a __shipwrecked__ boy and a tiger at a purpose-built facility at abandoned airport in the taiwanese city of __taichung__ . with its relatively unknown cityscape , taiwan can also function as a generic asian backdrop . the island , which was a japanese colony , is already being used as a stand-in for japan . japanese director __takashi__ __miike__ used taiwan 's high-speed rail system in a __bullet-strewn__ action sequence for crime drama `` shield of straw , '' which competed at the cannes international film festival . japanese rail authorities turned him away . and scorsese 's `` silence , '' due to release in 2016 , is a historic drama about two jesuit priests who travel to japan . taiwan is also a popular alternative to china , where there are many restrictions on filmmakers -- authorities can censor scripts considered politically sensitive or obscene . hong kong director john woo used both taiwan and china as locations in `` the crossing . '' dubbed china 's `` titanic , '' it focuses on a ship that sank when the nationalist government fled china for taiwan in 1949 as the communists took over -- a sensitive period in chinese history . taiwan and china are still governed separately . chinese authorities asked woo to tone down the heroics of a nationalist soldier , according to the south china morning post -- not something that taiwan would ever require , says __jao__ . the commission offers incentives for international film crews . up to $ 2 million is available per movie -- half of that as a cash subsidy . but just as important is the island 's versatility as a location , says __jao__ . while many of the film crews are from neighboring asian countries , the city has hosted crews from latvia and germany , while the bbc shot some of its newly released drama `` __x+y__ '' in the city . `` it 's a small island . within half an hour , you can go from the streets to the mountains to the sea .

'' -lrb- i -rrb- am sure that the truth will prevail and i will get a chance to put forward my case with all the facts . i have always said i am open for legal scrutiny . of course i am upset , but this is part of life , '' he said in a text message issued by his office . singh 's congress party also came to his defense . the former prime minister functioned with `` utmost __probity__ and utmost transparency '' during his term , said senior congress party leader __manish__ __tiwari__ . he said singh 's legal team would thoroughly examine the summons , and indicated it may be challenged in a higher court . the __oxford-cambridge__ educated singh has been credited with ushering in economic reforms in india as its finance minister in the 1990s . in his first term as prime minister , he initiated a historic nuclear deal with the united states that ended the south asian nation 's decades-old isolation in the global nuclear market . his second tenure was hit by the unearthing of a series of scandals spread across various sectors . in 2012 , the national auditor alleged a widespread scam in the allocation of coal blocks . india depends heavily on coal for power . the fuel is abundantly available in the country , but that 's still not enough to satisfy the demand for energy in asia 's third-largest economy . for the current financial year , national demand for thermal coal to produce energy has been estimated at __551.6__ million tonnes , according to official figures . of it , at least __84.7__ million tonnes is being met through imports , coal minister __piyush__ __goyal__ told the indian parliament in december . the state-run monopoly coal india limited -lrb- __cil__ -rrb- accounts for more than 80 % of the output . plans by current prime minister narendra modi for future privatization of the industry faced resistance recently , when __cil__ workers stopped work in january . the two-day strike -- the biggest of its kind in four decades -- not only severely limited the ability of the companies to meet their production quotas , but forced the government to go slow on reforms .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- in some ways , america 's president pilots our ship of state as a captain pilots a jumbo jet , and this analogy suggests one possible way to avoid a repeat of the __germanwings__ massacre : give the plane 's flight crew certain powers akin to those given to america 's cabinet in the rare and terrifying situation when the president and vice president are at swords ' point . some background . both presidents and plane captains must be shielded from __lunatics__ and terrorists . this is why airlines across the world hardened cockpit doors after 9/11 and why americans of all stripes are outraged by stories that the secret service on several occasions has failed to maintain proper security at the white house . both presidents and plane captains are human , and subject to all the frailties of humans , from temporary disabilities created by bathroom breaks -lrb- for pilots -rrb- and scheduled surgeries -lrb- for presidents -rrb- to sudden death . transitions in both the oval office and the cockpit should be made as smooth as possible . hence the need for a vice president at the ready , able to take over at a moment 's notice . the obvious aviation analogy here is the second pilot in the cockpit . in case of sudden death , the vice president or co-pilot simply takes over immediately . in case of a temporary disability -- say , a scheduled surgery under general anesthesia -- the president can hand over control to the vice president and then take back control when the disability ends . it is exactly what happened when president george w. bush underwent planned __colonoscopies__ in 2002 and 2007 . on both occasions , bush handed the tiller to his trusted co-pilot , dick cheney , and then resumed control when ready , under rules clearly laid out by the constitution 's 25th amendment -- an amendment drafted and ratified after the shocking assassination of president john f. kennedy . but what happens if a president is unable to predict his own future disability , or unable to recognize a genuine disability when it arises ? the 25th amendment allows the vice president to take over control in this situation , but to do so , the vice president needs the support of a majority of cabinet officers -- officials previously appointed by the president himself and thus unlikely to support any inappropriate vice presidential power grab . on a jumbo jet , a co-pilot may likewise take over in certain situations . but current airplane architecture fails to use the crew in the optimal way . when one officer has barricaded himself in the cockpit and the other officer is banging on the door demanding entry , current airplane design enables the man in the cockpit unilaterally to block the demand for entrance with the flick of a switch . think of this as an absolute veto . -lrb- some airlines get around the problem with a rule that a flight attendant must replace a pilot so that there will always be at least two people in the cockpit . -rrb- . but suppose instead that airlines were to borrow sensibly a page from america 's constitution . the man in the cockpit could temporarily block entrance , but this veto could be __overridden__ if -- and only if -- the __door-banging__ officer is backed by a majority of the flight attendants . the need for some sort of secure cockpit lock is obvious . perhaps the officer banging on the door has gone mad , or is being held hostage at knifepoint , or is a terrorist mole . but the need for an override is also obvious . perhaps the man in the cockpit is the bad guy . and just as america 's cabinet officers are __well-positioned__ to decide any dispute between a president and vice president wrestling over the key to the oval office , so too with an airplane 's crew : the cockpit lock button could be electronically __overridden__ whenever a majority of flight attendants punched in their own individual __passcodes__ in sequence on a __keypad__ somewhere outside the cockpit door . this proposed technological fix will not prevent all future tragedies . no human system is foolproof . but giving the crew a collective key brings more human minds into the equation -- as does the 25th amendment 's rule empowering the cabinet to resolve certain terrifying disputes at the highest level of executive power . on planes , as in a constitutional democracy , there is often safety in numbers .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- as a __person-of-color__ , african-american , veteran minority journalist and longtime enthusiast of all things `` daily show , '' i am of course as happy , proud and thrilled as the wife of a successful apollo astronaut over the impending ascension of trevor noah , the biracial comedian from south africa , to jon stewart 's anchor chair on what 's believed by many to be the most trusted half-hour of news and information in america . as a person who believes in fair play and equal opportunity for all , i am also moved to wonder when a woman will get the chance to preside over a talk show after sunset ? look . i do n't mean to sound ungrateful . after generations of __near-to-total__ invisibility on mass media airwaves , it 's bracing to find a whole one-hour block of high-profile cable television __infotainment__ anchored by men who look like me . indeed , in pushing forth both noah and larry wilmore , the writer , comic and __erstwhile__ national black correspondent for `` the daily show , '' to preside over both halves of comedy central 's __much-coveted__ 11 __p.m.-to-midnight__ bloc , stewart is acknowledging what the mainstream of the country truly is : i.e. not as __pale-faced__ as it once thought it was . and so far , wilmore 's `` the nightly show , '' which premiered earlier this year as a replacement for the very different `` daily show '' companion once hosted by stephen colbert , is gradually establishing its own identity as an equally cheeky hybrid of sketch satire and celebrity forum with its own multicultural flavor . still , one does wonder what happened to the groundswell of support building among `` daily show '' constituents for jessica williams , a three-year veteran of the show and an early favorite for stewart 's spot after he announced last month he was leaving . williams , who is black , tweeted back to her supporters her grateful opinion that she was `` extremely __under-qualified__ for the job . '' maybe , but what about samantha bee ? she 's the `` most senior correspondent '' for `` the daily show '' and is taking her penchant for performance artistry and provocation to tbs , where she 'll create her own __satiric__ news franchise . her track record bodes well for her prospects there . but it 's difficult to find any evidence that she was considered a stewart successor -- though her announcement that she was leaving the show came a month after stewart 's . besides bee ? no one , least of all those affiliated with comedy central , have disclosed any candidates besides noah . there was even less buzz about the stewart opening than colbert 's a year ago , during which time there were many willing to say that now was the time to finally give a woman a shot at late-night tv for the first time since the late joan rivers ' fox network effort , `` the late show '' came in 1987 -- and went in 1988 . and yes , we are n't neglecting chelsea handler , whose `` chelsea lately '' was for seven seasons on the e! network a __bawdier__ late-night alternative to whatever letterman , stewart and others were putting down beyond prime-time . she 's supposed to start streaming a new show through netflix sometime next year . so one __supposes__ she 's pretty busy . it will happen , perhaps sooner than one now expects . look how long it took before diane sawyer and katie couric were given their shots to anchor evening news broadcasts on abc and cbs respectively . hmmm ... wonder what they 're doing after 11 p.m. these days .

'' the president added , according to the official __tass__ news agency , `` the most serious attention should be paid to high-profile crimes , including those having political motives .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- buddy elias spent much of his life preserving the memory of his cousin anne frank . his death monday brought back memories for me . we met three years ago in an atlanta hotel conference room . he and his wife , __gerti__ , were touring the united states to promote a new book . i could tell instantly that he was related to anne . his face resembled hers so much that it felt almost as though i was meeting her in person . `` anne frank 's family '' had just been published , based on 14 boxes of letters , postcards , photos and documents that __gerti__ accidentally discovered in the attic of their house in basel . elias told me that it was n't just anne who loved to write ; everyone in the family did . the 6,000 recovered documents told a story of a family torn apart by war and anti-semitism . that day in atlanta , i listened to elias tell me about loved ones he lost . he told me he was lucky that his family had remained in neutral switzerland when world war ii broke out . i thought back to our conversation thursday when i learned the news of elias ' death . he died peacefully at his home in basel , switzerland , at 90 , said an announcement posted on the website of anne frank __fonds__ , the foundation that elias headed . like millions of people who read `` the diary of anne frank , '' i was deeply influenced by her words and in awe of her family 's courage . anne received her diary on her 13th birthday and wrote in it for the two years that her family hid from the nazis in the secret annex of an amsterdam apartment . i was only in seventh grade when my father bought me the book in 1975 . after the family was discovered , they were sent to auschwitz . later , anne and her sister margot were taken to __bergen-belsen__ , where they both died in march 1945 . her father , otto frank , was the sole survivor of the family , one of only 7,000 people who made it out alive from auschwitz . in the course of my two hours with elias , i learned new things about the young , jewish girl whose journal is arguably the most famous in the world . she called him bernd , short for bernhard , elias ' formal name . in his youth , elias was an actor and a skater with holiday on ice . he was her first cousin and 4 years older . they adored one another . `` bernd , maybe we can skate as a pair together someday , '' anne wrote in january 1941 from amsterdam . `` but i know i 'll have to train very hard to be as good as you are . '' in another letter , anne outlined the steps to their skating routine and drew a picture of the blue , __fur-trimmed__ dress she would wear when she finally skated with elias . `` she never did get to do that , '' elias said . on his 17th birthday in 1942 , she asked him how it was going with a girl he had met . it was an ordinary letter that one keeps like any other . but it turned out to be her last to him , and he preserved it like a relic , as proof of his cousin 's affection , as something to treasure . `` that was the last sign of life i had with anne , '' elias told me . after the war , otto frank searched frantically for his family and eventually learned their cruel fate . he published anne 's diary in 1947 and helped transform it for the stage and film . he created the foundation in her name in 1963 . the first edition of the diary was in dutch . elias told me he had to wait several years for a german language edition before he could read it . that was when he came to truly understand his childhood playmate . by the time he read her words , he had not seen anne in many years . in his mind , he treasured the image of a __spunky__ girl who loved the __jack-in-the-box__ puppet shows elias staged and played __hide-and-seek__ . `` anne , '' he said , `` was always good at hiding . '' i wondered whether he caught the irony of his own words . otto frank kept alive his daughter 's legacy until he died in 1980 and passed on that role to elias . he was devoted to the task until the day he died . in 2012 , he helped create the frank family centre in frankfurt , where archives of his extended family will be made accessible to the public , according to the anne frank foundation . elias was my closest personal encounter with a girl who opened my eyes to the cruelty of this world . anne frank never gave up on humanity , despite everything she endured . it was her goodness that amazes every reader of her diary . in elias , i saw that same goodness .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     anne frank was extremely close to her first cousin buddy elias . a discovery in elias ' attic led to the a book revealing new details about anne 's __famiy__ . elias became the __preserver__ of anne 's legacy after her father , otto frank , died in 1980 .

ARTICEL:     washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- in a strongly worded letter , the white house saturday told senate foreign relations chairman bob corker -lrb- __r-tn__ -rrb- a bill he is drafting would likely have a `` profoundly negative impact '' on the ongoing negotiations between the u.s. and iran over tehran 's nuclear program . corker is working on legislation that would force the obama administration to submit any deal reached with iran for a vote by congress . the white house earlier threatened to veto such a measure . white house chief of staff denis mcdonough , in the three page letter released publicly saturday evening , told corker his legislation could be detrimental to the talks with iran by `` __emboldening__ iranian hard-liners , inviting a counter-productive response from the iranian __majiles__ -lrb- __majles__ , the parliament -rrb- ; __differentiating__ the u.s. position from our allies in the negotiations ; and once again calling into question our ability to negotiate this deal . '' as the u.s. and iran prepare for the next round of negotiations this coming week , there has been a growing debate between republicans on capitol hill and the obama administration about how much authority congress has regarding the fate of the agreement . `` the legislation you have introduced in the senate goes well beyond ensuring that congress has a role to play in any deal with iran . instead , the legislation would potentially prevent any deal from succeeding by suggesting that congress must vote to ` approve ' any deal and by removing existing sanctions waiver authorities that have already been granted to the president , '' mcdonough wrote . the chief of staff said that only congress can terminate the existing iran sanctions that are included in laws , but the president can relax some sanctions put into place by executive order unilaterally . one of the major issues between the u.s. and iran is the timetable for lifting of the sanctions . `` if congressional action is perceived as preventing us from reaching a deal , it will create divisions within the international community , putting at risk the very international cooperation that has been essential to our ability to pressure iran . put simply , it would potentially make it impossible to secure international cooperation for additional sanctions , while putting at risk the existing multilateral sanctions '' now in place , mcdonough said in his letter . for his part , corker on sunday released a statement : `` on this issue where congress has played such a vital role , i believe it is very important that congress appropriately weigh in before any final agreement is implemented . '' corker also urged the president not to go to the united nations for a vote regarding lifting of the sanctions on iran , as reuters reported was being considered . `` enabling the united nations to consider an agreement or portions of it , while simultaneously threatening to veto legislation that would enable congress to do the same , is a direct affront to the american people and seeks to undermine congress ' appropriate role , '' he wrote . the chief of staff told corker , `` the administration 's request to the congress is simple : let us complete the negotiations before the congress acts on legislation '' and added `` we will aggressively seek public and congressional support for a deal -- if we reach one -- because we believe a good deal is far better than the alternatives available to the united states . '' mcdonough also mentioned a separate letter sent to iran 's leadership and signed by 47 republican senators . corker did not sign it . the letter maintained that a future president could reverse some of what is agreed to in these ongoing negotiations and said any agreement reached would need congressional approval . it has generated much controversy . it also drew rebuttal from iran 's foreign minister , who called it a propaganda ploy . on sunday , iran 's speaker of parliament and former nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said the letter signed by the senators tarnished washington 's reputation internationally , according to state-run __tasnim__ news agency . he said it showed that the united states is untrustworthy , and he advised current negotiators to be wary . mcdonough also said the letter 's premise was incorrect . `` non-binding agreements -- like the deal we are negotiating with iran ... are an essential element of international diplomacy and do not require congressional approval , '' mcdonough said . secretary of state john kerry , who heads back to switzerland on sunday for more talks with iranian representatives , again blasted that letter from the 47 republicans . `` it is a direct interference with negotiations in the executive department , '' he said at a news conference in egypt . `` it is completely without precedent , and it is almost inevitable it will raise questions in the minds of the folks with whom we are negotiating .

'' `` they 're extremely violent , '' he said . `` they 've been killing all sorts of religious minorities in pakistan . '' last month , the group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing outside a shiite mosque in the city of rawalpindi . bergen said dr. afridi is `` a very unpopular figure in pakistan '' because of the perception that he was involved in helping find bin laden . `` and his lawyer , by extension , would also be seen as an unpopular person because of that perception , '' he said . but bergen said he did n't think the doctor played a key role in the hunt for bin laden . `` the idea was the doctor and his staff would take dna samples from the bin laden kids as part of this ` vaccination program , ' '' he said . `` that never happened because the kids never came out . '' although dr. afridi was working for u.s. intelligence , `` the cia was n't telling the doctor , you 're helping us find bin laden , '' bergen said . after the killing of bin laden , health workers administering polio vaccinations have come to be viewed with suspicion by many pakistanis . the vaccination teams have repeatedly been targeted by militants . the latest instance came wednesday when unidentified attackers killed one polio vaccination worker and wounded another in __bajaur__ agency in northwestern pakistan , local authorities said . journalist zahir shah reported from peshawar , and cnn 's jethro mullen wrote from hong kong . cnn 's sophia __saifi__ and journalist saleem mehsud contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- it was always going to take an extraordinary performance from a very talented swimmer to beat michael phelps at his favorite event in an olympic final . for more than a decade , the great american had vanquished all __comers__ in the 200 meters butterfly on both the world and olympic stage , but then along came chad le clos . when the south african chased down phelps in the final 50 meters of the race to snatch a dramatic fingertip victory by __0.05__ seconds he created one of the defining moments of the 2012 london olympics . as a 12-year-old , le clos had gazed into his television set at home in durban watching in awe as phelps , widely regarded as the greatest swimmer of all-time , won six olympic gold medals at athens in 2004 . so perhaps it 's not surprising that lining up alongside his hero in an olympic final eight years later took on a slightly surreal air . `` my dream was always to swim like michael phelps so when i raced against him in the final it was actually a crazy feeling , '' le clos tells cnn 's human to hero series . `` when i touched at 150 -lrb- meters -rrb- i think i was 1.5 meters behind him . when i turned i actually looked at him underwater and i thought i was him -- i know it sounds absolutely crazy , but i saw myself as him going past someone else . '' `` i remembered how he used to come off the last turn and , you know , smoke everyone ... i thought , he 's done this for so many years and i remembered that when i was swimming . i do n't know what it was but it was magical . '' the __mind-altering__ moment quickly morphed into a life-changing experience for the then 20-year-old who edged out phelps in the final stroke . `` it was such a huge moment for south africa . obviously , to represent your country is a huge honor but to beat michael phelps at the olympics was amazing , '' he says . `` as a young kid everyone wants to be like their heroes but you do n't actually think one day that you 're going to beat them . '' the remarkable victory was memorable not just for le clos ' reactions -- which went from joy to disbelief immediately after the race -- but for those of his father bert , whose elated response and subsequent tv interview have become an enduring part of the swimmer 's story . the excitable tribute to his `` down-to-earth , beautiful boy , '' which included repeated mentions of the word `` unbelievable , '' touched the hearts of viewers and turned le clos senior into something of a household name himself . `` i never knew my father was such a celebrity until like five , six days after the games -- i was so wrapped up in -lrb- my own -rrb- bubble , '' le clos explains . `` we were walking down the street and everyone was taking photos of me , but i could n't find my dad , and i saw him and there were a line of people taking photos of him and i was like : ` dad ! you are stealing my thunder here . c'mon ! ' it was incredible . `` everywhere he goes he 's that famous dad and that 's amazing because he really is . nothing was put on for the cameras -- that 's how he is back home . to my other brothers and sister he 's a great dad . '' success in the pool has been rich reward for bert , who steered the chad towards swimming when a football career looked more likely . `` my parents were hugely influential in helping me make decisions throughout my life , especially my sporting career , '' he says . `` when i was young i played football until i was about 13 or 14 years old -- i played for the state team -lrb- natal -rrb- . i had to make a decision and my dad realized that i was a better swimmer , even though my family had a football background . `` __ninety-nine__ percent of fathers would have told their son to play football ... i still thank him every day for helping me make that decision . '' there is now another le clos in the pool -- teenager jordan is hoping to follow in his brother 's large footsteps , having already competed at south africa 's national championships . `` you know , 2020 is very important to me , '' says chad . `` hopefully my brother can make the olympics then and swim in the same relay team . '' originally a __breaststroker__ , le clos switched to butterfly after he tore both his abductor muscles -lrb- in the groin -rrb- in 2008 when he was 16 years old . `` butterfly movement is really different . it 's unlike freestyle or other strokes where it 's very , very technical . i compare it to dancing -- i 'm a terrible dancer ! -- it 's about getting your hips right , your kick is very important . i just really enjoy it . it 's a fast stroke , so i guess the injury was a blessing in disguise for me . '' while swimming 's toughest stroke remains his favored discipline , le clos has also struck gold in the individual 200m freestyle -- at the __short-course__ world championships in doha last year -- and the 400m medley -lrb- butterfly , backstroke , breaststroke and freestyle -rrb- at the 2010 commonwealth games in delhi . but it is butterfly where he has dominated in recent years . after __pipping__ phelps in the 200m in london , le clos had to settle for silver behind the american in the 100m , but he has n't missed a stroke since . a 100m and 200m double at the 2013 world championships in barcelona was followed by gold at the commonwealth games in glasgow , scotland last august . he capped a brilliant 2014 in december with three more titles -lrb- 50m , 100m and 200m -rrb- at the __short-course__ worlds in doha before being crowned __fina__ world male swimmer of the year -- an award he is incredibly proud of . `` the olympic gold will always be there and it will be the most outstanding moment of my life , but to win the 2014 swimmer of the year award was up there . not many people have won the ballon d'or of swimming , so it was a very special moment for me . '' for le clos , who turns 23 in april , the best is almost certainly yet to come with another olympics fast approaching . he concedes that it will be `` very , very difficult '' to get anywhere near phelps ' record haul of 18 olympic gold medals -lrb- and 22 overall -rrb- , but he may get the chance to race him one more time . phelps , who announced his retirement following the 2012 london games , made a shock return to the pool last year although things have n't exactly gone to plan -- the `` baltimore bullet '' is serving a six-month ban imposed by usa swimming after he was arrested for drink-driving last september . the ban has put his planned appearance at this year 's __fina__ world championships in doubt , but phelps is still hopeful of qualifying for his fifth olympics in 2016 . `` i really , really hope that he and his team decide to swim in rio , i really believe it will be great , '' le clos told reuters last year . `` it 's added motivation for me ... with michael back , it 's really sparked my fire , so to speak . i do n't think he will be worse in rio , i think he 'll be back where he wants to be . he 's a champion in all respects but i believe i can beat him again . '' if he can , then le clos will have taken a giant step towards his ultimate aim of swimming and sporting immortality . `` i want to cement myself in the sport as one of the greats . in swimming terms , i want people to remember chad le clos -- the guy that not only beat michael phelps , but who is the best fast swimmer of all time , '' he says . `` in south africa we have a rich history of great champions -- rugby players , cricket players , a lot of great golfers -- so i 'm among really tough competition , but i believe that after 2016 and 2020 i can hopefully be the greatest .

'' i want to return so that i can teach . as a child , i was inspired by my __third-grade__ teacher , who believed children are the future and who challenged us at that young age to create a better world . i think it 's rare for a teacher to instill this so passionately in her students , but i want to try . although i hope to follow in my teacher 's footsteps , my path for now is blocked by the uncertainty of living far from home , by a war that has driven me here , by tuition costs in jordan that are __prohibitively__ expensive . being away from home presents many challenges . you feel like a stranger in a foreign place . you 're not among people who know you , or who want to know you . as a syrian refugee , it is nearly impossible to get permission to be officially employed , and i 've no money to complete my studies . overnight , my dreams changed . in one moment i was at home with family and friends dreaming of studying english , of becoming a schoolteacher . in the next , it all feels lost . it 's impossible to work , impossible to study . we hope to meet our needs today , not so much to fulfill our dreams tomorrow . in syria , i was responsible to my parents , now i am responsible for them . i dreamed of being a teacher , but because my parents are old , i must try each week just to protect them , to cover their basic needs of shelter , food and medicine . i needed some way to support my family . while most syrians are not permitted to work , we can volunteer . i found a role with the __poverty-fighting__ organization care in the urban refugee center in east amman , jordan , where i earn a stipend doing meaningful volunteer work . i have enjoyed it so much . after working there , i have become more social , and no longer feel isolated . it 's not like sitting at home , feeling powerless , losing confidence , wondering what i can do to help my family , to help my people . instead , i feel empowered . i recognize my potential . and , because of that , i refuse to give up on my dreams . my hope is to resettle for the short term in another country so i can continue my studies . i want to complete my education -- and reclaim my dream of teaching syrian children . __resettling__ could help shape my future so that i can help shape theirs . one day , i will tell them of the crisis we faced in the syria that i left . we must be aware of this history , and learn from it . we must empower children to speak up and then be sure that their voices are heard . change starts with them . and it starts with us . each person has the right to pursue an education , to meet their most basic needs , to express themselves . when those rights are stifled , so , too , is a person 's potential , her opportunities , her power to create a better world , and in my case , a better syria . my question to the u.s. people and the international community is this : imagine your life has been turned upside down after you lose everything in a matter of hours : what do you believe in then ? what do you cling to ? the answer , i think , is : your dreams . we all have them . mine , for the time being , have been deferred .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- a 17-year-old male fatally shot an iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new american hometown , targeting him and then continuing to fire as the immigrant rushed to get inside , dallas police said friday . authorities do n't believe the suspected shooter knew the victim , ahmed __al-jumaili__ , dallas police maj. jeff __cotner__ said reporters , nor do they believe he knew __al-jumaili__ 's ethnicity . and they have n't given any indication __al-jumaili__ had anything to do with what led the teen to head out armed in the first place -- a purported shooting at his girlfriend 's apartment , if that in fact happened . __cotner__ said that , while there have nearby shootings that might be tied to gangs , `` we -lrb- have been -rrb- unable to substantiate ... whether or not there was an actual shooting at the apartment . '' what police do believe , based on witness testimony and other evidence , is that the teenager shot and killed __al-jumaili__ , for whatever reason . `` when he saw mr. __al-jumaili__ and their family , he targeted them , he shot at them with intent , '' __cotner__ said of the suspect , who is under arrest . `` and as mr. __al-jumaili__ ran back toward his apartment , he tracked him with his rifle and continued to fire . '' dallas police named the suspected shooter , though cnn is not identifying him yet since he 's a minor and it 's not clear if he 'll be charged as an adult . the teen turns 18 in may , police said . until the fatal shots ended __al-jumalli__ 's life , march 4 had been a day of fun and joy for __al-jumaili__ and his family . the 36-year-old , who had immigrated to the united states 20 days earlier , joined his brother and wife taking pictures in the parking lot of a dallas apartment complex amid the snow . `` just like all of us , a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us , '' __cotner__ said . then came the gunshots and __al-jumaili__ 's cry , `` i 'm hit ! '' a few hours later , the iraqi immigrant was dead . three days later , a dallas detective found surveillance footage from a nearby elementary school showing four people coming from the apartment complex . the black-and-white __soundless__ surveillance video shows one person apparently carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person seemingly carrying a hand gun , dallas police officer monica cordova said . approximately 13 seconds later , another person comes into view and passes by the camera , followed by a fourth individual who is walking , she said . then , on tuesday , a witness walked into the richardson , texas , police station and provided a nickname of a possible suspect -- __kaca__ . that nickname eventually led to the 17-year-old police believe shot __al-jumaili__ . investigators interviewed him for the first time thursday , at which time he denied ever leaving his girlfriend 's apartment . then , authorities got the ok to search his apartment and found an __unfired__ rifle cartridge , __cotner__ said . the teen was brought to dallas police headquarters for another interview , and he changed his story . yes , he had been at the scene of __al-jumaili__ 's killing . but no , he had n't done it . yet that 's not what someone who 'd been with him said . according to __cotner__ , this witness said he saw __al-jumaili__ taking pictures in the snow , . `` the witness stated that he observed -lrb- the suspect -rrb- raise the rifle , '' the police major said . '' ... the witness then heard one shot , followed by several more . '' then all of them bolted . the incident caused waves in dallas ' muslim community . while police have n't given any indication this was a hate crime , though alia salem -- executive director of the council on american-islamic relations in the dallas and fort worth area -- noted `` a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against muslims . '' speaking friday on behalf of __al-jumaili__ 's family , salem expressed gratitude to police and others for their work on the case and said `` our community has been at a loss for words and very saddened by this tragic death . '' `` we just want to see justice happen here , '' she said . `` and this is the first step in that . '' cnn 's pat st. claire and vivian kuo contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- as a __well-traveled__ photographer , pieter ten __hoopen__ is no stranger to refugee camps . but he never experienced any like the mayo camp , which is outside the sudanese capital of khartoum . ten __hoopen__ was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for emergency , a humanitarian group from italy . he also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there . his hopes were dashed , however , when he was told he could n't photograph outside the hospital compound . `` i had very , very hard restrictions from the sudanese government . ... they are very __well-skilled__ in keeping the media at bay , '' ten __hoopen__ said . with no freedom of movement , much like the refugees themselves , ten __hoopen__ resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in africa . with the help of refugee hospital workers , he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available . the studio quickly became a sensation . once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken , lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken . one by one , these people sat solemnly to be photographed . it was their time to be acknowledged . there was gravity , __earnestness__ to the way they posed . this was the moment their story would be registered . `` this was one of the reasons why i built the studio : to get more material and more narratives from the people , '' ten __hoopen__ said . the project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees . the photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp , some have been there for decades . women wearing the traditional sudanese __tobe__ spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped . from the muslim north , women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the christian south , who we also see represented in these photos . whether from sudan , south sudan or eritrea , the faces become , individually and collectively , a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the horn of africa . social media . follow __@cnnphotos__ on twitter to join the conversation about photography . the word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict , their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs . ten __hoopen__ wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely . `` they got very serious , they sat down upright . ... i tried to say as little as possible , '' he said . `` i do believe in their own expressions , their own narrative ... and their unique perspective . '' the studio had a comforting effect . it was a haven from the __hustling__ and bustling of the camp hospital . it gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye , giving each person their deserved attention . aesthetically , it created an aura around each person , beaming light on his or her personal narrative . it had some uplifting effects as well . `` i always try to put some extra thought to -lrb- projects -rrb- . so i build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the african continent or in europe ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way , '' ten __hoopen__ said . he said some patients at the hospital `` had being laying there for months in their room . ... then you take them out , it 's a little treat to get them out of their own misery . ... that 's why you see the line growing , because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio . '' ten-month-old __buseiwa__ was not laughing when she entered the studio . having just had a blood test for malaria , she clearly looked uneasy . gazing to someone who is holding her hand , her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength . __hawa__ __haranan__ , 40 , came from the war-torn darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital . as she wears a simple __tobe__ , one can almost see the emotions behind her __leonine__ stare . her life and struggle , as with the other individuals photographed , is accounted for with the testimony of a camera . ten __hoopen__ used __tilt-shift__ lenses , which are normally used with the __large-format__ cameras used in classic photography . `` i really can appreciate old __portraiture__ ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded , i think , with respect and it was a very serious moment , '' he said . `` it 's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you . '' how did ten __hoopen__ gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees , some severely traumatized and living in fear ? `` it was n't hard , '' he said . `` i just told them to relax and have fun . `` kids sometimes got nervous , and i do n't blame them . i am a tall , white , bald european guy . ... i am not only funny to look at , but it is hot in that country so i am usually very red when i am photographing . ... i have tattoos everywhere . ... they thought i was a quite interesting creature .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- deep within the amazonian rainforest of ecuador live the __huaorani__ . photographer __trupal__ __pandya__ traveled about 30 hours by air , water and land to reach this native community and take their portraits . the __huaorani__ , which means `` the people '' or `` human beings , '' are believed to have inhabited the rainforest for thousands of years . until about the 1960s , they never had any contact with the outside world . __pandya__ said there is a contrast between the modernization of the younger generation , who travel to areas outside of their community , and the older generation , who make efforts to maintain their traditional ways of living . diverse changes have taken place within the community : the introduction of radios within many __huaorani__ homes , the consumption of food from cities and the adoption of __westernized__ clothing . for __pandya__ , these changes were a significant factor in his decision to photograph the __huaorani__ . `` the biggest -lrb- reason -rrb- was to just go out there and photograph the change before everything changes , '' __pandya__ said . `` i think if i would have -lrb- photographed the __huaorani__ -rrb- 10 years back down the line or a little later than that , i do n't think i would have got what i just got . '' another aspect of modernization has to do with language . many __huaorani__ , who for years have only communicated using a regional dialect , now speak the ecuadorian native language of spanish . __pandya__ speaks english , so he needed translators to interact effectively . but it is apparent from his experiences with the __huaorani__ that actions can certainly not only speak louder than words , but be more __effectual__ than words when attempting to convey one 's intentions . `` i never started photographing when i -lrb- first -rrb- saw -lrb- the __huaorani__ -rrb- , '' he said . `` i did n't even have my camera . i waited to let them get used to me around them . i gave myself time to get a little easier around them . even if you can not talk in the same language , i feel that you definitely connect to them as a human being . '' social media . follow __@cnnphotos__ on twitter to join the conversation about photography . prior to creating formal portraits using his professional camera equipment and lighting , __pandya__ took polaroid photos of the __huaorani__ that they were then able to keep . `` i think some of them saw the polaroid for the first time , so they were really happy to see themselves like that , '' __pandya__ said . for his formal portraits , __pandya__ placed his subjects in front of a solid white background in order to portray the __huaorani__ in a very direct and concise manner , eliminating the presence of any distractions . `` the main reason was to have the focus only on the people and their clothes and nothing else but them as an individual , them as a human being , '' he said . __pandya__ 's decision to use a white background also proved effective in highlighting the coexistence between the __huaorani__ and the different kinds of animals they encounter daily in their natural environment . creating portraits of the __huaorani__ has been a `` fascinating , challenging '' experience for __pandya__ , who is studying photography in new york at the fashion institute of technology . after witnessing firsthand the simplicity in which the __huaorani__ live in harmony with their environment , __pandya__ said he finds himself thinking about and reflecting upon what it truly means to be satisfied and content with life . `` i think the question i ask myself is : ` who 's richer ? ' '' he said . '' -lrb- this has been -rrb- a really big learning curve of how to just live a very beautiful , normal life .

ARTICEL:     hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- the search is on for china 's teen top guns . china said monday it has selected 16 high schools to offer pilot training as the country 's armed forces seek to attract better qualified recruits . the schools , in 11 provinces across the country , will recruit 1,000 male junior high school students aged between 14 to 16 , the china daily reported . successful applicants will receive flight training and `` military standard '' physical training in addition to their regular high-school studies . it 's the latest attempt by the people 's liberation army 's air force to attract more talent . last year , it said it would require wannabe pilots to take psychological assessments and a flight simulation test . china 's military has traditionally been focused on winning land battles and is now making efforts to improve its air and naval power in the pursuit of what president xi jinping has called `` balanced strength . '' `` china has made many strides in the development of advanced aircraft , but it must make sure there can be sufficient , well-trained pilots to fly them , '' wang ya ` nan , deputy editor-in-chief of aerospace knowledge magazine told the china daily last month . the recruits will receive a stipend and board at the schools . traditionally , serving in the military has not been a sought-after career in china and a u.s. report on china 's military transformation released last month singled out the quality and professionalism of new recruits as a major challenge . many are still drawn from rural areas with limited education , while country 's one-child policy , which has created the `` little emperor '' phenomenon of spoiled children , produces recruits who `` may not be tough enough to withstand military discipline , '' the report added . to this end , china has been making efforts to recruit more high school and college graduates as it __modernizes__ its armed forces . on completing the three-year program , students will take a pilot selection test , and those who pass will join a pla flight academy and those who fail can choose to enter other military universities or civilian institutes .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- it should n't come as a surprise that yemen has collapsed -- again . a country that has split and been pulled together before , has the youngest and fastest growing population in the region , is running low on oil and water , and possesses a `` __personalist__ '' government rather than stable institutions , was on the top of every expert 's list as the fragile state most likely to fail next . what is surprising is that u.s. policy ignored all of this and proceeded on the premise that simply __drone-bombing__ al qaeda terrorists could keep yemen intact and stable . indeed , last fall , when president barack obama pointed to u.s. policy in yemen as an example of a `` success '' and a model for the plans that would roll back the islamic state -lrb- also known as isis -rrb- , i __shivered__ . for as september ended , shi'ite houthi rebels from the north moved south and took the capital city , sanaa . by january , the islamic state was noticeably increasing its recruitment in yemen , and that same month the __yemen-based__ al qaeda in the arabian peninsula claimed responsibility for organizing the deadly charlie hebdo attacks in paris . last week , the islamic state bombed two shi'ite mosques in yemen , killing more than 130 worshippers at prayer . this week , the houthi forces are closing in on yemen 's second major city , aden , on the south coast , and the __u.s.-supported__ president , abdu __rabbu__ mansour hadi , has reportedly fled the country . as the united states has closed its embassy and withdrawn its last troops , yemen has slid into total chaos , with rebels and jihadists on both sides capturing military bases and seizing tanks and heavy weapons . the situation is so dire that a coalition of sunni nations , led by saudi arabia , has launched massive airstrikes against the houthis , with a saudi adviser threatening to bring up to 150,000 ground troops into yemen to restore the hadi regime . yemen does have value as a lesson -- this is what happens when you ignore the basic foundations of social stability . these include legitimate leadership with stable succession plans ; a united elite ; institutions to bridge regional and ethnic divisions and assure fairness in political and economic access and a functioning economy with capabilities for providing employment and growth . rather than working to secure these things , the u.s. administration has succumbed to the illusion that precision bombing or other surgical interventions to remove `` dangerous elements '' will sustain broader social and political stability . anyone could see that the conditions for collapse were progressing in yemen and that aerial attacks on al qaeda terrorists would have no effect on them . those attacks were a sideshow -- like firing a lousy band performing on the deck of an ocean liner , while a hull full of holes is taking on water fast . what we have now is an area with about 24 million people , more than twice the population now under the rule of the islamic state in eastern syria and western iraq , that is virtually __ungoverned__ and up for grabs and is falling into the grips of an all-out civil war between __iran-supported__ __shi'as__ and al __qaeda/isis-aligned__ sunnis . it is a war that the west loses no matter who wins . it is now too late to do much of anything except watch and try to either support any moderate elements if they should emerge as capable of holding regional or national power , or contain any dangerous jihadist elements if they should do so . either task will be difficult , and provide yet another costly distraction to efforts to restore peace in syria and iraq . in other words , what has happened in yemen , although predictable , is about the worst outcome imaginable for u.s. policy . that america ever deluded itself into thinking airstrikes were enough to deal with the problems of failing states in the middle east and north africa -- and the crisis of isis -- is a notion that could only be made more frightening if it keeps on doing it .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- hillary clinton worked hard last week to put the `` dead end '' sign on the state department email story by announcing there was nothing to find . but in her rush to control the narrative , clinton may have -lrb- once again -rrb- missed the bigger picture : in politics as much as in business , authenticity matters . her press conference had the familiar ring of a controlled performance -- the carefully __parsed__ explanation , the combative posture -- that stretched our belief that what she 's telling us is really the whole story . people wonder : is she playing it straight with us ? why the nagging suspicion that brand hillary does not include bringing to the public table who she really is ? as the author joe mcginniss reported in his classic book on the 1968 nixon campaign , `` the selling of a president , '' political consultants long ago began marketing candidates like bars of soap . the practice has accelerated since the '60s as campaigns have concluded that political brands face the same tests among voters that consumer brands do among customers . and among consumers today , authenticity means more to success than at any other time in the history of brands . the desire for authenticity is a tangible driver of revenue for brands . increasingly , people want to give their money to brands -- political as well as commercial -- that have a set of values they can also buy into . as author james h. gilmore told the new york times , a sense of authenticity reinforces trust in what is real `` in an increasingly staged , contrived and mediated world . '' a recent global study found that 63 % of consumers would buy a brand they perceive as authentic over its competitors , and more than 60 % would recommend an organization they perceive to be authentic . ignoring the importance of authenticity to voters is a significant risk , as both mitt romney and al gore learned too late . and they were running in a __perceptual__ environment more forgiving than today 's . voters easily identified the space between who these candidates really were and how they wanted us to perceive them . romney , the successful entrepreneur and moderate politician , struggled to seem ordinary and `` severely conservative , '' while gore was perceived as having such an overblown sense of himself that the claim of having invented the internet stuck to him like mud , even though he 'd never said it . the two shared what will likely also be clinton 's destiny : winning a party nomination by default as there were few compelling alternatives . for clinton , an __uncontested__ rise to the democratic nomination could mislead her campaign into believing that she does n't have a problem with authenticity . she does , especially among independents and republicans . to be fair , clinton 's appeal as potentially the first woman to reach the white house makes her seem virtually bulletproof among certain voting groups . a recent gallup poll shows `` first female '' status as the `` best thing about a hillary clinton presidency , '' leading the positives mentioned by 30 % of democrats and 17 % of independents . but the __next-closest__ best thing about clinton is a long way off : her experience is mentioned by only 16 % of democrats and 8 % of independents . a fledgling campaign apparatus , with powerful political recruits like john podesta and robby __mook__ and marquee brand wizards from coca-cola and microsoft , might want to be looking hard at the dangerously lukewarm voter sentiment about experience and suitability that is lingering just beneath the surface of the `` first female president '' juggernaut . part of the heightened danger coming out of her press conference lies among millennials , who will be a critical voting group for democrats in the 2016 presidential election . and authenticity is of paramount importance to millennials in how they relate to everything in their lives , including politicians . as one commenter on a __mediapost__ article on millennials put it , `` if brands ca n't be authentic millennials will call them on it . want to win our hearts ? a little __self-deprecation__ and humility never hurt . '' forty percent of millennials in the u.s. admit to full-blown cynicism about the way they are approached by brands of all kinds . according to the __mediapost__ article , authenticity and the allied trait of __trustworthiness__ are two of the top brand attributes millennials look for before they make a decision to hand over their money and , one could argue by extension , their vote . these days , too , it 's trickier than ever for brands to stay in step with the conversations that move people to make judgments . whether they 're consumers or voters , people are more in tune with each other than at any other time in human history . they can gang up more easily to support or reject a person , an idea , and , yes , a company , brand or politician . brands are left on the outside looking in , puzzling out how to insert themselves into a meaningful relationship with constituents who can turn on them at any second . this trend of demanding more authenticity from brands they invest in , and rewarding brands for it , has been accelerating with consumers across the u.s. over the course of the very same seven years since clinton last ran for president . since consumers are also voters , it stands to reason that any political brand -- including hillary clinton -- should look even more seriously today at how to increase its value by focusing on perceptions of its authenticity .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's called the grand renaissance dam -- and the clue is in the name . with some 8,500 laborers working around the clock on its construction , the __imposingly-named__ dam is surely one of africa 's most ambitious infrastructure projects , __reaffirming__ ethiopia 's ambitions of becoming a big regional player and a major exporter of power . when completed , the project will generate around 6,000 megawatts of electricity for both domestic use and exports . the most striking aspect of the nearly $ 5 billion enterprise is , however , that it is entirely funded by ethiopia , without any foreign investment . according to the authorities , 20 % of the project is financed from bond offerings to ethiopians , and the remaining 80 % from tax collection . `` it was seen as a strategically important initiative that the government and the ethiopian people are financing it 100 % , '' says __zemedeneh__ __negatu__ , managing partner at ernst & young ethiopia . `` they have come up with a very creative and innovative way that i think will be a lesson for other african countries who want to embark on such large infrastructure projects , and want to have the flexibility to do it themselves , '' he adds . hydroelectric powerhouse . so far , ethiopians at home and abroad have contributed about $ 350 million , and the government says that the 170 meter tall dam is on track for a 2017 opening , with 40 % of the work already complete . ethiopia 's per capita income might be one of the lowest in the world , but the country has enjoyed an impressive economic growth since 2000 , averaging 10.9 % annually , which has resulted in a 33 % reduction of people living in poverty . if the grand renaissance dam and other hydroelectric projects , such as the __gibe__ iii dam on the __omo__ river , are completed on time , the world bank estimates ethiopia could earn $ 1 billion a year from electricity exports . __negatu__ says that this would make the country the largest exporter of power in africa , and second only to south africa when it comes to installed capacity . unhappy neighbors . yet , not everyone is happy about ethiopia 's energetic drive to harness its water resources . the grand renaissance dam is being built on blue nile , a __tributary__ of the nile river which has been powering the agriculture of sudan and egypt -- through which it flows -- for millennia . these countries have opposed the project in the past , fearing that the dam will reduce their share of the nile water . the ousted egyptian president mohamed morsi had even threatened to defend `` each drop of nile water with our blood if necessary '' back in 2013 . passions have been calmer more recently , and today the reuters news agency reported that representatives of egypt , sudan and ethiopia reached a preliminary agreement in khartoum on how to operate the dam . __negatu__ is convinced that a compromise will be reached , as he thinks that the dam will ultimately benefit not just ethiopia but most other east african nations . `` this is actually a regional project because up from egypt all the way down to rwanda , countries are going to buy the power that 's generated by this dam , '' __negatu__ says , adding that both rwanda and kenya have already agreed to purchase thousands of megawatts once the project is finished . a lack of reliable power has long stunted africa 's development , with 600 million people on the continent not connected to the grid and getting by on a mix of generators , kerosene lamps and candles . in ethiopia , only 15 to 20 % of the population has access to power according to a study by chatham house . `` it 's africa 's achilles ' heel , '' says __negatu__ . `` with anyone who wants to build a factory in africa , the first thing they ask is infrastructure , and within infrastructure , whether there is sufficient electricity . __industrialization__ has always been about electricity , and this -lsb- dam -rsb- addresses this basic need . '' he adds that , after depending on exporting raw commodities for decades , governments across africa should be pursuing a strategy of __industrialization__ , following the example of china . `` we 've got to move up the value chain , and it 's what ethiopia is doing right now . its strategy is __industrial-based__ -- not to export commodities but to manufacture __value-added__ things , and other african nations are trying to emulate that . but without electricity there wo n't be __industrialization__ in africa .

'' asked hernandez lawyer charles rankin about her previous testimony to the grand jury . `` never , '' said jenkins . `` were you ever asked if it had any smell to it ? '' he asked . `` never , '' she replied . jenkins ' revelation contradicts the prosecution 's previous suspicion that the weapon used in the slaying was in the box . no weapon in the case has been recovered . home surveillance video played inside the courtroom monday showed shayanna jenkins hoisting a black garbage bag from her home and putting it in a trunk of her sister 's car . at the time , shaneah jenkins had been at her home grieving over the death of her boyfriend . shaneah jenkins was present in court on monday and cried while listening to the testimony and watching the video of her sister shayanna carrying the trash bag . the two sisters now barely speak to each other . shaneah jenkins sits next to lloyd 's mother in the courtroom on the opposite side of hernandez 's defense team . after concealing the box with her daughter 's clothing , shayanna jenkins said she disposed of it at a location she can not remember . `` i found a random dumpster , and put it in there , '' she told bristol county district attorney william mccauley . when questioned about her inability to remember the dumpster 's location and other details , shayanna jenkins said she had been unsettled at the time . `` i was nervous . i had to comfort my sister . everyone 's emotions were on me , and it was a form of breaking down at that point , '' she said . on monday , shayanna jenkins was asked about what she called an `` on-again , off-again '' relationship with hernandez , her high school sweetheart . she recalled spending time apart from hernandez after discovering evidence of infidelity on hernandez 's phone . she told the court that before getting back together with him , she had to make a difficult choice about her future with the football star . `` i made a decision that if i was going to move back in with aaron , i would need to compromise with his behavior , including his infidelity , '' she told the courtroom and then started to cry . after hernandez proposed in october 2012 , jenkins said she continued to tolerate his infidelity . jenkins admitted giving some different answers during her grand jury testimony , in part , she said because of confusing questions by prosecutors . she faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges . jenkins has pleaded not guilty . this week , the jury is expected to hear from alexander bradley , hernandez 's former right hand man , who has accused hernandez of shooting him in the face in february of 2013 . however , a judge has barred him from discussing that . bradley is jailed in an unrelated shooting . the trial is scheduled to resume at 9 a.m. tuesday . susan candiotti and lawrence crook reported from fall river , massachusetts . cnn 's karen smith wrote from atlanta .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- this is what it 's come to . starbucks asked its local baristas to have conversations about race . not the federal government or congress . not academia or the naacp . but a national coffee shop chain waded into an area of social conflict that is as old as the slave ships and as modern as stop-and-frisk policing . then people went crazy . starbucks ceo howard schultz was accused of ruining that magic morning moment when customers fork over $ 4.15 for a `` grande '' coffee with warm skim milk and vanilla extract . a barista writing `` race together '' on cups was called an affront to mornings and coffee -- such important conversations belonged inside a hallowed institution , not a common coffee shop , where apparently people no longer chat . a lot of the reaction came via snipes on twitter from people calling schultz out on starbucks ' diversity , the hue of his __mochaccinos__ , or his liberal `` brewing '' of controversy . the __nastiness__ drove the company 's communications chief briefly off twitter . then , after barely a week , starbucks shut down the whole __darned__ thing , pushing ahead with a hiring and media initiative instead . but treating twitter as an important voice of american conscience is like focusing on the annoying beep emitting from your smoke detector instead of addressing the fact that the battery 's run dry . what 's trending is not necessarily what matters . people do need to talk about race . not because of a harmless coffee cup , but because we have a real race problem and we need solutions . starfish media group just finished a nationwide tour of american colleges , universities and communities called `` black in america 2015 . '' it 's based on our cnn documentary series that takes a close look at the challenges and triumphs of being black in america : from the hopes of the martin luther king era to today 's unlikely brew of __un-kept__ promises and vast opportunities . there were plenty of conversations about race among the thousands of black and white college students and panelists like rapper chuck d and cedric alexander of the national organization of black law enforcement executives . they lined up to talk about how their experiences mirrored those of the people in the documentaries : black families finding common roots with whites , the politics of skin color , or the __black-and-blue__ conflict over the police engaging in racial profiling . the topics and perceptions were an unending thread . not only did people talk when they were offered the chance ; they wanted to talk . at stony brook university , one of our tour stops , a young white male student asked our panel if __effecting__ change in racial discrimination today was even harder to achieve than it was during the civil rights era when racism was more overt . what a good question . there are no longer signs __segregating__ our bathrooms and water fountains , but police are being caught on cell phone videos in apparent attacks on young black men -- the new __signposts__ of racial inequality . new technology has multiplied and spread symbols of racial injustice , but that has created new challenges and new reasons to talk . in this country we sometimes pretend we are so far past the ugly days of jim crow and __middle-of-the-night__ cross __burnings__ as to have no racial issues to discuss . we did , after all , elect a black president who , like me , has both a black and a white parent and descends from immigrants . but blacks and whites do n't see things the same , and that is a big problem we need to discuss . pew research center asked people of both races this year how much more needs to be done to achieve racial equality . __seventy-nine__ percent of blacks said `` a lot '' more work needs to be done . just 44 % of whites thought the same . our country is more diverse than ever -- 13 % african-american and 17 % latino , according to the u.s. census -- but we still live in different worlds . blacks have more debt , higher unemployment , less financial security , are less likely to be married or own homes , and are less likely to be represented in corporate boardrooms , the tech industry or even congress . perhaps more alarmingly , 75 % of black students are going to schools where the majority of the students look just like them . it has been 60 years since brown v. board of education was supposed to bring our schoolchildren together on an equal playing field . that is something worth talking about . recently , bryan stevenson , who founded the equal justice initiative in montgomery , alabama , examined the details behind __3,959__ __lynchings__ in 12 southern states from 1877 to 1950 . he wants to raise money to __memorialize__ the sites . we may not live in that land any more , though the fbi is investigating the death of a black man found hanging among the walnut trees this month in mississippi . but we do live in a land where there is a modern terror digging roots in the minds of young black men . in 2014 , our cnn documentary `` black in america : black & blue '' showed police officers talking __fearfully__ about facing off against young criminals on familiar streets and african-american men in fear that they would become the victims of police shootings . the documentary was released just as grand juries chose not to indict the police officers in the eric garner and ferguson , missouri , cases . to me , it reveals how damaging the rift in our perceptions can be . a young man named __keeshan__ harley talked about being frisked over 100 times . why ? `` because i fit the description , '' said the black college student . seventy percent of blacks believe , just like __keeshan__ , that the police treat racial and ethnic groups differently and do not hold police officers accountable for misconduct , according to a study by the pew research center . the percentage of whites who agree with that perception hovers in the mid-30s . much of the white community does n't perceive or understand the persecution of a __keeshan__ harley . but when they see a videotape , as in the eric garner case , many finally recognize there is a problem . we need to consider how a lack of confidence in government and law enforcement is dangerous in a civil society . a young man named luis __paulino__ shared a cell phone video with me when i was reporting `` black & blue . '' it shows tall white police officers beating luis on the street for no apparent reason . he could n't call the police for help . these were the police . what if there had been no tape , i asked him . `` nobody would have believed me , '' he said . `` it would have been my word against 15 police officers . '' that is modern-day terror , and worth at least a coffee shop chat . black people talk about race all the time , from processing comments about our freckles to recounting how someone rolls their fingers through our child 's curly hair . we do n't get or expect an even playing field at work . we do n't ever get to cross a street in a hoodie at night without the other pedestrians making a string of assumptions . we do n't have some __mutable__ characteristic . we wake up and go to bed black , and that makes a difference in this country . ceo howard schultz was left wondering why it was such a bad idea to encourage people to talk about race . his initial letter to his staff made it clear he believes his __#racetogether__ coffee cup campaign can contribute to starting an important conversation . `` what if our customers ... had a renewed level of understanding and sensitivity about the issue , and they themselves would spread that to their own sphere of influence ? '' what a good question it was . what if ?

'' day tours take in popular sights like the opera house and central post office designed by gustav eiffel , but also stop at local eateries and offbeat locations . one popular early morning pit stop is tao dan park where ho chi minh city 's bird __fanciers__ puff themselves up like their caged pets in a display of tweeting __one-upmanship__ . __unfortunately/thankfully__ , you 're not the one driving . all the mopeds are driven by local , experienced drivers who have no problem with the swarm of vehicles on the roads . a local tour guide rides along , too , to add context to the sights , smells and sounds experienced from the back of a __two-stroke__ motor . mueller took a __circuitous__ route to setting up the company . after traveling around southeast asia in 1997 he settled in vietnam the following year and discovered a glut of classic italian scooters that needed a bit of tlc . he bought his first one after just three days in the country and spying an opportunity to tap into international __vespa__ enthusiasts ' desire for authentic rides , set up a restoration and export business . it became so successful he was in danger of putting himself out of a job , so in 2006 he decided to start a tour company offering __multi-day__ tours outside of ho chi minh city . according to mueller , his business was kick-started by vietnam 's appearance on the tv program `` top gear , '' which showed the country 's beautiful countryside and __underused__ roads . longer trips are still offered by __vespa__ tours , taking willing riders as far as the vietnam highlands and the coastal city of __nha__ __trang__ over seven days . most of the scooters in mueller 's garage __hark__ back to the golden age of __vespas__ , the late '60s and 1970s , refurbished with replacement parts from __piaggio-licensed__ __machinists__ in india . true to their reputation , the 100 or so classic scooters owned by __vespa__ adventures break down frequently -- mechanics are on hand for running repairs -- but mueller believes its all part of the charm in a city where two wheels beats two legs . vietnam __vespa__ adventures , __169a__ de __tham__ , district 1 , ho chi minh city , vietnam ; __+84 12 2299 3585__ / __+84__ 9 __3850__ __0997__ .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- americans like to complain about the endless political gridlock in our capital . but if we 're honest we need to look in the mirror too . many of us abandoned the field by not voting in last year 's midterm elections . those of us who did vote elected more fire __breathers__ than bridge builders to congress . what 's more , when we 're invited to tell our representatives what we want , we can be as __demagogic__ as they are . remember the town hall meetings in the summer of 2009 , which erupted in shouting matches between citizens and legislators over health care ? who can forget the massachusetts woman holding a picture of president obama defaced to look like hitler , who demanded to know why former rep. barney frank supported the `` nazi policy '' of extending health care to all ? his frank response : `` ma'am , trying to have a conversation with you would be like trying to argue with a dining room table . i have no interest in doing it . '' rather than blame our leaders for the dysfunction , we need to change the game . we can turn to public forums to tackle big issues of the day . consider two efforts to move beyond the contentious debate about climate change . in washington , the senate made a splash by voting for the first time to acknowledge that global warming is really happening . unfortunately , senators could n't agree on whether humans are changing the climate and what to do about it . stalemate . outside of the beltway , in southeast florida , it 's been five years since the region adopted a comprehensive climate action plan with 110 steps aimed at mitigating its dangers and reducing the region 's carbon emissions . as research by dan __kahan__ of yale law school shows , these counties took action not because floridians are less divided over political issues , or less partisan , or more scientifically literate than the rest of america . no one sang __kumbaya__ or hugged a polar bear . instead , florida officials engaged their constituents through scores of open forums convened by governments , businesses and community groups . local leaders appealed across party lines by framing the issue as one of protecting residents from rising sea levels and storm surges , rather than as a divisive referendum on whether to believe in climate science . rather than seeing citizens as targets of a political campaign , officials governed with the diverse residents of their community to develop practical solutions that garnered broad support . `` we recognize each other 's differences , '' explained susanne __torriente__ , fort lauderdale 's assistant city manager , `` but also recognize that if we work together we can make south florida more resilient . '' given what florida accomplished , gov. rick scott 's ban on using the terms `` climate change '' in state policy discussions to avoid polarization looks smart , not __smarmy__ . florida is not alone . our research identifies many successful examples of political deliberation in __well-designed__ forums where citizens and officials engage in __give-and-take__ discussion and arrive at solutions . these forums have developed `` __participatory__ budgets '' in many cities , energy policy in texas and nebraska , community policing in chicago and much more . some of these forums are healing the rotting roots of democracy . for example , __gerrymandering__ of political districts has become one way to protect the party in power and create safe seats for incumbents , __sapping__ their incentive to represent constituents from the opposing party or craft bipartisan legislation . as a north carolina state senator once said , `` we are in the business of rigging elections . '' in response in 2010 californians used their power to approve ballot initiatives to create a nonpartisan citizens redistricting commission , which __redrew__ political districts that better reflected the state 's communities and helped elect a legislature that could work together more __productively__ . this is one reason why the state 's budgeting process , once an endless game of chicken that paralyzed public services and rang up huge deficits , has become less __rancorous__ and more fiscally responsible . let 's hope the supreme court does n't kill this reform . but not every ballot initiative is as enlightened . many are highly technical proposals pushed by special interests , and multiple initiatives can overwhelm the public 's ability to evaluate them all . oregon 's legislature responded by creating a citizens initiative review board , which researches proposed ballot measures , __deliberates__ about their pros and cons , and makes recommendations on how fellow citizens should vote . many __oregonians__ rely on the board 's recommendations , which are published in the state 's voter guide and mailed to every household . unlike politics as usual -lrb- and those infamous town hall meetings -rrb- , these forums put citizens at the center of decision-making . citizens are challenged to deliberate with each other and forge agreements , with officials and experts joining the effort by giving testimony and feedback . moderators challenge people to treat other respectfully and consider a wide range of arguments and evidence , rather than engaging in hand-to-hand political combat . grandstanding and __obstructionism__ do n't play as well in these forums as they do on the senate floor , partisan media outlets or the local tavern . it 's still politics , but it 's a politics that offers better odds of success by engaging both citizens and officials __productively__ . the people who participate , many of whom regard typical public meetings like ebola , say they actually enjoy talking politics with other citizens and officials , sometimes for the first time in their lives . can you imagine that ? while there are experts who know how to design good forums , it 's no easy task . as the health care town hall meetings showed , simply throwing open the doors is not sufficient . most people do n't have the time to attend a forum , so they need to know whether people like them deliberated and the rules of engagement were fair . it 's important to ensure that citizens can participate on equal terms . if we want to move beyond political stalemate , we should strengthen these innovative forums for citizens to deliberate with each other and officials . when these forums work , they put citizens and leaders on the same side of the __chessboard__ .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- for four years , william bruce james ii called the university of oklahoma 's sigma alpha epsilon his home . he walked its halls , __bunked__ in its rooms , held office as one of its leaders , considered his fraternity brothers his dearest friends . he was proud to be __sae__ . now that pride is tainted . a video shot this saturday of __party-bound__ shows __sae__ members clapping , pumping their fists and chanting in unison : `` there will never be a ni **** __sae__ , '' they sing . `` you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me . '' these young men are talking about him , james said . that 's because not only is he an __sae__ alumni , he is also african-american . how do you make sense of the fact that those behind these hateful words wore the same pledge pins , occupied the same house , preached `` the same motto that i hold dear to my heart '' as james did ? `` i could n't look at myself , '' he said , `` still claiming to be that . '' since the video surfaced sunday , students have been expelled and __sae__ 's oklahoma chapter has shut down . the episode has left james disgusted , horrified that members of a fraternity that once welcomed him could __espouse__ such hatred . students expelled over racist chant . `` i do n't know what happened to the culture of my home , '' he told cnn on tuesday . `` that is not my home . that is not __sae__ . they are not my brothers . '' while the oklahoma frat has never had a lot of black members , that did n't matter to james when he joined in 2001 . __sae__ was where he forged lifelong friendships , where he and others grew into men . `` we were becoming something while i was there , '' he said . `` something that i do n't think these kids grasped . ... i do n't think they know what it means to be a brother of any fraternity , let alone mine . '' james does n't believe the racist chant was an isolated incident , not given how many on the bus seemingly sang it so easily and enthusiastically . nor does he think that only those leading the chant deserve punishment . just as easily as one person could have started it , someone else could have called for it to stop . that 's what james thinks that his own fraternity brothers would 've done , whether he was around or not . they understood the importance of stepping up to say : `` this is n't right , this is n't what i stand for , this is n't __gentlemanly__ , this is n't even human , '' he said . `` that 's what being an __sae__ is . '' `` my pledge class ... would n't let that happen , '' he said . `` and i do n't know what 's happened to -lrb- the oklahoma __sae__ chapter -rrb- since then . '' many members of that pledge class , as well others who he knew from __sae__ , have reached out to james in recent days by text , phone , email and facebook . he knows he is not alone , including in his support for __disbanding__ oklahoma 's __sae__ chapter . `` that entire house has accepted the culture that accepts that song , those words , that imagery , '' james said . `` so the whole house has to be punished . '' his former frat brothers are different from him , of course . their skin color would n't have stopped them from getting into __sae__ if the twisted chant reflected reality . still , james feels their pain is real and sincere . those on this weekend 's video may not be his brothers , but those he knew from 2001 to 2005 still are . `` i do n't think that they can fully encompass the pain and betrayal that i feel , '' james said of his white friends from the fraternity . `` but by holding me so close in their life , they know that their brother was hurt . '' `` so it 's a thing they 're feeling in their family . i 'm family to them . ''

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- after enduring about four days at sea under stressful conditions , __tyke__ , an african elephant , escaped during a circus performance , crushing her trainer to death and injuring dozens of others while storming through the streets of honolulu . __tyke__ suffered a slow and painful death after being hit by a barrage of bullets fired by police officers . that incident happened 20 years ago , but the welcome announcement last week by __feld__ entertainment -- parent company to ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus -- that it plans to retire elephants from its circuses by 2018 is a reminder of how that controversy lingers . in analyzing the horrific experience involving __tyke__ , it was reported that the elephant had been rebellious before she arrived on our shores , and she is said to have had a history of acting out and being unpredictable . and though she was not submissive and was difficult to train , her owners sent her to honolulu anyway . sadly , performing animals in circuses and traveling shows are too often subjected to inhumane conditions , especially in their training . __reward-based__ training takes time and patience , which are things that many circus trainers do not have . instead , these trainers frequently resort to other inhumane means , involving beating the animals , using electrical __prods__ , depriving them of food , chaining them and other brutal methods to force the animals into submission . following this sort of brutal training , the animals may appear tame , but they are still wild and their original wild instincts will appear if provoked . meanwhile , animals that are no longer useful to the circus or traveling shows due to age or temperament may be given away or sold to other less reputable organizations . they lack proper veterinary care , and what little quality of life they did have is diminished further . the welfare of the animal is not taken into account . rather than being treated as a commodity by the owner , animals should be protected and well cared for . ringling bros. and barnum & bailey has said it prides itself on providing a healthy environment for animals . yet whatever provisions they may make , the reality is that circuses are particularly __unsuited__ to meet the unique needs of elephants . these extremely intelligent animals live in large family groups when in the wild , and they form close social ties with other elephants . but the circus environment keeps them isolated and provides little to no interaction with their own species . their __herd-like__ behavior is ignored when they are being trained to perform . these very social animals , simply put , should not be living in solitary confinement . animal welfare advocates have often been criticized as being against `` fun . '' we are told that circuses and traveling shows are about education . but what could one possibly learn about animals from watching these shows ? observing wild animals perform unnatural tricks while dancing in __tutus__ only teaches the public that the sole purpose of animals is our entertainment . are these really the values we want our children to learn ? wildlife sanctuaries and accredited zoos should exist for conservation , preservation and __propagation__ of species and for public education . this is where learning should occur . wild animals should be permitted to exist undisturbed in their natural environments , and when they must be confined , it should be in a natural setting consistent with their physical and behavioral needs . this is the proper setting for education and study . ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus has come a long way in its thinking , and for that we congratulate the company for its decision to move the elephants to its sanctuary in florida . rather than fighting the many cities and counties that have taken steps to pass __anti-circus__ and __anti-elephant__ ordinances , the company instead is putting its resources toward the study and protection of elephants . with this step , we look forward to the day that it , and other circuses , phase out all wild animals , including the lions and tigers that also are featured in their shows . after all , wild and exotic animals are not meant to entertain us . the hawaiian humane society feels strongly about the humane treatment of all animals , whether domesticated or wild . our organization , like others in the animal welfare movement , seeks to prevent any practice that might produce pain , stress , injury or suffering to any animal . this is an important part of creating a more humane society -- for people and all animals .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- while boston and other new england cities have suffered through their __snowiest__ seasons , other parts of the country have some unexpected good news to go along with the record-breaking winter conditions . all that cold air and a stuck weather pattern are keeping tornadoes to historic lows so far this year . march is typically a transitional month , where warm moist air from the gulf of mexico collides with cold arctic air to produce severe thunderstorms and tornadoes . this year , however , the jet stream pattern responsible for all the cold air and snow in the east remains stuck in more of a winter mode . `` we 're in a persistent pattern that suppresses severe weather , and the right ingredients -- moisture , instability and lift -- -lrb- have yet to come together -rrb- , '' said greg __carbin__ , the warning coordination meteorologist with the storm prediction center in norman , oklahoma . the group is responsible for issuing the tornado and severe thunderstorm watches that warn the public of impending severe weather . so far this year it 's been extremely quiet . by this time in mid-march the center would have issued 52 tornado watches nationwide . this year they have issued a paltry four . both january and february were well below normal . march has been even quieter . at a time where the tornado season usually ramps up considerably , there has not been a single report this month of a tornado . `` we are in uncharted territory with respect to the lack of severe weather '' __carbin__ said . in fact if we make it through the entire month of march without any tornado reports it would be a first , according to the center . there have been around 20 tornadoes reported since january 1 , well below the 10-year average of 130 for the period from the beginning of the year until mid-march . this year comes on the heels of what was has been a welcome lull of tornadoes across the united states the past several years . in 2014 , we ended the year with a count of __881__ , well below the average of __1,253__ . meteorologists do n't fully understand why we have seen the recent drop in tornadoes , but one possible answer is the development of el nino , a warming in the equatorial pacific , which can influence weather patterns globally . recent studies point to lower tornado counts in the united states during these events . the national oceanic and atmospheric administration recently said that a weak el nino had developed . so while all agree this is good news so far this year , it is clear that it is no guarantee that the rest of the season will remain this quiet . weather patterns can change quickly . in 1984 , for instance , there was a very similar slow start through mid-march and the number of tornadoes ended up well above average by the end of june , according to data from the storm center . it 's also important to note that even in years where the tornado counts are low , you can still have very violent tornadoes -- 2013 being a perfect example . the year ended being roughly 30 % below normal for the number of tornadoes , yet included some of the strongest tornadoes on record . the twisters in moore and el reno , oklahoma , occurred in may of that year with devastating results . tornadoes fast facts .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     there have been only four tornado watches in 2015 . el nino might be helping keep the numbers down . slow start does n't mean it will be quiet for entire season .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the 1-0 scoreline that took barcelona through to the champions league quarterfinals made their clash with manchester city all seem rather academic . yet it was anything but as lionel messi 's masterful first-half display had some purring once again about his status as the greatest footballer of all time . meanwhile , the second half witnessed another masterclass as england international joe hart somehow kept city in a lively encounter with save after save . in between , the man that city usually rely on to dig them out of tight spots -- sergio aguero -- failed to score a late penalty that could have set up a tense finish . in truth , the english champions deserved little over the two legs as barcelona built upon their 2-1 victory in manchester three weeks ago to go through as 3-1 aggregate winners . the four-time champions may not have added the goals they deserved but they did reach the last eight for the eighth year in a row , a competition record . `` it was a game with a lot of chances where we could have finished it off a lot earlier , '' barca coach luis enrique told reporters . `` we got what we wanted which was to go through to the next round and i am happy with the display . we played well and this is a big boost for us at this stage of the season . '' the high-profile scrutiny of the relationship between coach enrique and argentine superstar lionel messi suddenly seems a distant memory with barca still capable of repeating their wonder year of 2009 . on that occasion , they won the champions league , la liga and spanish super cup under the guidance of pep guardiola , who was one of many enthralled spectators inside the camp nou . now in charge of fellow __quarterfinalists__ bayern munich , guardiola was out of his seat -- seemingly in celebration -- as ivan rakitic opened the scoring after 31 minutes when lifting the ball over hart following a fine pass from messi . the diminutive argentine flashed two free-kicks from distance onto the top of the goal netting while also displaying an array of twists , turns and embarrassing ` __nutmegs__ ' for his opponents . it was enough to make former england international gary lineker , the top scorer at the 1986 world cup , proclaim him the best footballer ever . while that __engrossing__ debate rumbles on , messi set about trying to put the tie to bed but he met fierce resistance from hart , who had kept city in the tie in the first leg when saving the argentine 's injury-time penalty . england 's number one made 10 saves , the most of any keeper in any champions league this season , not only __repelling__ messi but also neymar and suarez , both of whom were also denied by the post in the first half . to their credit , the premier league side -- who were looking to reach the champions league quarterfinals for the first time -- improved after the break but found chances hard to come by . that was until aguero won a penalty after going down under a challenge from first gerard pique , and then argentina colleague javier mascherano , with just over ten minutes left . but dutch keeper marc-andre ter stegen dived right -- in both senses -- to beat away the __spotkick__ and ultimately seal city 's fate . barcelona can now prepare for sunday 's __superclasico__ clash with real madrid , whom they lead in the la liga table by one point . `` we 've gone out to a magnificent side for the second time in two years , '' joe hart told sky sports television . `` they will get a lot of plaudits but we had a big chance with the penalty . '' questions will now be asked of coach manuel pellegrini , who had been expected to perform better in the champions league after roberto mancini twice failed to get out of the group stages . it means that for the second time in three years , no english team have made the last eight , where barca have joined madrid sides real and atletico , bayern munich , monaco , paris saint-germain , porto and juventus . the latter made it through after beating borussia dortmund 3-0 in germany to secure a convincing 5-1 aggregate victory . on a night when manchester city had failed to score , it was not lost on many that their former striker carlos tevez netted twice and made one , converted by alvaro morata , for the italians . `` it was a game to forget . it started badly and did not get any better , '' dortmund coach jurgen klopp , who led his side to the 2013 champions league final , told reporters . `` we deserved to be eliminated . '' the draw for the quarterfinals will be held on friday .

'' ross does n't begin by hammering them with questions . he wants to have a conversation . `` i say , ` what 's gone on in your life ? ' '' the result of that tenderness and patience is ross ' latest collection of photos , `` girls in justice . '' the images are unflinching . they convey the ugliness of a young person 's life behind bars . the pictures are replete with the unique loneliness , anger and boredom of a juvenile detention center . but the girls also tell their stories alongside the images . one photo shows a girl in a tan jumpsuit , hand on her head , sitting alone in a drab , cavernous room . `` i 've been here 17 times , '' one girl says . many of the stories are bleak , reflecting adults who endangered the girls or , at the very least , failed repeatedly to protect them . `` mom 's a stripper . dad was an alcoholic , drug addict , murdered last year , '' said one girl explaining her past . `` they took my brother and i away because my dad chained us in the house and tried to burn it down . i lived with my grandma and uncle . the people who are supposed to love you never do .

'' `` she was just a kid , but she was at that place where you have no hope , '' he said . `` i feel all these stories , but that one just hit me hard . i was sobbing . you want to say , ` it will get better , ' but you also know the system and you know that you ca n't say that . '' ross , the son of a new york city police officer , had a happy upbringing in a home of modest means . he got into a decent amount of trouble growing up , and he said he could have easily wound up in the justice system . but times were different then , he said , and there 's been a cultural turn in america toward __criminalizing__ a child 's bad behavior . he recalls a __detention-center__ director in reno , nevada , who asked him to visit and take photos . at intake , he photographed a __fifth-grader__ who had been taken to jail because he had acted up in class . `` this __fifth-grader__ came up to my belt buckle , '' ross recalled . `` he was drinking warm milk , like someone gave him a cardboard thing of milk . i can still smell that milk . that intake area smelled like elementary school . '' the child 's single mother could n't pick him up for hours . she was holding down a job that would n't allow her to leave until after 6 p.m. . the __detention-center__ director sent ross ' photo to every principal in the area to make a point : children do not belong in lockup , so find another solution . ross is adamant that he 's making photographs to bring about `` immediate change . '' he speaks across the country to law schools and works closely with child welfare advocates . his work has been shown during legislative sessions to illustrate how sorely the juvenile justice system needs fixing . `` i 'm trying to wake people up , make them realize there are lives at stake , '' he said . `` at the same time , i do n't , i ca n't , position myself as the great hope . i might not be able to do much but listen . but i think i 'm a good listener , and i think these kids deserve to tell their stories . '' richard ross is a photographer based in california . you can follow his juvenile in justice project on facebook , twitter and instagram .

'' __kazushige__ __todaka__ , the director of japan 's __kure__ maritime museum , said last week after viewing the information posted by allen that it appeared that the vessel was the __musashi__ , although pictures of the entire body of the ship were needed to know for sure . __todaka__ said , given the location and the depth at which the wreck was found , he was `` 90 % sure '' that the ship was the __musashi__ . `` i was really surprised because the location of the sunken ship has never been identified since it went down , '' he said . `` i have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered , but they all turned out not to be true .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- legendary fashion designers domenico dolce and stefano gabbana are in a public spat with pop music icon elton john over some __eyebrow-raising__ comments the pair made about gay parenting . long against same-sex marriage , the italian designers -- who are not only openly gay , but were once a couple -- took their __counterintuitive__ rhetoric to the next level this weekend when dolce said in an interview : . `` you are born to a mother and a father -- or at least that 's how it should be . i call children of chemistry , synthetic children . rented uterus , semen chosen from a catalog . '' john , who along with his husband david furnish is raising two children that were conceived through ivf , took to twitter to essentially say `` oh no he did n't , '' followed by '' __#boycottdolcegabbana__ '' because nothing expresses anger quite like a hashtag . not to be outdone , the pair responded with __#boycotteltonjohn__ . so what should we make of all this boycott talk ? combined , the three men are worth an estimated $ 3 billion . the openly gay ricky martin , who is raising two boys via a surrogate mother , sided with john -lrb- but he 's only worth an estimated $ 60 million , so i 'm not sure if anyone noticed -rrb- . regardless , while i find the archaic thinking of dolce and gabbana disappointing , the truth is my budget boycotted their clothing years ago . some of it 's really nice . but i just ca n't afford to spend $ 500 on a t-shirt . and even if i could , i do n't know how i would justify doing so with a kid to put through college . that 's why i find this whole ultra rich on ultra rich violence so disconnected from the reality most of us on twitter are living . boycott ? besides the 1 % , who the hell is buying dolce and gabbana regularly enough to actually call the act of not buying their clothing a `` boycott '' ? that 's a little like me saying i 'm upset with the way james dolan is running the new york knicks so i refuse to play for him . even misguided consumers __wallowing__ in debt and living way above their means likely do not have enough credit cards to keep up with the purchasing power of the elton johns of this world . -lrb- no lie -- the online store has a pair of `` polka dot print slim fit denim jeans '' for $ __795__ . and you still have to pay for shipping . and there 's also a cotton vest on sale for $ __795__ . a cotton vest !! -rrb- . here 's an idea : considering it can cost about $ 20,000 for each attempt at ivf , and the procedure has roughly a 40 % success rate , i would say the vast majority of people who were the direct targets of dolce 's words are not using their __expendable__ cash to buy their clothing anyway . if john , martin , courtney love and other __ultra-rich__ celebrities really want to leverage their celebrity to ignite a movement we can buy into -lrb- pun intended -rrb- take that would-be dolce and __gabanna__ money and start an endowment for those who ca n't afford ivf treatments . or consider `` modern family 's '' jesse tyler ferguson , who tweeted he wanted to unload his dolce and __gabanna__ suits in a way that would help those who ca n't afford the ivf treatments . retweeting a hashtag is a great way to publicly shame . but crowdsourcing among the 1 % could make a difference in the lives of people who so desperately want to be parents that they mortgage their homes trying . it also creates a medium in which us regular folks can legitimately express our disappointment in the designers ' words and not take the convenient route via blogs and hashtag activism . and yes , i realize i 'm criticizing myself as well . but i have some self-awareness . when you tweet `` je suis __d&g__ '' -- thus comparing your pr nightmare to the one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in recent europe history -- you do n't .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- an indiana jury sentenced a woman who says she had a miscarriage to 20 years in prison . in 2013 , __purvi__ patel showed up at a hospital emergency room suffering from severe vaginal bleeding . according to court documents , at first she denied that she had been pregnant but later told doctors that she had a miscarriage and delivered a stillborn fetus which , she said , she placed in a bag in a dumpster . patel was later charged with __feticide__ and felony neglect of a dependent , though these charges are decidedly contradictory . `` __feticide__ '' would require patel to have terminated a pregnancy while the fetus was still in the womb . on the other hand , `` felony neglect of a dependent '' requires delivering a live fetus and then neglecting it . as amanda __marcotte__ of slate pointed out in february , patel `` was convicted both of killing a baby and killing a fetus . '' the only thing more preposterous than this is that patel was charged in the first place . the evidence against her has been shaky from the start . initially , police questioned patel when she was still in the hospital without an attorney present . prosecutors would later introduce text messages indicating that patel had purchased __miscarriage-inducing__ drugs , but there was no evidence patel took the drugs . in fact , they did n't show up in blood tests just after she miscarried . nonetheless , after five hours of deliberation , a jury convicted patel of two entirely contradictory crimes based on entirely circumstantial evidence . and on march 30 , 2015 , she was given a __30-year-sentence__ on the felony neglect charge , 10 of which were suspended . she 'll serve a concurrent six-year sentence for __feticide__ . patel is the second pregnant woman to be charged under indiana 's __anti-choice__ `` __feticide__ '' law . in 2011 , __bei__ __bei__ shuai was charged with __feticide__ after she attempted to commit suicide when she was eight months pregnant . in 2013 , lawyers announced shuai had reached a plea agreement just before her trial was set to begin . still , both cases presented troubled pregnant women who needed help from medical authorities and their government . but indiana 's harsh anti-abortion laws , and the broader culture that seeks to control the decisions pregnant women can make about their own bodies , make women far less likely to reach out for this help . conservatives like to say that women are the `` victims of abortion '' and that laws such as the indiana `` __feticide__ '' measure are intended to `` protect '' them . years ago , the president of the __anti-choice__ susan b. anthony list made assurances that the specter of women being prosecuted and jailed under __anti-choice__ laws was nothing more than __fearmongering__ by pro-choice activists . the website of the ohio right to life association similarly argues that `` no one is interested in sending women to jail . '' and in fact , the indiana `` __feticide__ '' law was plainly intended to criminalize `` knowing or intentional termination of another 's pregnancy . '' but there 's no escaping the reality it has been used to turn pregnant women into criminals . so much for not sending women to jail . those who care about the rights of pregnant women should be deeply concerned . after all , patel was convicted based on text messages about __miscarriage-inducing__ drugs , not evidence she had used or even purchased such drugs . in shuai 's case , it was presumed that the intent of her attempted suicide was to terminate her pregnancy and thus she was charged with __feticide__ . so what else might be considered a `` deliberate attempt '' to terminate one 's own pregnancy ? if a woman knew about the risks of too vigorous exercise and miscarriage but exercised anyway ? merely googling __abortion-inducing__ drugs ? telling a friend you 've thought about having an abortion ? the message from __purvi__ patel 's conviction is clear . after all , there have always been and will always be women who try to terminate their pregnancies . laws like indiana 's and cases like patel 's do n't change that . what they do is make women hide , avoid medical attention and put their lives at even greater risk . in texas , which last year enacted some of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the nation and shuttered the majority of its abortion services clinics , abortion rates have indeed declined but not in proportion to the severity of such measures . researchers suggest that 's partly because rates of __self-abortion__ , which then go unreported in the statistics , are increasing . and anecdotal evidence suggests this is the case . before roe v. wade made abortion legal in the united states , according to the __guttmacher__ institute , the number of illegal abortions in the 1950s and 1960s ranged from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year . new __anti-choice__ restrictions and prosecutions wo n't change the fact that women will sometimes choose to terminate their pregnancies . it simply restricts their options to do so . ask yourself : in the case of __purvi__ patel , even if she did intend to __self-abort__ and used black market drugs to do so , and if she indeed delivered a live fetus , would n't we want to live in a society where she would bring that baby to the hospital for life-saving medical attention rather than be so afraid of prosecution that she threw it in a dumpster ? __purvi__ patel is reportedly appealing her conviction . we should all appeal to logic and sanity and compassion and repeal these horrid __anti-choice__ , __anti-pregnancy__ laws .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- australian foreign minister julie bishop says the government is seeking to confirm reports that an australian teenager has carried out a suicide attack on behalf of isis in iraq . `` i can confirm that the australian government is currently seeking to independently verify reports that 18-year-old melbourne teenager jake __bilardi__ has been killed in a suicide bombing attack in the middle east , '' she told reporters . `` if these reports are confirmed , this is another tragic example of a young australian being lured to a senseless and violent death by a brutal terrorist organization that is intent on imposing suffering and misery not only in iraq and syria but beyond . '' on wednesday , isis claimed that `` abu abdullah __al-australi__ , '' along with four other foreign fighters , had been killed while carrying out suicide attacks during an offensive launched on the city of ramadi in iraq . the claim , issued on a twitter account associated with the anbar provincial division of isis , was accompanied by a series of 20 images , including a photo of a young man who looked like __bilardi__ . the image appeared to show __bilardi__ at the wheel of a car with the caption , `` abu abdullah __al-australi__ -lrb- may allah accept him -rrb- , the attacker on the 8th brigade . '' the other attackers hailed from belgium , syria , uzbekistan and the caucasus , the twitter account claimed . victoria police said __bilardi__ first came to their attention when his family reported him missing last year . a search of his family 's home in the melbourne suburb of __craigieburn__ following his disappearance uncovered chemicals that could be used to make an explosive device , police said , although no actual bombs were found . bishop said __bilardi__ 's passport had been canceled in october on the advice of australian security agencies . australian media have reported that __bilardi__ kept a __since-deleted__ blog , written under his alias abu abdullah __al-australi__ . entitled `` from melbourne to ramadi : my journey , '' it reportedly detailed his transition from an `` atheist school student in affluent melbourne to a soldier of the __khilafah__ preparing to sacrifice my life for islam . '' the blog reportedly described a plan to attack targets in melbourne , after an initial attempt to move to iraq or syria failed . `` this plan involved launching a string of bombings across melbourne , targeting foreign consulates and __political/military__ targets as well as grenade and knife attacks on shopping centres and cafes and culminating with myself detonating a belt of explosives amongst the __kuffar__ , '' he wrote , according to the sydney morning herald . member of __bilardi__ 's family have linked the teen 's radicalization to the loss of his mother from cancer . `` he 's just a young boy that went looking for something after he lost someone very very dear to him , his mother , '' his aunt , connie __bilardi__ , told cnn affiliate seven on monday . a former classmate of __bilardi__ 's from melbourne 's __craigieburn__ secondary college described the teen on facebook as a `` shy kid who did n't like to be disturbed '' . `` one day , he randomly got angry at me and tried to punch me , '' he posted . `` always keep an eye out on the quiet ones . '' a former __penpal__ of __bilardi__ told cnn he cut off communication with the teenager about two years ago , when __bilardi__ started posting islamic extremist messages on his facebook page . the friend , who requested not to be named , said he first met __bilardi__ on the website __interpals.net__ about seven years ago . they shared a love for soccer -- __bilardi__ was a supporter of chelsea football club -- and became __penpals__ . __bilardi__ told him about his mother 's death , and confided that he was fighting with his family , because they would not allow him to go overseas to study . the __penpal__ said he started noticing a change in __bilardi__ 's behavior when the teen started posting `` things that supported osama bin laden '' on facebook . `` i got scared , '' the friend said . `` my friends here told me that maybe i should stop talking to him . '' he blocked __bilardi__ on the social networking site about two years ago . after a while , he said , he got curious about how his old __penpal__ was doing . `` i thought he was my friend . i wanted to make sure he was okay ... i sent him an email saying ` are you well ? ' but he never wrote back . '' bishop said that 90 australian citizens are in iraq and syria fighting on the side of isis , and that at least 20 australians have been killed in the conflict . the passports of some 100 australians had been canceled on national security grounds , she said . bishop appealed to young australians `` not to fall victim to this brutal terrorist organization , to not be lured into believing that they 're embarking on some adventure or some romantic endeavor . '' `` this is a brutal organization dedicated to creating misery and hardship , '' she said . `` its activities of beheadings and executions and crucifixions all take us back to the dark ages . '' australian prime minister tony abbott addressed __bilardi__ 's alleged suicide attack in comments to the press thursday . this is a horrific situation -- an absolutely horrific situation -- and it shows the lure of this death cult to impressionable youngsters , '' he said . `` it 's very , very important that we do everything we can to try to safeguard our young people against the lure of this shocking alien and extreme ideology . '' last week , two australian teen brothers were arrested at sydney airport on suspicion of trying to leave the country to join isis . cnn 's jennifer z. deaton , naomi ng and __marilia__ __brocchetto__ contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- gov. mike pence unleashed a firestorm on indiana last week when he signed the religious freedom restoration act . critics of the law contend it could be used by individuals and businesses to discriminate -- particularly against the lgbt community of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender individuals -- on the basis of religion . the ramifications for the __hoosier__ state are just starting to be felt in the form of boycotts , petitions and travel bans . as the controversy mushrooms , here 's what got us to where we are . and where things are headed . last week , pence put his signature on the __rfra__ -- a law that allows indiana businesses to cite their religious freedom as a legal defense . the law states that the government ca n't `` substantially burden a person 's exercise of religion '' and that individuals who feel like their religious beliefs have been or could be `` substantially burdened '' can lean on this law to fend off lawsuits . in an opinion piece in the wall street journal , pence says the __rfra__ `` ensures that indiana law will respect religious freedom and apply the highest level of scrutiny to any state or local governmental action that infringes on people 's religious liberty . '' pence notes that there is no reference to sexual orientation in the law . civil liberties and gay rights groups hold to their stance that the law could be used by businesses to deny service to people based on their sexual orientation and justify that discrimination based on their religious belief . `` silence is consent ! '' tweets laurel __davilia__ , a commentator on brass knuckles progressives radio . from sports teams to musicians to other cities and states , they fell like dominoes . the ncaa , which is headquartered in indianapolis and set to host its men 's basketball final four in the city this week , said the law could lead it to move events elsewhere in future years . the nba , wnba and nfl issued critical statements too . indianapolis colts owner jim irsay says fans of all stripes are welcome . `` the colts have always embraced inclusiveness , tolerance , and a diverse fan base , '' irsay tweets . `` we welcome all fans to colts nation . one family ! '' a petition posted on change.org hopes to get the big ten conference to move its football championship out of indianapolis . `` i think that indiana needs to be told that it must respect all persons regardless of sex , age , religion , gender identity , or sexual orientation , '' sean burke of madison , wisconsin , says in the petition . `` as a football fan , i think we can send a message by calling on the ncaa and big ten conference to take a stand . '' lucas oil stadium in indianapolis is scheduled to host the league 's championship game through the 2021 season . at last check , the petition had more than 11,000 supporters . the mayors of san francisco and seattle have barred spending on travel to indiana . the governors of connecticut and washington state did the same thing . and you can add __wilco__ to the boycott bandwagon . the group is canceling its may 7 show in indianapolis , it says on facebook . `` the ` indiana religious freedom restoration act ' feels like thinly disguised legal discrimination to us , '' __wilco__ says . `` hope to get back to the __hoosier__ state someday soon , when this odious measure is repealed . '' cher is among the artists speaking out . her son chaz bono is a transgender man . '' __#govpence__ is another example of right wing racism , __asault__ on __womans__ rights & hatred of lgbt americans , '' she tweets . indiana 's top two state lawmakers pledged monday to amend the state 's controversial `` religious freedom '' law to clarify that it can not be used to discriminate against gay people . `` this law does not discriminate , and it will not be allowed to do so , '' david long , the indiana senate president pro __tem__ , said during a news conference with state house speaker brian __bosma__ . pence had said earlier that he was working with lawmakers to clarify the law . critics still were n't on board with the anti-discrimination claims . opponents of __rfra__ marched around the state capitol . someone even created a satire ad : `` indiana . it 's a great place to be a bigot . '' . the rhetoric has reached such a fever pitch that a front page editorial in tuesday 's edition of the indianapolis star __blares__ the headline : `` fix . this . now . '' the editorial suggests the __rfra__ and protections for gays and lesbians can co-exist . the state is at a crossroads it says . '' -lrb- n -rrb- o matter its original intent -lrb- the law -rrb- already has done enormous harm to our state and potentially our economic future , '' according to the editorial . `` only bold action -- action that sends an unmistakable message to the world that our state will not tolerate discrimination against any of its citizens -- will be enough to reverse the damage . '' the editorial closes with : . `` governor , indiana is in a state of crisis . it is worse than you seem to understand . `` you must act with courage and wisdom . you must lead us forward now . you must ensure that all __hoosiers__ have strong protections against discrimination . `` the laws can co-exist . and so can we . '' some of the gop 's top figures are backing pence despite the controversy . jeb bush and marco rubio have voiced their support . both are considered likely republican candidates for the white house . sen. ted cruz , who announced his candidacy last week , is also on board . `` i 'm proud to stand with gov. __@mike_pence__ for religious liberty , and i urge americans to do the same , '' cruz tweets . indiana is the 20th state to adopt a `` religious freedom restoration '' law , most of which are modeled after the religious freedom restoration act , which president bill clinton signed into law in 1993 . but that law passed with the backing of a broad-based coalition and was n't set against the backdrop of gay rights or the wave of marriage equality laws that have swept the country in recent years . adam talbot , a spokesman with the human rights campaign , a gay rights group , stresses that those 20 laws are `` dramatically different in their scope and effect . '' `` calling them similar in this way risks being misleading . indiana is the broadest and most dangerous law of its kind in the country , '' talbot says . arkansas ' legislature passed an __indiana-style__ law on friday , which now heads to the state 's governor for approval . despite the controversy , the indiana governor says concerns that his state 's new `` religious freedom '' law will allow businesses to turn away lgbt customers is the result of a `` tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding . '' still , he was hard pressed to explain why that was n't the case . given a chance on sunday to add some clarity , pence refused to answer at least six __yes-or-no__ questions from abc 's george stephanopoulos about whether the measure __legalizes__ discrimination against gays and lesbians . jeremy diamond and eric __bradner__ contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- a florida `` dream ticket , '' two nuggets about leadership questions in congress and coming tests for sen. ted cruz and ohio gov. john kasich filled our final march trip around the `` inside politics '' table . 1 . another `` draft warren '' movement ? if you follow politics , you have heard this one : liberals say elizabeth warren has to run for president because hillary clinton is too cozy with wall street . and now that senate minority leader harry reid is planning to retire -- creating an opening in the top senate democratic job -- you are about to hear this : warren has to run for leader because chuck schumer is too cozy with wall street . the senator from massachusetts is likely to give the same answer as she did on a presidential run , but jackie kucinich of the daily beast says the liberal clamoring tells us something about anxiety on the left . `` what this does show is there is a lot of skepticism with the base with chuck schumer , because he 's so close to wall street , and it 's an issue they 've really been hammering on , '' kucinich said . `` so watch for more of that , because i have a feeling that they are going to make their voices heard , through warren or not . '' 2 . a good week for boehner . yes , you read that right . it has been a rocky year for house speaker john boehner , but his allies think they may have just turned a corner . the house of representatives passed the republican budget last week as well as a big medicare change known as the `` doc fix '' because it __clarifies__ reimbursement rates to medicare providers . npr 's __juana__ summers shared reporting on how team boehner hopes that ending the month with a little momentum will carry over when other big legislative battles come to the fore . `` part of -lrb- his success -rrb- is because of the speaker 's willingness to use unconventional tactics , to work with democrat nancy pelosi for that medicare reform , '' summers said . `` congress has a lot of big deadlines when they return . so whether or not he can hold onto that power instead of seeing it slip will be really fascinating . '' 3 . __bush-rubio__ ? __rubio-bush__ ? watch the real estate listings ! jeb bush and sen. marco rubio both call florida home . and both want to be the republican nominee for president . they also happen to be on friendly terms . so among florida republicans who love them both -- there is talk of a `` dream ticket .

'' 4 . ted cruz wants to `` rock '' the youth vote . much was made of the fact that liberty university students had no choice but to attend the campus __convocation__ at which ted cruz announced his bid for the republican presidential nomination . but it gave cruz a big crowd -- and robert costa of the washington post reports that team cruz is determined to build a relationship with young conservatives such as those on hand for the announcement . `` he 's playing at a lot of happy hours with young conservatives in the coming weeks and months , '' costa said . `` and he really believes he can ignite those young conservatives , who are n't really familiar with bush and are looking for someone new . '' 5 . is kasich waiting for a `` summer wave '' ? john kasich had a well-regarded visit to new hampshire last week . and he got a decent buzz out of a new york fund-raising stop , too . so is he ready to launch and join the crowded gop 2016 presidential field ? not so fast . two new hampshire republicans keeping close tabs on gop visitors say he would n't give a firm answer about his intentions -- something they took as a hesitation to run . a national gop source plugged into to the kasich operation says the governor has n't made a firm decision , and is talking about waiting until the summer to make a final call . that , too , is interpreted widely as a reluctance to run . this national source said kasich is one of two gop governors who want to wait and see if those in the current field stumble after their official spring __rollouts__ and create an opening for a `` summer wave '' of new entries . the other , according to this source , is gop michigan gov. rick snyder .

ARTICEL:     washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- there should be plenty of pent-up anticipation among cherry blossom fans in washington this spring . peak blooms are expected at the tail end of the __three-week-long__ national cherry blossom festival , which kicks off friday and runs through april 12 . the fluttering pink and white blossoms are expected to hit their peak between april 11 and april 14 . here are five things to know about the eagerly awaited d.c. blossoms : . the city 's first cherry trees were destroyed . in 1910 , 2,000 cherry trees arrived in washington , thanks to a gift from the city of tokyo and the advocacy of eliza __ruhamah__ __scidmore__ , one of the first female board members of the national geographic society . these trees , however , were riddled with disease and were destroyed . two years later , first lady helen herron taft planted one of the first of more than 3,000 replacement trees sent from japan . winter 's almost over : see the proof . the festival was launched more than 20 years later . it was n't until 1935 that civic groups and the d.c. government came together to hold the first `` cherry blossom festival . '' that first official festival came after smaller commemorations including a three-day celebration in 1934 and a 1927 re-enactment of the original planting of the trees by a group of washington school children . it 's not all about cherry trees . that 's right , there 's a blossom kite festival right in the middle of the cherry blossom festivities on march 28th . the festival consists of a hot tricks showdown , learning how to make and fly kites , and there 's even a kite doctor on site to repair broken kites . two types of trees dominate . in the 1912 gift of trees to washington , there were 12 different varieties . today , two varieties are dominant -- __yoshino__ and __kwanzan__ . __kwanzan__ trees are usually found in the east potomac park area and produce pink blossoms . the __yoshino__ , which produce white blossoms , are closer to the northern part of the tidal basin near the washington monument . descendants of the original trees live in japan . in 2011 , about 120 trees __propagated__ from d.c. 's surviving 1912 trees were sent back to japan to preserve the genetic lineage of the symbolic trees . over the years , cuttings from the original trees have also been returned to japan for horticultural projects .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the end of `` jinx , '' the six-part hbo documentary about real estate heir robert durst , has launched a debate about whether some potentially incriminating statements durst made while in the bathroom to a microphone may be used in his criminal prosecution . durst , as you probably heard , is charged with murder in a killing in california 15 years ago , and he has been suspected , but never charged , in the disappearance of his first wife in new york . whether or not the taped words of an accused person will be admissible against him involves a look at the rules of evidence and the constitution , as well as our __fast-evolving__ ideas about privacy . while durst 's attorneys can make a number of arguments to suppress these statements and bar their admission at trial , the bathroom confessions will likely be factored in . let 's go over three main reasons why : . 1 . is this inadmissible hearsay ? probably not . hearsay is defined as a statement made outside of court that is offered in court for its truth . it really just means a witness ca n't testify at trial about someone else 's version of the facts . if a sentence starts with `` he told me '' or `` she said that , '' it 's probably hearsay . as general proposition , hearsay is supposed to be inadmissible , but the exceptions nearly swallow the rule itself -- so much so that many commentators have suggested __abolishment__ of the __exception-riddled__ rule itself . perhaps the largest and best known category of hearsay exceptions is admissions and confessions . these can be admitted against a defendant . why ? well , the idea is that these statements are reliable . the thinking is that people do n't ordinarily confess to something unless they did it . 2 . is this a violation of durst 's constitutional privilege against self-incrimination ? again , probably not . the rules of the u.s. constitution are a different matter . the fifth amendment 's self-incrimination clause states that '' -lsb- n -rsb- o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself ... '' by definition then , compulsory self-incrimination requires , well , `` compulsion . '' and not just any compulsion . the kind of compulsion targeted by the fifth amendment is governmental coercion . durst may still contend that his `` confession '' was n't voluntary . it 's true that confessions deemed `` involuntary '' are often excluded at trial under the due process clause of the 14th amendment . however , a confession will only be considered involuntary if it is the product of police activity . __voluntariness__ is not an issue when admissions are made to a private person , such as a journalist . what of durst 's likely claim that the filmmakers were essentially acting as an arm of the police ? sometimes law enforcement exercises so much control over a civilian that his private actions become police action , constitutionally speaking . this is not an easy case for a defendant to make , though . durst would have to establish that the hbo interviewers were direct agents of the police and that the interview was coerced by police . the police undoubtedly benefited from the work of these citizen __documentarians__ . but the police frequently benefit from the work of good samaritans or citizens volunteering information , photos or iphone videos . the television show `` america 's most wanted '' has been __premised__ on this idea for decades . given the defendant 's burden here , it 's unlikely that he can convince a judge that , in light of all the circumstances , filmmakers acted as an instrument or agent of police . the bottom line is this : a voluntary confession must be the product of a rational intellect and a free will , not physical intimidation or psychological pressure . how was durst `` pressured '' when alone in the bathroom ? however , his attorneys might argue that some mental impairment rendered him incapable of the necessary rational intellect and free will . 3 . can durst argue for some `` reasonable expectation of privacy '' that was violated by his being taped in the bathroom ? not in our modern world , and not in this case . perhaps in decades past , a court might be offended at an audio recording of someone in the bathroom , but things have changed . subjects of documentaries and reality tv stars alike routinely sign contracts allowing camera crews to pin a microphone to their __lapels__ and follow them around 24 hours a day . moreover , everyone in the television news business has a story about some famous correspondent going to the bathroom and forgetting about their `` hot '' mic . in this brave new media world , the rule appears to be : you wear a __lavalier__ microphone at your own risk . this is why defense attorneys tell clients to not give interviews . no matter how good an __interviewee__ a client may be , audio and video editors have an uncanny knack for isolating the less than flattering sound bites . admitting to killing `` them all '' would fall into this category . when it comes to giving interviews , it 's probably better for defendants such as durst to keep silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt , especially doubt of the reasonable kind .

'' timberlake has had fun with the stomp over the years , even donning a `` i still hate __laettner__ '' t-shirt that was given to him and posing with fans when kentucky and duke played a couple years ago . he jokes that he 's not sure if he was `` a true __hater__ '' of __laettner__ like so many others . but that game will never quite sit well with kentucky players and fans . however , timberlake says the documentary gave him a new perspective on __laettner__ that he thought he 'd never have . `` i can really respect his accomplishments , his basketball career and his passion for the game , '' timberlake says . do n't get him wrong . timberlake still bleeds kentucky blue . he 'd love to see kentucky play duke for the title this year , this time with the wildcats walking away as the winners . face off against your favorite anchors in the cnn march madness bracket challenge .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- on october 24 , 1944 , u.s. warplanes swarmed at the __leviathan__ of __battleships__ , japan 's __musashi__ , splashing down torpedoes or dive bombing it . it took them four hours and more than 25 direct hits to put one of the two largest war ships in world war ii to the bottom of the philippines ' __sibuyan__ sea . this month , microsoft co-founder paul allen and a team of researchers found a sprawling undersea wreck after an eight-year search for the __musashi__ . japanese maritime expert __kazushige__ __todaka__ is 90 % sure they found the right ship after the first images were published earlier in march . and that 's a breakthrough . `` i have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered , but they all turned out not to be true , '' __todaka__ said . unfortunately , japanese war ships did not bear their names on their sides , so a full identification takes a while . but the wreckage matched the ship 's description , and it had a mount for the imperial japanese navy seal , a __chrysanthemum__ which was made out of __teak__ and rotted away in the ship 's 70 years in the sea . on thursday , paul allen 's team treated the world to a live tour from the wreck at nearly 4,000 feet under the waves . an unmanned vehicle 's spotlights lit up the pitch darkness , revealing crisp high definition images of massive rusted iron in crystal clear turquoise water . the live tour began with one of the __musashi__ 's many death blows -- a warped bow . `` what we see here is torpedo damage , '' said robert kraft , the expedition 's leader . torpedoes usually punctured the hull and exploded inside the ship , __belling__ the metal outward . the remote operated vehicle __puttered__ past more fatal damage , as kraft and his team described it . a big dent pushing inward , he explained , was likely from a torpedo that barely missed the ship , exploding outside the hull , pushing it in . `` it 's the __concussive__ force next to the ship , '' he said . the submersible showed multiple hits right under the __musashi__ 's main gun , perhaps the most powerful naval cannon at that time . it weighed 270 tons , and gunners had to duck into a blast shelter before firing it to keep from getting killed . while in the __musashi__ 's death throes , the gun discharged one time before everyone took cover and blew sailors off the ship 's deck , allen 's researchers said . it was one of three such guns followed by rows of other guns . the __musashi__ was the most heavily armed ship of its time , the researchers said . but the giant had an achilles heel . it was very vulnerable to torpedoes . the ship caught fire ; it lost most of its propeller power and began to __flail__ . u.s. warplanes went in for the kill . `` no defenses would have saved her , '' an expedition member commented , as the submersible drifted past one gun turret or gun mount after the next . as the __musashi__ sank , parts of it , where air was trapped imploded . the wreck landed in pieces on the sea floor with some 1,000 crew members . about 1,300 more were rescued by other japanese ships , including the executive officer . the camera appeared to spare viewers any skeletal remains , but among __unfired__ shells and bent iron , small objects peered at the lens . could the small chain have been a necklace ? pocket watch chain ? those wanting to answer those questions themselves will find the recording of the tour archived on allen 's website . launched in 1940 , the __musashi__ was , at the time , in the largest class of warship ever constructed , displacing more than 69,000 tons . it had a twin , the __yamato__ . the u.s. navy sank the __musashi__ during the battle of the __sibuyan__ sea , part of the battle of leyte gulf in the central philippines . microsoft billionaire allen has said his long fascination with world war ii history was inspired by his father 's service in the u.s. army . to finally arrive at the wreck , kraft 's team scoured historical records from four countries and undersea __topographical__ data before sending down detection devices , such as the __bluefins__ that have searched for missing airliner malaysia airlines flight 370 . nearly a decade passed before they had the wreck in their sites . `` that moment of discovery was exhilarating , '' kraft said . cnn 's euan __mckirdy__ , jethro mullen , yoko wakatsuki and brad __lendon__ contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- lewis hamilton has conquered the world of formula one but becoming a global superstar is a far __bumpier__ ride . sporting ability has been transformed into lasting celebrity by footballers like pele and david beckham and nba star michael jordan . at the age of 30 -- and with the fastest car in the world at his fingertips -- hamilton is at the peak of his powers . during sunday 's season-opening australian grand prix in melbourne , millions of hardcore hamilton fans will bite their fingernails and hold their breath when their hero returns to the track in his mercedes racing car . but will the briton 's quest for a third world title in 2015 even register with the average joe ? half a billion tv viewers watch f1 across the year , a figure which pales in comparison with the 4.7 billion football fans who watch the english premier league over the course of a season . jon __stainer__ , managing director of leading sport and entertainment market research company __repucom__ , argues that hamilton , however , is already gaining wider recognition . `` on a global scale lewis already sits in the top half of all celebrities across sport , arts and music , '' he told cnn . __repucom__ monitors celebrity trends by a monthly survey of the general public where 5,000 famous faces are rated according to certain parameters . those who rank in their study of the world 's __top-20__ faces includes actors angelina jolie and leonardo dicaprio , singers madonna and jennifer lopez , footballer beckham and microsoft co-founder and philanthropist bill gates . `` we look at celebrity awareness and other metrics like __likeability__ , whether they are seen as __trendsetters__ , the level of trust people place in them and whether people aspire to have a life like that celebrity . `` we are starting to see lewis go beyond the traditional formula one audience into the mainstream audience . `` some of that is spurred on by his on-off relationship with -lsb- former girlfriend -rsb- nicole scherzinger . those stories put him in the headlines beyond the back pages . '' hamilton split from popstar and tv personality scherzinger for the fourth time in february after a __seesawing__ seven-year relationship . he may no longer be one half of motorsport 's `` posh and becks '' but he 's not been shy of socializing with stars from other spheres . just 10 days before the australian gp , hamilton was partying at paris fashion week with musician and producer kanye west and his wife kim kardashian . mixing with celebrity friends has raised hamilton 's profile , and for some of his fans that is part of his appeal , but there is also a danger of alienating his __petrolhead__ devotees . the famous friends , bright red private jet -- complete with traveling pampered pooches roscoe and coco -- and forays into song writing might be at odds with the perceived image of a feisty f1 world champion . marketing expert steve martin , who worked with hamilton in his role as ceo of __m&c__ saatchi sport and entertainment , warned the driver 's lifestyle could be `` a bit __showy__ . '' `` i 'm not sure if in any walk of life people like __showy__ people , '' he told cnn . `` and so why should that be different on the international stage in a sporting context ? '' christopher thomas , a hamilton __super-fan__ from new york , says : `` hanging out with top celebrities is n't a problem as long as it does n't interfere with his ability to race . `` as long as he shows up to the race and does what he 's supposed to , everything is fine . '' hamilton has often split opinion with his emotional approach to racing . unlike his seemingly unflappable mercedes teammate nico rosberg , the briton races with his heart on his sleeve . for some , that passionate impulse is exactly what draws them to him . `` lewis is cautious and aggressive all at the same time , '' says brazilian fan melissa , who shows her support for the mercedes driver by referring to herself as mel `` hamilton . '' `` sometimes i think i will have a heart attack watching him ! `` he does not live by certain standards . he is not hiding . he is authentic . '' thomas agrees : `` he 's so popular because you see him show his emotions . he stays true to himself . '' hamilton 's fiery responses have helped make him a fearless , instinctive driver who gives no ground on track . consider the mental resolve required to win both his world titles at the final race of the season -- or , in the case of his 2008 triumph with mclaren in brazil , at the very last corner . but then there have been the meltdowns , which reached their nadir in a tumultuous 2011 season when hamilton had an ongoing spat with ferrari driver felipe massa -- at one point calling his driving skills `` __frickin__ ' ridiculous '' -- and controversially criticized the race stewards in monaco . `` a lot of commentators __diss__ lewis for being open about his emotional life , '' says tom __roope__ , whose company the __rumpus__ room creates hamilton 's digital media . `` there is that __marmite-ness__ -- you either love him or hate him . `` but i think people like the fact that he 's not running around trying to be perfect . '' his __hot-blooded__ impulses do allow a fleeting glimpse into the real hamilton . following hamilton at grands prix over the last six years , he 's not a very visible driver compared to others who can be seen chatting with team members and guests inside the __motorhomes__ . he is courteous and friendly in media briefings , where he will often chew on a handful of sweets , but it is hard to get beyond the façade of the __pr-trained__ f1 driver and understand what he is really like . marketing and pr expert martin believes hamilton could improve his global popularity by opening up a little more . `` if i were to do one or two things , i 'd like to make him more natural , to make him relax and be more comfortable in his own skin , '' advised martin , whose clients include footballer cristiano ronaldo , another athlete who has successfully transcended his sport . `` when he talks to use a language that is n't so robotic . humility and having a common touch is a very big skill that people forget . `` beckham is the best example , he can show humility , he 's down to earth , he 's a __smiler__ and he takes the highs and lows in his career very well . `` he has that continuous appeal that is so enduring , and you can take a lot of lessons from that . '' if hamilton is to extend his celebrity beyond the sporting sphere , he could do well to follow beckham 's example in another area too -- philanthropy . the former manchester united , real madrid and la galaxy star retired two years ago but he has been an ambassador for children 's charity unicef for the last decade . he and his __popstar-turned-fashion-designer__ wife victoria have their own charitable trust . when beckham signed for french club paris saint-germain in 2013 he also donated his multi-million dollar wages to charity . hamilton has also contributed to unicef 's campaigns and during a break last season he traveled to haiti to see first hand the charity 's work there with malnourished children . `` being involved in charity and community work is a way lewis can develop his appeal beyond f1 and the sport audience , '' suggests __stainer__ . `` that 's how beckham managed to mold and transform his character and __marketability__ towards the end of his playing career . `` lewis can also touch the lives of more people but that is a difficult thing to do when you 're at the peak of your career . '' martin agrees that having a strategy for his career beyond sport is absolutely essential to maintaining a high profile . `` we 've worked with lewis for a number of years and he 's been brilliant but it 's not about living in the moment , it 's about having a plan that evolves , '' he added . `` how does he make sure his appeal is so enduring that it lasts beyond his formula one career ? '' hamilton still has plenty of racing left in the tank . ferrari 's kimi raikkonen is the oldest driver on the 2015 grid and the finn will turn 36 in october . for now , at least , there is one relatively easy way for hamilton , allied with mercedes ' powerful car , to crank up his kudos . `` win more championships , '' says thomas . `` and win more races in the u.s. and canada . `` f1 is still growing in the u.s. and when it comes to celebrity status the u.s. has a big deal to do with what happens globally . `` if you 're a celebrity in the u.s. then it transcends outwards into other countries . '' could winning a third world title with mercedes push hamilton into the ranks of f1 's greatest drivers and deeper into the public consciousness ? `` he 's the favorite in 2015 because the mercedes gap to the others is so big that even if it 's reduced , it 's probably still going to be there , '' hamilton 's biographer mark hughes told cnn over the winter . `` lewis is in a position to make it a great career and if he keeps winning titles he will be recognized as one of the giants . '' hamilton has already raced his way to riches from rags , becoming f1 's first black star , a winner of 33 grands prix and two world titles , against a backdrop of racing rivalry and a rocky celebrity romance . on sunday , another chapter will be written in the double world champion 's rollercoaster story when the 2015 season fires up around melbourne 's albert park . so , what next ? `` lewis is a bit like a soap opera , '' says __roope__ . `` it 's amazing how much drama there is around him . '' `` you need to create a story around somebody to have ongoing appeal , '' says martin . `` what makes great sports people , the ones that fans like over time , are those who come back from tremendous highs and lows -- that 's a great story . ''

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- he 's a rolls royce footballer who honed his game in his parents ' garage . and even at the age of 40 , former juventus star alessandro del piero is still purring along , showing no signs of running out of gas . the record-breaking striker is currently enjoying an indian summer to his football career , completing stints at sydney fc in australia and more recently at the delhi __dynamos__ in the inaugural indian super league . inevitably , the time will come when he finally decides to hang up his boots but that does n't look like happening anytime soon -- not when he 's still enjoying himself so much . `` about football , i love every single moment -- the life with teammates , the atmosphere before a game , the free kicks , the goals . i love every moment like the first one , '' del piero told cnn 's human to hero series . the man dubbed `` il __pinturicchio__ '' -lrb- `` the little artist '' -rrb- has enjoyed a glittering career for both country and club in italy . during 19 seasons at juventus he won 15 trophies including six serie a crowns and a european champions league title , as well as setting club records for appearances and goals . in all , del piero made __705__ appearances for the __bianconeri__ -- including a record __478__ in serie a -- and scored 289 goals along the way . `` i 'm very proud about the records because i do everything for the club . i 've had some great moments with the club , with the fans -lrb- and -rrb- with my teammates , '' he says . raised in the town of __conegliano__ in northern italy , del piero 's love for football was fostered by his late father , gino . `` my childhood was fantastic . i trained and played every moment and in every space of my home , '' he recalls . `` you know northern italy is very cold -- you can not play outside , so my father would move the car out of the garage to give me more space . i would play alone , with my schoolmates and try to imagine in my mind what it means to be a footballer . '' del piero turned professional at the age of 17 , joining serie b side __padova__ in 1991 before being snapped up by juventus for $ 2.6 million two years later . his longstanding relationship with the `` old lady , '' as juventus is affectionately known , got off on the right foot almost from the start . del piero scored five times in 11 appearances in his debut season before making his breakthrough the following year , becoming a first-team regular standing in for injured star striker roberto __baggio__ . the two men would go on to share a dressing room at international level , with both netting 27 times for their country , but their defining moments for the azzurri could not have been more contrasting . while __baggio__ will forever be remembered for missing a penalty kick that handed brazil victory in the 1994 fifa world cup final , del piero has cause to reflect on happier times on football 's biggest stage . after being part of two unsuccessful campaigns in 1998 and 2002 , del piero and italy hit the jackpot in 2006 in germany , beating france on penalties in a final remembered primarily for zinedine zidane 's headbutt on italy defender marco __materazzi__ . victory in the final was a `` beautiful '' moment but del piero 's most cherished memory of that tournament happened a few days earlier . `` the most special moment in my head , and probably the heads of my teammates , was the semifinal , '' he says . `` definitely the final , when you take the cup and lift it to the sky , it 's beautiful . but the semifinal was the most exciting . we played the home team for 120 minutes . there is a big connection between our two countries . it was incredible . '' an epic battle looked to be heading for penalties after a goalless 90 minutes , with extra time going the same way , before fabio __grosso__ netted in the __119th__ minute followed by a del piero effort moments later . `` i ca n't hide that my greatest victory is the world cup . since you 're a kid you think you want to win that . it was massive , '' he says . italy 's third world cup triumph came against a backdrop of turmoil in italy 's domestic league as juventus and other serie a teams were implicated in the `` __calciopoli__ '' match-fixing scandal . the repercussions would see former juventus managing director luciano __moggi__ banned for life by the italian football authorities while the club was stripped of two serie a titles won in 2005 and 2006 , relegated to serie b and docked nine points . the demotion to italy 's second tier saw some top players leave the club , including italy captain fabio cannavaro , france defender lilian __thuram__ and sweden striker zlatan ibrahimovic . but the __ever-faithful__ del piero stayed put , helping juventus secure the serie b title and an immediate return to the top flight . `` i think that staying with juventus in serie b , even before i knew how large the points penalty was going to be , was the best decision i could 've made , '' del piero said last year . `` i had an extraordinary season that gave extra meaning to everything that came afterwards , including the -lrb- serie a -rrb- trophy i lifted on the last game at the juventus stadium . '' del piero also scored in that final league match against atalanta in may 2012 and was afforded a hero 's send-off with a 20-minute standing ovation after his substitution in the second half . `` there were many people crying that day . i was very emotional . i tried to hide my tears by bowing down to pick up some __scarfs__ and cleaning my eyes . it was a very special and touching moment ... it will stay with me forever , '' he recalls . a open letter to juventus ' fans confirmed his exit the following july before signing a two-year deal to play for sydney fc in australia 's a-league in a deal worth __aus$__ 4 million -lrb- $ 3 million -rrb- . he was soon helping repay that fee , netting a trademark free kick on his home debut -- one of 24 goals scored during his time down under . del piero has since gone on to help promote the new indian super league , appearing in the inaugural competition late last year . so what plans does the veteran have for 2015 ? `` my future plan is to find a good restaurant tonight and have a rest and then tomorrow is another day , '' he says cheekily before suggesting that his playing days may not be over just yet . `` i have two or three situations to analyze . i want to take some time to make a good decision like i did in the past , '' he adds . `` i would love to play again , i want to play with good people around me . i 'm still training now -- i want to keep myself ready for a big decision .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the story of the jews in the united states is a testament to `` american exceptionalism '' and stands in contrast to a long history of discrimination and pariah status in europe and muslim lands . in fact , the economic prosperity and social standing of america 's jews shows that generally they have fared better than many other minorities . this positive record is a fulfillment of the assurance given to the newport , rhode island , hebrew congregation in __1790__ by president george washington : `` it is now no more that __toleration__ is spoken of as if it were the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights , for , happily , the government of the united states ... gives to bigotry no sanction , to persecution no assistance . '' since then , american jews have been appointed and elected to public offices as governors , senators , mayors , cabinet officers and in the military , and today , most american adults are unaware of and do n't seem to care who 's jewish . thus it comes as a shock when at the university of california los angeles , a jewish woman student applicant for the student council 's judicial board is initially rejected after being asked : `` given that you are a jewish student and very active in the jewish community , how do you see yourself being able to maintain an unbiased view ? '' according to the new york times , the discussion that followed had `` seemed to echo the kind of questions , prejudices and __tropes__ -- particularly about divided loyalties -- that have plagued jews across the globe for centuries . '' the minutes and video of the event suggest some student leaders seemed to be auditioning for the salem witch trials and others for jobs as political __commissars__ in communist north korea . and in february , at another university of california campus in davis , jewish students opposed to a student council resolution advocating a boycott of israel were heckled by cries of `` allahu akbar '' and a jewish fraternity house was daubed with a swastika . chancellor gene block of ucla called the dust up on his campus a `` __teachable__ moment . '' yes , agreed . it seems ucla 's diverse body of students requires remedial classes in civics . would ucla students consider it appropriate to ask u.s. supreme court justices ruth bader ginsburg and elena kagan similarly hostile and demeaning questions ? apparently it 's necessary for the university to teach its student leadership that the u.s. constitution bans religious tests for public office . while they are at it , they also can inform them that the bill of rights assures freedom of religion , speech and assembly to all citizens . california 's university administrators might need to be reminded that title 6 of the civil rights act of 1964 applies to all americans , and they have an obligation to ensure equal educational opportunity for all students . this includes , among other things , promptly and effectively addressing certain hostile environments . as for the uc davis students , they need to learn that support for israel is a legitimate american tradition . a century ago , supreme court justice louis d. __brandeis__ asserted : `` __zionism__ is the pilgrim inspiration and impulse all over again ... to be good americans , we must be better jews , and to be better jews , we must become zionists . '' students are of course free to disagree with __brandeis__ but not to harass or intimidate jews who support his argument . the events in california might be regarded as isolated incidents and youthful excesses of the type that has always marked campus life . except of course that is not true . this type of hatred , stereotyping and bias is a worrying new development that suggests a generational problem . in our recent study , my trinity college colleague , __ariela__ __keysar__ , and i found that 54 % of jewish students reported experiencing or witnessing __ant-semitism__ on campus during the six months of september __2013-march__ 2014 . our survey covered __1,157__ jewish students on 55 campuses . the patterns and high rates of anti-semitism that were reported were surprising . another finding was that female students were more likely than males -lrb- 58 % versus 51 % -rrb- to report anti-semitism . jewish women seem more vulnerable on campus today . america 's universities need to foster american exceptionalism and values . they should take special care to avoid following current `` european fashion trends . '' the situation in france today demonstrates the price of failing to nip youthful extremism in the bud . twenty years ago , complaints by jewish students in paris that they were subject to anti-semitism from a strange coalition of marxist , fascist and islamist groups were ignored by complacent university and government officials . the dangerous streets of paris are witness to what results when a country ignores problems and __panders__ to extremist opinions . the army is currently deployed across france to protect synagogues and jewish community buildings . but history has taught us what begins with the jews does n't end with the jews . the french army also has to defend the nation 's shopping malls , government buildings and of course , its cartoonists .

'' so far , north korean state media has not issued any statement about the invitation . this year 's victory day marks the 70th anniversary of the soviet union 's victory over nazi germany in world war ii . chatter over whether kim would make his first official overseas trip during the pivotal anniversary started in late december after russian state media reported that moscow had extended an invitation to pyongyang . on december 22 , russian presidential aide yuri __ushakov__ told itar-tass : `` first signals are given from pyongyang that the north korean leader plans to come to moscow and attend celebrations . '' recently , russia and north korea have been fostering warmer relations . if kim appears in russia along with other world leaders , he may look like a minor figure , said dr. leonid petrov , an asian studies professor who specializes in the political history of north korea . `` in a setting with a large crowd of state officials , in group pictures , he would look like a minor figure instead of what he 's portrayed in north korean media as supreme leader , invincible marshal , jack of all trades . `` so i think if kim jong un decides to go to moscow , he 's going to look like a very lonely , lonely figure . '' the kremlin has invited 68 world leaders to its victory day celebrations on may 9 , said russian foreign minister sergey lavrov as quoted on russian network __rt.__ . he was quoted in russian media as saying that chinese president xi jinping will also attend . in the last year , russia and north korea , two historical allies , have increasingly established stronger ties as russian president vladimir putin faces international backlash over the war in ukraine . the two countries declared 2015 their `` friendship year . '' both countries have been slapped with sanctions by the united states and are facing international isolation . `` north korea is a convenient friend for moscow -- it 's anti-american and it 's in a key place of asia , '' petrov said . `` russia lost many of its traditional allies -- it needs friends , both economically , politically , strategically . '' ties between north korea and russia date back to world war ii , when kim jong un 's grandfather and founder of the country , kim il sung , trained as a communist guerrilla leader in the soviet union . throughout kim 's subsequent reign , the soviet union backed the nation . after the soviet union crumbled in the early 1990s , north korea became increasingly reliant on china . kim 's father , kim jong il , visited moscow several times , with his last visit in 2011 . the late kim rode into russia in an armored train -lrb- he disliked flying -rrb- and met with both putin and prime minister dmitry medvedev . `` moscow undertook a diplomatic offensive '' with north korea , said petrov , of australian national university . `` it absolved $ 10 billion of soviet-era debts from the account books and started __rebooting__ relationships between north korea and russia . '' last year , russia forgave 90 % of north korea 's $ 11 billion debt . cnn 's alla eshchenko reported in moscow , and madison park wrote and reported in hong kong . cnn 's jessica king contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- israel 's ruling likud party pulled off a victory in tuesday 's election -- and it was a stunning one . during the campaign , incumbent prime minister benjamin netanyahu had come in for heavy criticism from across the political spectrum , for reasons ranging from concerns over his frosty relationship with the white house , to his fixation on the iran nuclear issue , to allegations over netanyahu 's household expenses . yet despite this __unpromising__ backdrop , likud is on course to win 30 seats in the knesset , six seats more than the main opposition zionist union -- headed by isaac herzog and __tsipi__ livni , and an obvious favorite of the israeli media establishment and europe , washington , and the west bank . the blow to the zionist union is particularly painful because some opinion polls had actually had the party leading likud as the campaign drew to a close . -lrb- likud was n't the only winner of the night -- the new center-right party __kulanu__ -lrb- all of us -rrb- , which focuses on the economy , also had a good showing , securing 10 seats -rrb- . still , likud 's resounding has n't settled the eventual makeup of the government -- in the coming weeks , the work of negotiating a coalition will begin . with this in mind , there is a good chance that president __reuven__ __rivlin__ will ask netanyahu to form a national unity government , either with the zionist union , or as the head of a right-wing coalition -lrb- although the bitter rivalry between __herzog/livni__ and netanyahu during the campaign makes the latter more likely -rrb- . overall , the election results seemed to reflect the __rightward__ shift of the electorate , with even voters who __self-identify__ as centrists consistently expressing conservative positions on both the palestinian issue and broader questions of national security . meanwhile , the numbers for the left in tuesday 's election -- a four seats for __meretz__ , 24 for the zionist union and 14 for the arab list suggests the bloc is some 20 seats short of a viable coalition . as a result , the international community and the palestinian leadership will have to face the reality that negotiations over the palestinian state will be conducted with the center-right . so , what can we expect from the new netanyahu government ? issues that dominated the campaign , namely security and the economy , will likely dominate . for a start , netanyahu will try to improve his record on domestic and social issues by introducing more proactive policies tied to housing and land reform . the issue of housing requires especially painful economic and bureaucratic changes over the israel land authority and planning and zoning processes . but to address these issues properly , netanyahu will have to confront land owners and the housing constructors , meaning key structural reforms are unlikely in the short term . in addition , netanyahu will also have to repair the fractured relationship with washington , something that may not be easy given that ties with the obama administration will largely depends on whether a nuclear deal over iran is reached , and what shape such a deal takes . that raises the question over what direction the government will take over national security , and on this , the government can probably be expected to pursue the status quo . this is despite the fact that growing instability and the proliferation of __non-state__ hostile actors suggests that israel should instead move beyond a short-term approach and toward building a long-term , comprehensive national security strategy that could make it an integrated regional power . making such a change would require a political process capable of resolving the israeli-palestinian conflict , rather than merely kicking the can down the road . restarting communication with the west bank leadership and properly engaging with the arab peace initiative would be steps in the right direction . all that said , this will be netanyahu 's fourth term in office , and so there is plenty of evidence with which to judge his likely trajectory . and that suggests that he will find it easier to focus on issues tied to the economy than making any real steps forward on building a comprehensive __long-tern__ national security strategy . those hoping that the prime minister might rethink his national security policies are likely to be disappointed again .

ARTICEL:     washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- ted cruz is back in his favorite place : the spotlight . as the first candidate to quit the charade of `` exploring '' a presidential run and actually jumping in , the texas republican senator presented an image monday of __decisiveness__ and vision -- all before an auditorium of mostly supportive young evangelicals . now comes the hard part . cruz must make inroads with wide swaths of the gop if he hopes to break through as a top-tier candidate . he does n't have many friends in the party establishment thanks to his hard-line tactics on issues like obamacare . and he 's facing steep competition for the conservative vote from the likes of wisconsin gov. scott walker . even evangelicals , cruz 's target audience during his launch speech at liberty university , are n't firmly in his column . the firebrand 's decision to jump-start the 2016 election season now is an implicit admission of the daunting challenges he will face in a crowded gop field where multiple republicans will vie for the same social and evangelical support base . `` ted is clearly a player , '' said tony perkins , president of the family research council , a christian public policy ministry . `` but the competition this cycle is very steep . '' by choosing liberty university in virginia , which was founded by fundamentalist preacher jerry __falwell__ , to roll out his long shot campaign , cruz made clear he wo n't cede the christian right to another candidate . `` from the dawn of this country , at every stage , america has enjoyed god 's __providential__ blessing , '' said cruz , roaming the stage with a microphone like a megachurch preacher on a sunday morning . `` over and over again , when we faced impossible odds , the american people rose to the challenge . you know , compared to that , repealing obamacare and abolishing the irs ai n't all that tough . '' liberty offered cruz a ready-made crowd : young evangelicals in a vast auditorium who had little choice but to pack the stands , because the announcement came during their compulsory weekly __convocation__ . this is exactly the kind of coalition of youthful christian __idealists__ cruz must win over and get to work in early voting states if his presidential hopes are to catch fire . but cruz wo n't have this political territory all to himself . several students sat in the audience within view of the cameras wearing red t-shirts emblazoned with `` rand , '' referring to kentucky sen. rand paul , who is also likely to make a play for young conservatives . meanwhile , walker , with his governing record and history of facing down a recall and trade unions , seems to have eclipsed cruz in the minds of many conservatives who are desperate to take back the white house . `` when the grass roots look at a guy like scott walker -- he can not only bridge the divide , we believe , in the republican party , but he might be the one who can bridge the divide like he did in wisconsin , '' said jennifer stefano , a pennsylvania tea party activist . `` that 's what i think is dominating ted cruz -- he has not made as many headlines as in 2013 , as when he tried to stop and defund obamacare . '' cruz must also face off against paul , former arkansas gov. mike huckabee , former pennsylvania sen. rick santorum and dr. ben carson to win evangelicals -- a tough task . `` it 's a crowded field to begin with and it 's almost as if , within the republican contest , there are some early __sub-primaries__ : who is going to be the establishment candidate ? who is going to be the social conservative candidate ? '' said david __yepsen__ , who was for years the dean of iowa caucus reporters from his perch at the des moines register . meanwhile , a cnn/orc international poll last week put cruz as the choice of 4 % of likely republican voters . so if he seems unlikely to win , why would cruz get in -- and so early ? __paradoxically__ , the size of the task facing cruz and the tempered expectations for his bid may also mean that the risks that often weigh against a presidential candidacy -- the potential damage to a political career that can be caused by a poorly run campaign -- may not apply . perkins said he had been assured by cruz personally that he believes he can create a path to the nomination -- and ultimately the presidency -- despite the fact that he would be taking aim at the white house with the almost unanimous disapproval of the republican establishment . announcing now could give cruz more time to test messages beyond those tailored for evangelicals . he used his speech monday to also slam common core education standards and immigration reform , areas where establishment gop favorite jeb bush is perceived to be vulnerable . he also joined the hawkish republican barrage on foreign policy , slamming president barack obama over his row with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his record on iran and combating `` radical islamic terrorism . '' but should he fall short in his 2016 bid , a successful campaign that positions cruz as the leader of the evangelical right would certainly boost his political brand and position him for a future presidential run . and at only age 44 , there 's plenty of time for that . his texas senate seat , meanwhile , seems to be his as long as he wants it . he does n't have to run for re-election until 2018 , so a presidential bid would n't get in the way of the day job . so in a sense , cruz may not have that much to lose . another reason to get in early is iowa . the state is going to be crucial for cruz 's hopes because it is the most fertile early voting territory for his chosen campaign path . a win in the __first-in-the-nation__ caucus could crown cruz as the undisputed champion of the social and evangelical conservative wing of the party . but he is going to be facing proven iowa campaigners . huckabee won the state in 2008 and santorum won a recount over the eventual gop nominee , mitt romney , in 2012 . both have substantial networks of support and , crucially , know many caucus voters personally in a state where the personal touch counts for everything . `` i think cruz has generated some excitement in iowa , and he is a new face , '' said __yepsen__ . `` but it is going to be a while before he closes the sale with a lot of activists . '' an added bonus for cruz getting in now : the early bird gets the best coverage . in a matter of weeks , republican presidential announcements from the massive gop field will draw little more than a shrug , so getting out ahead of expected announcements from paul and florida sen. marco rubio could be a good idea . when democrat hillary clinton makes her official plunge into the 2016 race , any republican candidate may struggle to dominate media coverage for several weeks . monday also happened to be the fifth anniversary of the day obamacare was signed into law . because cruz has spent endless hours trying to overturn it -- winning the appreciation of conservative activists in the process -- monday was a good moment to highlight the point . then there is money . cruz , unlike some other potential republican candidates , may have to work extra hard to raise the campaign funds he needs to mount a viable campaign . his early announcement gives him time for a __post-announcement__ spurt before the next quarterly fundraising figures close at the end of the month , and a full three months to put up an impressive number in the next quarter .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     ted cruz 's decision to jump-start the 2016 election season is an implicit admission of the challenges he faces . cruz will fight a bevy of other candidates for the votes of the christian right .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- during a conversation with a professor at an ivy league college , a mother __nudges__ her daughter to share how she 's president of her school 's `` __survivors-of-bulimia__ '' group . hoping to impress the yale admissions committee , a student writes an essay about the time she was so engrossed in a discussion with a french teacher she admired that she urinated on herself instead of interrupting the teacher or leaving the room . looking to give their child an edge , parents hire a college admissions consultant when their child is in the eighth grade and know the total tab will be roughly $ 50,000 . how i wish i could report that those three nuggets were pure fiction , __morsels__ from my imagination for a great storyline for a novel or television series . but sadly , they are __all-too-real__ examples included in a provocative new book `` where you go is not who you 'll be : an antidote to the college admissions mania '' by award-winning new york times op-ed columnist and bestselling author frank bruni . those examples , bruni said , should really be `` wake-up calls '' for any parents or students currently engaged in , or one day likely to be consumed by , the `` what school will i get into ? '' annual game . `` this says that we are attaching a level of importance to this that is just completely bonkers , '' bruni said during a recent interview . student goes 8 for 8 in ivy league college admissions . for many families in the united states , the challenge is n't getting into the right college . it is being able to afford the school of their choice , or any school for that matter . but for many middle - and __upper-income__ families , the college admissions process is as frenzied as ever with the belief that one school can make or break a child 's future . i had to ask bruni , whom i met during my time covering presidential politics , how exactly college admissions became so insanely intense and ridiculously competitive . we both laughed that the process was definitely not nearly as manic or as charged when we both went to college in the '80s . bruni points to a number of factors all mixed together , creating `` this kind of perfect storm of just absolute fixation , panic , etc. '' about where kids are going to go to school , whether it 's exclusive enough and whether they 've `` breached the inner sanctum . '' there 's the economic pessimism over the past decade , combined with a widening chasm between the haves and __have-nots__ , he said . `` i think all of that has made parents feel anxious on behalf of their kids and has made them feel like their kids have to have anything that might be a leg up , and if an elite school is a leg up , well , then __dammit__ , let 's get them that . '' adding to the dangerous brew , says bruni , is the `` whole test prep and college coaching industry . '' yes , it has become an industry , with parents and students willing to pay thousands of dollars to consultants for an extra edge . that `` industry '' did n't exist just three decades ago when frank and i were applying . 5 ways community colleges are fixing higher education . the final piece of the puzzle are the colleges , which have essentially become businesses , marketing themselves and using their acceptance rate as a bragging right . `` so when you have colleges drumming up extra applications so that they can then claim an acceptance rate below 15 % , that becomes part of the discussion that adds to the anxiety because you look at these numbers and you think , ` oh my god , if i do n't begin doing sat prep as a freshman in high school , if i do n't hire the private tutor , ' '' i wo n't get in -- or so the thinking goes , said bruni . but how much does where you go really determine how successful you will ultimately be ? consider the fortune 500 and the alma __maters__ of the heads of the 10 companies with the highest gross revenues back in the summer of 2014 . there was only one ivy league school on the list -lrb- dartmouth -rrb- , bruni says in his book . when you look at the fortune 500 executives in the top 30 , you see cornell , princeton and brown , but also the university of central oklahoma , the university of pittsburgh and the university of minnesota , he writes . the point is there is n't one exact path to the corner office , and an ivy league degree or a degree from another prestigious private university is neither a requirement nor a guarantee . national politics is another case in point . sure , there are presidents who hail from the __ivies__ -lrb- george w. bush , bill clinton -rrb- but there are many who do n't : ronald reagan went to eureka college , a small school in illinois , and richard nixon got his undergraduate degree from __whittier__ college in southern california . looking at other national politicians who either ran for or could run for president someday , new jersey gov. chris christie and vice president joe biden graduated from the university of delaware , paul ryan from miami university of ohio and john edwards from north carolina state university . bruni said a big reason for writing the book was that when he surveyed the accomplished people he has known and interviewed , there did n't seem to be any `` exaggerated concentration '' of people coming from the most selective colleges . `` so the amount of importance that parents and kids seem to be attaching to the __selectiveness__ of where they went to school did not seem to me to jibe at all with the ingredients of success as manifest in the people i 've met who were successful and even more to the point content , '' he said . `` and so i felt like that contradiction really needed to be pointed out in a bold way . '' part of what fuels the perception that the most successful among us always attend the most selective schools is what we see and read about people who 've made it . for instance , take the `` 30 under 30 '' list , which forbes magazine puts out every year . bruni writes about how back in 2013 , a website called the __60second__ recap noted how every time honorees attended a school like harvard , stanford or princeton , it was mentioned in the profile . but if they had n't graduated from such a school , forbes did n't mention their alma mater . `` so why do we get the impression that so many of the world 's most glittering people went to these schools ? because when they 've gone to those schools , we make it part of their biography because we think it explains something . and when they have n't gone to those schools , we skip right over it because we think it 's actually contradictory evidence when it may be anything but . '' one of the most poignant stories that bruni shares in his book is the letter matt levin 's parents wrote to him the night before he received his first college response . levin , like many of his classmates at cold spring harbor high school on long island , had ivy on his mind . he hoped for admission to yale , princeton or brown , and he did everything to be a standout candidate : studying with a tutor for the __sats__ , playing on the varsity baseball team , earning one of the highest grade point averages as a junior and volunteering for more than 100 hours of community service . the letters came , and levin got rejected by all three . his mom and dad , in their letter , wrote , `` your worth as a person , a student and our son is not diminished or influenced in the least by what these colleges have decided . if it does not go your way , you 'll take a different route to get where you want . '' a letter to my son as he leaves for college . `` what i love about matt levin 's parents and that story is ... they were saying , we know you 've been filled with these aspirations . we may have been agents of filling you with them , '' said bruni . `` what they were saying is this is one metric in a life with many of them . do not turn this metric into a __bludgeon__ that you are beating yourself up with , and that 's what i think parents need to do . '' is it possible to restore any sanity to the entire college admissions process ? bruni said what we can do is try to change the conversation and begin to also talk about the negative consequences of this push to get into the most selective school . `` if we give kids too much of an impression that the name on their diploma is going to be everything , we run the risk of also telling them that their diploma is going to do the work for them . '' kids who feel that way often end up in therapy or completely incapable of carving out a life , he said . `` if we talk about all the things that happen , all the negative things that attend an __over-concentration__ on getting into an elite school , then maybe we will begin to not concentrate as much on getting into elite schools . '' bruni hopes parents and students read his book , but he especially hopes graduating seniors read it before they head off to school . because while we spend so much time worrying about where our kids are going to get in , we spend less time on what they are going to do and explore when they get there . `` so my dream audience are kids going off to college , and kids who are going off to college ... being made to think about more than the name on their sweatshirt and being made to ponder what they 're going to do with this extraordinary privilege . '' do you think going to an elite college gives you a leg up when it comes to professional success ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter or cnn living on facebook .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- a __gloved__ hand reaches for a scantily-clad backside . it could be an image from the hit television series `` mad men , '' which documented the __ribald__ world of advertising in 1960s america . except this is 2015 and `` who squeezes them in __harelbeke__ ? '' is the poster __strapline__ for the elite e3 __harelbeke__ competition in belgium , accompanied by that __gloved__ cyclist 's hand poised to pinch a woman 's bottom . unlike the wind provocatively lifting up her skirt , the controversial advertisement was n't dreamed up out of thin air . it 's inspired by previous winner slovak peter sagan , who pinched a podium girl 's behind at the 2013 tour de flanders -- something he later apologized for , saying `` i promise to act more respectfully in the future . '' a week earlier , he was also pictured on the e3 __harelbeke__ podium , making an __ass-grabbing__ motion towards another flower girl . e3 __harelbeke__ 's organizers chose to celebrate his antics in their 2015 campaign , sparking a global debate about sexism in cycling that has raced far beyond the billboard . `` old boy 's club '' `` a guy grabbing a woman 's ass is very much indicative of a level of sexual assault , '' said kathryn __bertine__ , former professional cyclist and director of `` half the road , '' a documentary about female racers . `` this poster makes cycling look very outdated . they 're relying on a ` good old boys club ' tactic to help them sell a product -- and in this case that product is racing . '' judging by e3 __harelebeke__ 's provocative standards , the poster could even appear tame compared to previous years . in 2011 organizers opted for a naked woman lying in a field , while the silhouettes of miniature riders traversed her bare backside . more baffling was last year 's poster featuring a woman straddling three other females curled into the shape of a bike . `` such provocative imagery may have been seen by some in the 1950s and 1960s as a basis for selling products , but marketing communications are a rather more sophisticated and progressive activity than they were 50 years ago , '' said simon chadwick , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at coventry university . `` i think e3 __harelbeke__ are rather out of __kilter__ with the way that most people think today . '' `` a playful nod '' cycling 's world governing body , the union __cycliste__ __internationale__ -lrb- uci -rrb- has since requested the poster be removed , to which the e3 __harelbeke__ organisers have agreed -- not that they necessarily see it as offensive themselves . `` personally , no i do n't think it 's sexist , '' marc __claerhout__ , e3 __harelebeke__ manager , told cnn . could he see why others might find it offensive ? `` i do n't know . you have a lot of publicity where you see more than some underwear , '' he said . `` and we did n't mean it as sexist . '' the organization has since withdrawn the poster , releasing an official apology to `` anyone who might find it intimidating , discriminatory or sexist . '' `` the organization launched this campaign as a playful nod to the stage incident two years ago in which a rider got ready to squeeze the buttocks of a flower girl , '' it added . removing the poster is one thing -- but the uci missed an opportunity to make an example of a tournament which has used seemingly sexist campaigns for years , said olympic road race champion , nicole cooke . `` telling the race organizers to remove the posters is not much of a deterrent , '' added the retired cyclist whose autobiography `` the breakaway '' highlighted sexism within the sport during her over decade long career . `` a whopping fine and canceling the race would have sent out the strong message that there is no place for sexism in cycling . instead , the race has received huge publicity . '' celebrating sexual assault ? the poster also __glorifies__ what would be seen as sexual assault in any other workplace , said laura bates , founder of the `` everyday sexism project . '' `` it contains a direct reference to an incident of sexual assault , which should n't be treated as something to celebrate and joke about , '' she added . similarly , belgium 's institute for the equality between men and women , said the image violated 2007 anti-discrimination legislation and `` incited sexual intimidation . '' it 's unlikely the same image would have been used in a female tournament . `` not only is the poster sexist -- this race does n't even have a women 's field , '' said __bertine__ , who has long campaigned for a women 's edition of the tour de france equal to the men 's -- a race often seen as the ultimate prize in cycling . `` here we are , fighting these battles to make equality happen . and posters like this are not helping to pave the way for cycling , '' she said . she sees the problem not with the majority of `` supportive '' male cyclists , but with the lack of female representation among race directors and promoters . money talks . indeed , sponsorship is a big factor is getting a race like the women 's tour de france off the ground , said alex russell , one of two females on the board of british cycling . `` a lot of it comes down to whether something has a market value -- and it 's not necessarily down to gender , '' she said . `` we 've introduced a women 's tour in britain and we have got financial support for that . but you ca n't just jump to mass spectators and mass broadcasting because these things grow __incrementally__ . '' former world road race champion cooke points to the discrepancy in prize money as another big obstacle for women within the sport . `` the inspiration for the poster is the 2013 tour de flanders , for which male winner fabian cancellara received $ 20,000 -lrb- $ 22,000 -rrb- for his efforts . in comparison , when i won this event , i was happy for the team to split the modest $ 1,000 i received amongst the other riders , '' she said . `` the biggest change i would recommend to provide protection , security and credibility for female road riders , would be the introduction of a minimum wage , as there is in place for male riders , '' added cooke . `` cycling can not be allowed to exist outside the laws of society , like some sort of medieval anarchy . '' it seems that rather than a podium girl 's bottom , the one being put under the spotlight at this year 's event , will be the organizers themselves .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- isis ' recent video showing a child shooting a man whom the extremist group claimed was an israeli spy is the latest example of how the militants exploit children in their propaganda . as isis encourages foreign fighters to bring their families into the parts of syria and iraq where it imposes its brutal rule , the catalog of children taking part in shocking acts is grim and growing . the deeply disturbing cases shine a light into the range of ways the militants are using children to further their aims . in august , an australian man who had taken his young family to join isis in syria posted a photo on twitter of his 7-year-old son using both hands to hold up a man 's severed head . `` that 's my boy , '' the father wrote alongside the photo , which was reportedly taken in isis ' syrian stronghold of raqqa . in a video the jihadist group released in january , a boy with long hair wearing a black sweater and military fatigue pants appears to shoot two men in the back of the head . the boy then stands over one of the bodies , fires two more times , and later raises his pistol in the air . last month , when isis publicized its __immolation__ of the captive jordanian fighter pilot lt. __moath__ al-kasasbeh , one of its videos showed a young boy watching a public screening of the killing in raqqa and saying that he would `` burn the pilot '' himself if he had the chance . those examples reflect a broader effort to __induct__ children into isis ' campaign of violence . isis has also promoted videos of young boys training as fighters , some of them wearing the militants ' black masks , holding bullets and waving the group 's flags . the jihadist movement has called the boys the `` cubs of the caliphate , '' a reference to the way isis fighters refer to one another as `` lions . '' it has taken over schools with the purpose of __indoctrinating__ children . human rights watch has said that isis and other extremist groups `` have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks , including suicide bombing missions . '' the united nations has said there are confirmed reports of children as young as 12 undergoing military training . one 15-year-old boy told cnn in november how he was regularly strapped into an explosive vest and handed a pistol , an ak-47 and a radio to stand guard at an isis base in syria . another boy told cnn last year that isis forced his father to send him to one of its children 's camps in northern syria when he was just 13 . `` for 30 days we woke up and jogged , had breakfast , then learned the quran and the __hadith__ of the prophet . then we took courses on weapons , kalashnikovs and other light military stuff , '' said the boy , who later fled to turkey with his family . some of the militants at the camp were kind , joking and laughing with the younger recruits , he recalled . others made the boys watch hideous things . `` they used to bring young -lsb- kids -rsb- to the camp to lash them , '' said the boy , whose real name was withheld because of fears for his safety . `` when we go to the mosque , they order us to come the next day at a specific time and place to -lsb- watch -rsb- heads cut off , lashings or __stonings__ . '' `` we saw a young man who did not fast for ramadan , so they crucified him for three days , and we saw a woman being stoned -lsb- to death -rsb- because she committed adultery , '' he said . syrian activists say that some of the boys indoctrinated and trained at such camps are now being killed on the front lines of battle . cnn is unable to independently verify those claims . the militant group , also known as isil and the islamic state , is aggressively using social media to try to lure more young people to join its ranks . the decision of three british teenage girls to travel to syria last month was a stark example of isis ' ability to attract young westerners . another young british woman who left scotland to join isis in 2013 now appears to write a blog about her life under the extremists ' rule , describing perks and offering reassurances to those who might follow in her footsteps . western officials , though , say that isis is pushing a false narrative of what things are really like in its territory . but officials also admit they 're struggling to counter the relentless wave of propaganda churned out on social media by isis members and supporters . `` there 's no question what we 're combating with isil 's propaganda machine is something we have not seen before , '' u.s. state department spokeswoman jen psaki told cnn last month .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- for the second time in his career , madison , wisconsin , police officer matt kenny is being investigated for using lethal force . but the cases and their circumstances are different , very different . friday 's death of tony robinson , an unarmed biracial 19-year-old , has made madison the latest epicenter of protests of black males killed by white officers . eight years ago , it was a different story . kenny shot and killed a man who pointed a pellet gun at him . he was exonerated of any wrongdoing and received a commendation . the dead man was white . it started as a 911 call . the caller reported a man with a gun on his front porch . what the dispatcher did n't know was the man that ronald brandon was talking about was himself . three officers rushed to the scene , including kenny . they knew they were facing a potentially life-threatening situation . they were unaware that brandon 's ex-wife , susan , was also calling 911 . `` my ex-husband is sitting outside and i think he just called 911 , '' she said . `` he 's got a pellet gun ... he 's drunk . '' as she talked to the dispatcher , the squad cars arrived outside . `` i think he called you because he wants to end his drunkenness , '' brandon said . `` i hear the sirens coming . jesus __criminy__ . it 's not a real gun . i think he wants to be taken away . '' the officers never learned that the weapon ronald brandon pointed at them was a pellet gun . the call with that information came 40 seconds before they arrived . kenny shot him dead . investigators ruled the shooting a `` suicide by cop . '' for his handling of the incident , kenny was awarded the medal of valor , the department 's highest honor . last week 's shooting has n't earned __commendations__ . it 's polarized a community . because robinson did not have a weapon , his death spurred memories of other unarmed black men killed by police : michael brown in ferguson , missouri . eric garner in staten island , new york . over the weekend , protesters filled streets in madison . on monday , demonstrators packed the wisconsin state capitol . they chanted and carried a banner with a familiar message : `` black lives matter . '' the incident started friday night when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars , madison police chief mike __koval__ said . when kenny went to the apartment where the report came from , he heard some commotion and forced his way in , __koval__ said . `` once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer , '' __koval__ said . after that , according to the chief , `` the officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject . '' kenny has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation . `` it 's a stressful period for him and his family , but he also understands that a family here has suffered a tragic loss and he understands that there has to be an investigation , '' said james palmer , executive director of the wisconsin professional police association . under wisconsin law , __officer-involved__ shootings are investigated by an outside agency , in this case the division of criminal investigation . once the division completes its investigation , the report will go to the local district attorney , __koval__ said . palmer declined to comment on the ongoing investigation , but said there are some circumstances when an unarmed person could still be seen as posing a deadly threat to a police officer . `` the real fear for any officer when he 's being attacked , generally speaking , is that their weapon will be taken away , '' palmer said , `` and an unarmed individual can become armed very quickly . '' concern is a word often used by the police chief as the investigation continues . concern for his officer . concern for the community . kenny , 45 , is a 12-year veteran of the madison police department . __koval__ calls him `` a very conscientious dedicated public servant , '' but acknowledges that a second shooting in eight-year 's time is , well , concerning . `` any loss of life is very tragic , '' the chief said . `` twice is concerning for anyone . we are concerned for him and the community .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- early intervention changes lives . respite care keeps families together . both save states money over time . alas , both -- along with a huge swathe of other vital services -- are under attack by the administration of bruce __rauner__ , the new republican governor of illinois . this is happening for two reasons . first , __rauner__ has a problem . he promised to lower taxes despite a $ 6.2 billion structural budget deficit . unwilling to think about new revenue , all he can do is cut programs . second , __rauner__ 's cuts are taking place against the backdrop of a bigger attack on disability . too many right-wing politicians and pundits see disability as a wedge issue with which they can divide interest groups , pit people who need help against each other and rip apart the core social safety net . meanwhile , they reassure their base , which is filled with individuals who also need help from the state , that only they really deserve benefits . like __rauner__ , other governors are cutting services in the name of austerity . kansas , under sam brownback , has pushed disabled people off medicaid , making services less effective and efficient . scott walker , in wisconsin , has proposed cutting long-term care services in such a way as to limit individual choice of caregivers and service providers , empowering the healthcare industry and not disabled americans . florida has gutted benefits to severely disabled individuals in workers ' compensation cases and eliminated countless positions in the department of health . and that 's all just at the state level . nationally , the new congress began the year with a sustained attack on social security disability insurance , which some analysts see as a way to threaten the whole foundation of social security . last december , house republicans insisted that the able act , a bill intended to help people with disabilities and their caregivers save money , only be offered to those who were disabled before the age of 26 , a limitation aimed at excluding people who become disabled through work , disease , accident or age . now bruce __rauner__ is adding to this troubling pattern . the __rauner__ budget slashes state spending by over $ 4 billion , much of the savings gleaned by eliminating or reducing eligibility for programs based in the department of human services -lrb- dhs -rrb- . each cut will come with costs to families and individuals who need the state 's help most . moreover , many of the cut programs actually save the state money over time . take , for example , early intervention , which provides services to children with developmental delays from birth to age 3 at little cost to the parents -lrb- there are __means-tested__ __co-pays__ -rrb- . at their best , these therapies not only help children with disabilities learn new skills , but also teach parents to better understand their children . right now , a child who is at least 30 % delayed in any category -- for example being at least 30 % less able to use speech than a typical child of their age -- is eligible for services . now , as explained to me by a spokesperson for dhs , the program has to save $ 23 million -lrb- they did not explain how this number was picked -rrb- . the plan is to take every child who is __30-49__ % delayed -lrb- about 10,000 children -rrb- , __re-test__ them , and remove eligibility from thousands of those deemed the least deserving until the arbitrary dollar amount is reached . over the long term , this is not only bad for children , but is bad for illinois ' budget . the program is extremely economically efficient . for each dollar spent on programs like early intervention , according to studies by people such as the nobel laureate james __heckman__ and the rand corporation , the state saves at least $ 7 in future services . those savings are , in fact , most likely to be realized most dramatically with precisely the children that dhs is trying to exclude . children with only mild delays can , with early intervention , avoid requiring the more expensive special education services in school when they are older . everyone wins . despite this gregory __bassi__ , acting secretary of dhs , is undeterred . at a recent state senate budget hearing , which i attended , __bassi__ kept saying that the program was too expensive and seemed unable to address the long-term costs of short-term savings . he even , in a revealing moment , said that his own nephew ought to get booted from the program because the nephew 's parents make too much money -lrb- a spokesperson clarified that __bassi__ actually has two nephews in the program , both of whom have benefited from the therapy -rrb- . respite programs , which the __rauner__ budget eliminates entirely , provide qualified assistance to people who care for people with disabilities . sometimes , such a program just enables the caregiver to do errands or have some private time , essential to maintaining one 's ability to function in a challenging home environment . the programs also provide emergency backup should the caregiver have a medical problem or some other issue . like early intervention , the program is cost efficient . without respite , families are more likely to disintegrate . in such cases , the person with a disability is likely to end up in a state-run facility . this is both vastly more expensive and , most importantly , generally bad for the institutionalized individual . in fact , the __rauner__ budget is packed with what illinois senate appropriations committee chair heather __steans__ , a democrat , called , `` penny wise , pound foolish '' proposals . throughout , the governor and his administration have found ways to __re-write__ definitions of disability in order to save money . they will likely end up paying more as a result of increased use of emergency rooms , rates of incarceration and homelessness . violent encounters between police and people with disabilities will only become more common . people who now receive aid that allows them to live more independently will end up institutionalized or in nursing homes . not only that , but many of these programs bring in matching funds from the federal government or other sources , and the state is surrendering those dollars as well . so why make these cuts , given their likely long-term costs ? it may be that the __rauner__ administration just does n't care about long-term fiscal health so long as next year 's budget looks good . but i see the __rauner__ attacks on __disability-related__ services as just the latest example of lawmakers trying to __re-define__ disability in a way that saves them money . questions about the fundamental necessity of disability benefits infuse right-wing speech on the issue . thom tillis , the new senator from north carolina , was filmed in 2011 calling republicans to `` divide and conquer '' by separating the sympathetic disabled -- people with conditions like down syndrome and cerebral palsy -- from the unsympathetic -lrb- people he implies are just lazy -rrb- . that 's a rhetoric i see at play regularly , though most lawmakers are too smart to say it out loud . recently , for example , sen. rand paul of kentucky falsely claimed that 50 % of all individuals on disability were `` gaming the system .

ARTICEL:     washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- democrats who have gleefully watched republican infighting for years are about to feel some heat of their own . as the party works to retake control of the senate in 2016 , democrats are looking at a senate landscape that could feature titanic __intraparty__ clashes starring big personalities who have been waiting years for a shot at the big time . it 's a big shift from recent years when republicans , riven by long-standing ideological fault lines , faced divisive and __attention-grabbing__ primaries , usually pitting a party favorite against insurgents from the conservative grassroots . memorably , in 2010 and 2012 , the fights were so damaging that republicans failed to pick up __winnable__ senate seats by nominating __flagrantly__ unprepared candidates . democrats , for the most part , have not had to face the same problem . but that might be changing . while the fields of candidates are still taking shape , a platoon of democrats are mulling senate bids in ohio , florida , maryland , california , pennsylvania and illinois . while many of them have yet to formally declare campaigns , none possess the kind of __field-clearing__ star power that could help democrats avoid a primary bonanza , and few show signs of putting their ambitions aside for the sake of party unity . republican primary battles are n't going anywhere in 2016 , and on the presidential level , democrats continue to line up behind hillary clinton as their nominee , without a whiff a serious primary challenge . but there is a different story unfolding in the next race for the senate , where the question is whether democrats will __cleave__ along ideological and generational lines in primary fights , jeopardizing the party 's hopes of regaining control of the the upper chamber . `` the great irony of democrats celebrating fissures amongst republicans in recent years is that historically they 're much less capable of confronting the extreme elements within their party than the gop , '' said josh holmes , a former top strategist to republican senate leader mitch mcconnell . `` now we 're watching several years of pent-up liberal aggression about to spill into divisive primaries that will undoubtedly complicate things considerably for their senate chances . '' democrats scoff at the idea , claiming that no potential candidate has the ability to fumble away a senate win against the many republicans up for re-election next year . of the nine senate seats rated as __toss-up__ or competitive the rothenberg & gonzales political report , seven of them are held by republicans elected in the tea party wave of 2010 . democrats need a net gain of five seats to take back the senate . `` unfortunately for the numerous vulnerable republican senators , there are no todd __akins__ here , and there is n't a single state on the map with a democratic primary that will negatively impact our ability win the state , '' said justin __barasky__ , the democratic senatorial campaign committee 's communications director . akin , of course , was the gop nominee in missouri in 2012 who derailed his own campaign with a comment about `` legitimate rape . '' last cycle , __barasky__ said , democrats witnessed hotly contested senate primaries in new jersey , massachusetts and hawaii . all of those fights were in blue states , of course . but none of them resulted in a november loss for democrats . republicans , though , are hoping to breathe life into the narrative , especially with democratic primaries brewing in the competitive states of florida and ohio . `` democrats are facing messy primaries in key senate races across the country , and there does n't seem to be any end in sight , '' said andrea __bozek__ , communications director for the national republican senatorial committee . `` the infighting is so bad that it 's not just limited to candidates in key races , but is even playing out between harry reid and the __dscc__ in washington . '' the most crowded lane , for now , appears to be in maryland , where __five-term__ sen. barbara mikulski is retiring . in a state that reliably goes blue in federal elections , the retirement has at long last opened a door for a raft of democrats in congress eyeing higher office . with the exception of house democratic whip steny hoyer , nearly every democrat in maryland 's __eight-member__ congressional delegation has signaled some kind of interest in the senate seat . naacp president benjamin jealous and baltimore mayor stephanie __rawlings-blake__ have also been floated as contenders . despite the microscopic ideological differences between the likely candidates , the race has already been heralded as a battle between the party 's __play-it-safe__ establishment and its restive liberal wing . harry reid , the democratic leader in the senate , declined to stay neutral and promptly endorsed rep. chris van hollen for the seat , a sign that the national party apparatus might be in his corner . the __dscc__ , however , has not picked a side in the race . progressive groups , meanwhile , have championed a known figure from their community : rep. donna edwards , who joined the race last week vowing to protect social security and medicare , `` no ifs __ands__ __buts__ or __willing-to-considers__ . '' that was seen as a poke at van hollen , who said in 2012 he was `` willing to consider '' entitlement changes as part of deficit negotiations . but even if the primary turns into a pitched battle over progressive priorities , there is little chance the nomination fight would hinder democratic hopes in maryland , which has n't seen a gop senator since charles mathias in 1987 . and mathias , a civil rights advocate and __skeptic__ of ronald reagan , was one of the most liberal members of the republican party . republicans are also hoping for democratic carnage in ohio , where sen. rob portman is up for re-election . national democrats have endorsed former gov. ted strickland for the nomination , but the news did not force __p.g.__ __sittenfeld__ , an up-and-coming 30-year-old cincinnati city councilman , out of the race . democrats are skeptical that __sittenfeld__ can raise the kind of money to compete against strickland and portman , but if he does , his candidacy will make for a stark contrast against the __73-year__ old strickland . in an interview , __sittenfeld__ spoke critically of portman , calling him `` a 25-year creature of washington '' who is `` out of touch '' with ohio . but the next-generation rhetoric could also stir inevitable questions about strickland 's age . `` i fit the mold for new leadership , '' __sittenfeld__ told cnn in an interview , careful to note his admiration for strickland and stressing that he is running against portman . `` if you put together 100 people into the senate , would n't you want at least one person from the largest generation in american history , the most technologically savvy generation in american history ? '' __sittenfeld__ asked . `` how can we invest in technology and innovation to solve problems when we are __rehashing__ stale battles ? '' as in maryland , there appear to be no major early-stage differences between strickland and __sittenfeld__ on the issues , which again suggests that the democratic primary boom of 2016 is more about timing and opportunity than anything else . with a presidential election on the ballot , increased voter turnout is expected to give democrats a lift in the general election . `` there is an ideological reason for running , but let 's not separate that from a path to victory , '' said nathan gonzales , editor of the gonzales & rothenberg report . `` primaries happen when multiple candidates see a good opportunity . democrats have good opportunities in multiple states this cycle , specifically in maryland . the democratic nomination is incredibly valuable because maryland is a democratic state . lots of candidates see paths to victory and think , ` why not me ? why not now ? ' '' and while primaries can drain financial resources and drive uncomfortable headlines , the contests are not necessarily damaging , gonzales said . `` crowded and expensive primaries do not prohibit general election victory , '' he said . `` that does n't mean that a party ca n't win . '' brad todd , a republican consultant who worked on several top tier senate races in 2014 , said the primaries might boost democrats . `` some of those primaries will __animate__ elements of their base , including some donors , more than the general elections , '' he said . but todd said the rush of primary activity for democrats does not compare to the pitched tea __party-versus-establishment__ battles that have roiled his party for years . `` i do n't see that happening with democrats as much as it does with republicans since all of their candidates are pretty much orthodox liberals , '' he said . `` there 's no such thing as a centrist democrat anymore , so there wo n't be nearly as many __sabers__ to rattle against them in primaries . ''

ARTICEL:     washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- during his upcoming speech to congress , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu will lay out the details of what he understands to be the nuclear agreement between world powers and iran , hoping it will prompt lawmakers to question the administration and delay the march 24 deadline for a political agreement . a senior israeli official traveling in netanyahu 's delegation , who was not authorized to speak on the record , said the israeli government had `` a good understanding of the agreement we can draw conclusions from . '' `` we know what we know . and believe me , we know a lot of information about this agreement , '' the official told reporters aboard the flight to washington . `` the prime minister is going to congress to explain what they do n't know about this agreement that it is a bad agreement . '' will speech backfire ? the official said congress has `` no understanding '' of the deal shaping up . he described the prime minister 's speech as a `` last chance '' to speak directly to congress before a march 24 deadline for a political framework agreement about the elements believed to be in the deal . the official would not disclose how the israeli government reportedly had more information on the deal than the u.s. congress , but noted that many of the parties were leaking details of the talks . however , in congressional testimony before a senate appropriations subcommittee last week , secretary of state john kerry said , `` anybody running around right now jumping in to say , ` well , we do n't like the deal ' or this or that , does n't know what the deal is . there is no deal yet . and i caution people to wait and see what these negotiations produce . '' the official suggested netanyahu would urge lawmakers in his tuesday address to pressure the obama administration to push the deadline so more discussion can take place about what he perceives is a dangerous deal that leaves iran with the ability to develop a nuclear weapon down the line . `` there is no sacred date , '' the official said of the march 24 deadline . `` it can be put off . it is not fixed . they can change it '' the official said that as the march 24 deadline approaches , netanyahu will warn `` be careful of giving up compromises . they are compromises and they are not good . '' obama hinted last week that he did not see the need for any additional extensions , saying the talks have , `` sufficiently narrowed and sufficiently clarified that we 're at the point where they need to make a decision . '' that deadline was agreed to by the five parties and iran , which is why kerry is having marathon meetings with the iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif in geneva beginning again this week . 6 questions about netanyahu 's visit . netanyahu spoke with kerry on the eve of his trip , the official said , adding that despite the fraught political tone of netanyahu 's visit , the united states and israel continue to communicate through intelligence channels . intelligence and national security officials , this official said , met last week with national security adviser susan rice and wendy sherman , the lead u.s. negotiator for the iran talks . `` the objective of israel is to get a better agreement , '' the official said . `` we want a good agreement . we are not against all agreements and the prime minister never said we were .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- italian fashion designer stefano gabbana and elton john are in a war of words on social media , calling for boycotts of each other 's work . the argument stems from comments about in-vitro fertilization in panorama magazine , in which gabbana and longtime collaborator domenico dolce spoke about `` synthetic '' children born from `` rented '' wombs . `` no chemical children : life has a natural course , there are things that should n't be modified , '' the magazine says in a quote attributed to both designers . the magazine also promises insights from the designers on `` the importance of relationships within conventional families with very , very traditional values '' in an interview that hit italian newsstands last week . john , who has two children with husband david furnish through ivf , issued a strong __repudiation__ of the statements on sunday and pledged to boycott the dolce & gabbana fashion line . in response , gabbana defended his `` freedom to speak '' and called on fans to boycott john . sir elton appears to be winning the social media war with the hashtag __#boycottdolcegabbana__ , which by monday morning had been used more than 35,000 times on twitter since john invoked it on sunday . by comparison , gabbana 's __#boycotteltonjohn__ has been used just 1,600 times on twitter , according to social media search tool __topsy__ . `` how dare you refer to my beautiful children as ` synthetic ' . and shame on you for wagging your __judgemental__ little fingers at ivf - a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people , both straight and gay , to fulfill their dream of having children , '' john said sunday on instagram . `` your archaic thinking is out of step with the times , just like your fashions . i shall never wear dolce and gabbana ever again . '' the sentiment quickly gathered support from such celebrities as ricky martin , al roker and courtney love . tennis star martina navratilova tweeted her support for john 's post , saying `` my __d&g__ shirts are going in the bin -- do n't want anyone to wear them . '' parents and ivf advocates also joined the boycott . `` my son is not synthetic . his life was made possible through __#ivf__ & i could n't be more grateful , '' writer and infertility advocate jenn palumbo said in a tweet . the comments from dolce and gabbana struck some as hypocritical coming from a couple that was romantically involved until 2005 -lrb- they continued working together after the breakup -rrb- . still , gabbana has dropped hints in interviews of his `` traditional '' views toward family structure . he told an italian publication in 2006 that he once asked a female friend to be a surrogate mother because he was `` opposed to the idea of a child growing up with two gay parents . '' gabbana was quick to react to this controversy , calling john a `` fascist '' in an instagram comment that was later deleted , according to cnn affiliate __tgcom24__ . he also sought to discredit reports that they told panorama in this instance they objected to same-sex adoption , even though gabbana took that position in his 2006 interview . by sunday evening , gabbana 's instagram feed was full of __screengrabs__ and __reposts__ from people who supported his right to voice his opinion . `` it 's a shame that you are not allowed to say what you like , '' one person said in a comment on gabbana 's instagram . `` you have every right to say what you want , especially as you were n't disrespectful nor immature like elton was . his comments are unnecessary , cheap and childish . '' gabbana issued a statement saying he and dolce had not intended to judge others . `` we firmly believe in democracy and the fundamental principle of freedom of expression that upholds it . we talked about our way of seeing reality , but it was never our intention to judge other people 's choices , '' the statement read . dolce also defended his views in statement and said he was not applying them to other people . `` i 'm sicilian and i grew up in a traditional family , made up of a mother , a father and children . i am very well aware of the fact that there are other types of families and they are as legitimate as the one i 've known . but in my personal experience , family had a different configuration ... i was talking about my personal view , without judging other people 's choices and decisions , '' the statement read . cnn 's alba __prifti__ contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- a black hawk helicopter that went down in waters off the florida panhandle three days ago -- killing 11 service members -- had aborted a training mission due to bad weather before it crashed , a military official said friday . on the same day that officials released the names of the seven marines who were aboard , new details emerged friday on the fatal mission at the santa rosa sound near __eglin__ air force base . as officials continue to investigate why the aircraft went down in thick fog tuesday , maj. gen. joseph l. __osterman__ -- commander of u.s. marine corps forces special operations command -lrb- __marsoc__ -rrb- -- told reporters that the black hawk was one of two that had to abort exercises involving water `` insertion and extraction techniques '' before the crash . `` my understanding is ... that they were flying as we normally do -- two aircraft together , '' __osterman__ said . `` as they went in , they encountered bad weather and made the decision to wave off and to abort the training mission . at that point , the one helicopter obviously made it back and determined that the second helicopter was not back with them in that return . '' the crash occurred at night -- hours after the two helicopters had successfully completed the same training exercise in daylight . the black hawk helicopters were training near __eglin__ as heavy fog shrouded the sound -- a narrow body of water between mainland northern florida and a barrier island -- about 8:30 p.m. tuesday , the military said . `` the fog was moving in and out , '' __osterman__ said . `` i think they had done the __pre-assessment__ before going in , said that everything appeared to be ok , but then -- even in route -- made the decision -lrb- that -rrb- the risk was too high . '' the second helicopter lost communication with the missing aircraft and returned to begin the search operation , __osterman__ said . that operation has transitioned from rescue to recovery , with the military focused on recovering the helicopter , military officials said . searchers found the helicopter at the bottom of the sound , and the bodies of the seven marines and four army national guard members who were aboard . the bodies of at least two national guard members were recovered thursday , and the remains of the other two were believed to be in the underwater wreckage 25 feet below the surface , the guard said . the crew members were with __1-244th__ assault helicopter battalion from hammond , louisiana , according to a statement from the louisiana national guard . __osterman__ said the remains will be taken to dover air force base in delaware for identification and forensic examinations before being turned over to the soldiers ' families for burial . on friday , __marsoc__ , based at camp lejeune , north carolina , identified the seven marines who perished in the crash as capt. stanford h. shaw , iii , 31 , of basking ridge , new jersey ; master sgt. thomas a. saunders , 33 , of williamsburg , virginia ; staff sgt. marcus s. __bawol__ , 26 , of warren , michigan ; staff sgt. trevor p. __blaylock__ , 29 , of lake orion , michigan ; staff sgt. liam a. flynn , 33 , of queens , new york ; staff sgt. kerry m. kemp , 27 , of port washington , wisconsin ; and staff sgt. andrew c. __seif__ , 26 , of holland , michigan . they gave all : profiles of those killed in helicopter crash . the names of the four louisiana national guard members were not released . `` to have such a tremendous group of marines -- obviously the experience that they had , the cohesion and teamwork and everything else that they exhibited -- it definitely hit us all hard by having that many at one time , '' __osterman__ said of the deaths . the cause of the crash is under investigation . mark giuliano , chief of the __eglin__ air force base 's fire department , said a couple of military boats already were in the water for safety purposes as part of the exercise but that `` nobody saw anything because of the dense fog . '' `` people said they heard a loud bang , and that was it , '' giuliano said thursday . the second black hawk -- which , like the first , was assigned to the __1-244th__ assault helicopter battalion based in hammond , louisiana -- safely returned to the base , some 40 miles east of pensacola . `` whatever the trouble was with the one aircraft , it did not involve the second helicopter that was participating in the exercise , '' __eglin__ spokesman andy __bourland__ said earlier this week . giuliano said the fire department , which has a unit on santa rosa island near the crash site , was called to help at about 10 p.m. tuesday , roughly 90 minutes after the crash . the military boats that were part of the mission already had been searching for survivors and wreckage , he said . military officials have said it 's too early to know whether the fog contributed to the crash . the 11 service members , all men , were involved in a seven-day training exercise of amphibious operations , said capt. barry morris , a spokesman for the u.s. marines corps special operations command . it involved small boats , and inserting and extracting marines from the water via helicopter . morris would not say which phase of the training the marines were in tuesday night . the initial search was hampered by dense fog , to the point that searchers on boats `` could not see , '' giuliano said . on wednesday morning , after searchers got a sonar hit , a diver found the bulk of the wreck at the bottom of the sound , giuliano said . divers then went into the water `` to start retrieving the aircrew , '' giuliano said , without specifying how many bodies were recovered . the helicopter had broken into several pieces in a `` __high-impact__ crash , '' he said . the coast guard has hired a salvage company from mobile , alabama , to take the wreckage from the water , giuliano said . on wednesday , gen. martin dempsey , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said the crash was `` a reminder to us that those who serve put themselves at risk , both in training and in combat . '' `` we will work with the services to ensure that ... their family members will be well cared for .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- its a high stakes game of stick or twist with billions of dollars at stake . traditionally at this time of year , a clutch of nervous owners in charge of struggling clubs in england 's top flight grapple with the prospect of relegation , and the enormous hole it threatens to blow in their finances . do they stick by a floundering manager hoping he can regroup and lead his team out of the mire , or do they get rid and hope the appointment of new coach can transform its fortunes ? on monday , sunderland 's american owner ellis short elected to twist and fired the club 's uruguayan manager gus poyet , confirmed by a statement on its official website . less than a year ago poyet masterminded a miraculous run of form that saw the north east outfit triumph at chelsea and manchester united in order to stave off the threat of demotion . now that task is for someone else as short and sunderland try to protect the cool $ __106m__ it pocketed last season , with one eye on the new television deal in 2016 that 's worth over $ 7.8 billion to the premier league 's 20 clubs . `` it 's inevitable sunderland will have been thinking about money , '' simon chadwick , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at coventry university , told cnn . `` particularly television money , because it now accounts for over 50 % of most , if not all , premier league clubs ' turnover . `` it 'd be very easy to say they are thinking long term about money and long term about the next television contract but in reality , very often it is short term thinking . `` whilst i 'm sure sunderland are mindful of what 's going to happen in 2016 , they 'll be even more mindful of what 's going to happen in the summer of 2015 if they go down . '' the tipping point came saturday when fellow strugglers aston villa fired in four unanswered first-half goals against sunderland , having scored four away goals in its previous 14 premier league matches . some fans streamed out of the stadium of light before halftime while one group tried to storm the home dugout to confront poyet . it left sunderland just one point away from the drop zone and was enough to convince billionaire short to swing the axe , the financial implications no doubt rattling round his mind . even though cardiff city , which finished bottom of the premier league last season , still banked $ __92.1__ m for its efforts , the disparity between tiers one and two in england is vast . `` most obviously , the tv revenues from the premier league deal , '' chadwick answered when asked what sunderland stands to lose if it does fall through the __trapdoor__ . `` also attendances tend to diminish rapidly so your two biggest sources of revenue are almost instantaneously undermined . `` i would n't want to put a figure on it but you 're talking tens of millions heading up towards potentially hundreds of millions . '' ironically , aston villa were __marshaled__ to victory on saturday by its new manager tim sherwood , installed in the wake of paul lambert 's sacking in february . villa 's american owner randy lerner , who is in the process of trying to sell the club , decided to act after a miserable run of form that saw them score just 12 goals in its opening 25 epl matches . after saturday 's win , the birmingham club is now three points clear of the relegation places and short will be hoping for a similar bounce when he appoints a new man . according to chadwick , research shows a change of manager at this late stage of the campaign can provide all-important impetus , but he argues there are few `` impact managers '' available at present . and he suggests the approach of short and lerner proves american owners still do n't fully understand the dynamic of english football as well as they perhaps should . `` it 's easy to succumb to fan pressure and results but there 's a particular culture in football generally -- obviously inside clubs as well -- and i 'm not sure american owners are in tune with that , '' he said . `` we 've seen it with aston villa -- this is probably a prime example of an owner that many people speak highly of even now but i do n't think they understand local communities or the somewhat parochial nature sometimes of english football still . `` so they are making decisions that are not entirely culturally consistent with their experiences and the experiences of english football clubs . '' chadwick also says the bumper television revenue afforded to clubs in modern football has created a tiered premier league in which few teams outside the established giants can realistically expect to compete at the top end . `` in one sense , it 's always been like this , '' he said . `` you go back to the 1980s when liverpool were dominant -- some teams knew they were n't going to be champions . `` i think the television revenues have cemented that position of the dominant teams . `` whilst the premier league would argue it 's a progressive system in the sense that the collective deal does allocate finances to clubs that perhaps those in spain do n't have , even so , such is the magnitude of the payments made to the achieving clubs its almost inevitable you will get the likes of manchester united , arsenal and the rest dominating . `` for the likes of the north east clubs sunderland , newcastle and middlesbrough it is great if they can get there , even better if they can stay there .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- schools in new york city have decided to observe two muslim holidays and close schools for them . after all , for decades , kids have gotten christian and jewish holidays off . why not add muslim holidays to the list ? conservative family research council president tony perkins went predictably __apoplectic__ , saying that it was evidence of `` discrimination '' against christians . to perkins , `` family '' apparently does not include `` __non-christian__ families . '' perkins ' position is that kids get easter and christmas off , but we call those holidays `` winter break '' and `` spring break . '' i hate to ally myself with such people , but i sort of agree that mayor bill de blasio 's decision is a bad one . however , not for the reasons expressed by perkins . i simply find it to be a problematic endorsement of religion by the secular state . i can not support the government endorsing religion of any kind . there was once a time when most people considered the united states to be a `` christian '' country . however , that notion was never the intent of our founders and is not consistent with a __pluralistic__ and enlightened nation . unfortunately , even recent events have shown us that there are a lot of ignorant americans who still think islam is `` un-american . '' because of that , i support measures that tell muslims that they are our brothers and sisters , too . nobody should feel less welcome or `` american '' on the basis of the religion they practice , or whether they believe in any religion at all . but this is the wrong way . first of all , virtually every recognized religion is practiced in new york city . unfortunately , now only three of them have some kind of `` officially acknowledged '' status . christians , jews and muslims have their holidays off , but what about new york 's other religions ? what about my religion ? march 6 has long been `` the day of the dude , '' and as a __dudeist__ minister , should i not demand respect for my beliefs , by insisting that the school district `` take ` er easy '' on that date every year ? __pastafarianism__ is a recognized religion . __pastafarians__ believe that every friday is a holiday . perhaps it is time for us all to be touched by the __noodly__ __appendage__ of the flying spaghetti monster on a weekly basis . by selecting only three `` approved '' religions for respect , we send the message that we value the beliefs of some over those of others . such a mentality has no place in a secular country -- even if we have a history of recognizing some __abrahamic__ religions ' holidays . because therein lies a theory behind the establishment clause . we do n't rank belief systems here . in lemon v. __kurtzman__ , __403__ u.s. __602__ -lrb- 1971 -rrb- , the u.s. supreme court gave us a three-part test to determine whether governmental conduct violates the establishment clause : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the governmental action must have a secular purpose , -lrb- 2 -rrb- it must have a principal or primary effect that neither advances nor __inhibits__ religion , and -lrb- 3 -rrb- it may not foster an excessive governmental __entanglement__ with religion . de blasio 's action violates , i think , all three __prongs__ . de blasio should have used this opportunity to change direction , and state that there would be no official religious holidays -- that selecting just the __abrahamic__ vein of religion as officially recognized by the state is simply improper . this would send the right message -- that the government is not going to get involved in matters of religion , at all . this is not to say that i disapprove of any `` cultural '' days off , or even simply pragmatic decisions . for example , in some school districts in new york , 60 % of the students were absent on chinese new year . the new york state legislature authorized local districts to call off school that day , as a practical approach to empty chairs . further , it did not improperly send a message that certain religions were valued over others . i see no problem with kids taking religious days off , if their family 's beliefs require them to . schools can accommodate that kind of thing as easily as they can accommodate kids who get stuck home with the flu . i do n't have a problem with even teaching about different religions ; in fact , i support doing so . but what de blasio did here was wrong . montgomery county , maryland , officials handled it the right way ; they removed all mention of religious holidays on their 2015-16 school calendar , including __rosh__ __hashana__ and christmas . those days are simply `` days off '' as far as the government is concerned . myself , i intend to continue to observe the day of the dude every year by __takin__ ' er easy for all you __sinners__ . i do n't expect you to -- and as much as i would like the government to mandate that we all do so every march 6 , that would simply rot the lemon , so to speak .

'' instead of the pine bush students learning about other languages and cultures , they learned that the `` heckler 's veto '' and phony tales of `` offense '' trump open __mindedness__ and the quest for knowledge . at least they do in modern-day american education . perhaps this is a lesson best learned now , because once they get to college , it will be even worse . our universities were once places where ideas were safe to flourish , and we went to question what we knew . today , they are places where __disfavored__ ideas are all but banned . according to students , dixie state -lrb- utah -rrb- bans posters that `` mock '' anyone , including former president bush . last year , smith college 's president apologized and there was a student outcry because students had `` hurt feelings '' when __alumna__ wendy __kaminer__ argued at a panel discussion moderated by the college president against using the euphemism `` the n-word '' in historical discussions . she believed that using the actual word , in context , was proper -lrb- and it is -rrb- . yes , censorship of ideas and speech is no longer a top-down or __parent-driven__ phenomenon . now students themselves insist on being insulated from anything that might make them question their beliefs . instead of debating an anti-abortion protester , oregon university students preferred to call the campus police -- who briefly took their side . george will was slated to speak at scripps college in a program specifically designed to challenge students ' prevailing views . but , since he challenged the feminist view of sexual assault on campus , scripps pulled his invitation . when i went to college , i enjoyed challenging my beliefs . i still do . i hope that my children constantly do the same . that is how we grow . if we can not tolerate foreign languages , or distasteful ideas , even in an educational setting , what hope do we have ? when we have orthodoxy of thought , the very notion of liberty begins to __shrivel__ up and die . when the cry of `` i 'm offended '' can shut down debate over philosophies , or learning about other cultures , or learning other languages , then what have our educational institutions become ? how much further will this enforced ignorance and orthodoxy need to go before education is just another word that comes __untethered__ from its meaning ? and the very inspiration for this column , a debate over the pledge of allegiance , makes the problem even more glaring . a __rote__ and __thought-free-chant__ of mindless allegiance ca n't even be expressed in a different language ? is america really so fragile that if a citizen proclaims `` __fidelità__ __agli__ __stati__ __uniti__ '' that it means anything less because it is in italian ? perhaps this highlights more than the fact that we should step away from the brink of ignorance while we can . perhaps a good place to start is by doing away with enforced orthodoxy of thought and speech in the first place . perhaps a good place to do that would be by doing away with the pledge of allegiance itself . perhaps if we pledged to uphold the constitution , instead of a piece of cloth , we would be reminded of what really built this nation -- the spirit of the enlightenment . no views are so sacred that they need not be challenged . whether we are talking about learning to say the pledge in japanese , or hearing a speaker who challenges our beliefs , that is what education is about , not enforced ignorance .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- in an unusual turn of events last week , a terror plot suspect 's desire to talk to local media put him at odds with his attorneys and landed a cincinnati television station in federal court . at issue was a taped audio interview with christopher cornell and whether the station could broadcast that interview . cornell is accused of plotting to attack the u.s. capitol . the 20-year-old -- who claims in the interview that he is affiliated with isis -- was arrested on january 14 , months after his social media habits and talk of jihad put him on the fbi 's radar , according to court documents obtained by cnn at the time of his arrest . two days after his arrest , a court order was issued barring public contact with cornell , who is being held at the boone county jail across the river in kentucky . last week , cornell made a collect call to cnn affiliate __wxix__ , said news director kevin roach . that phone call initiated what ended up being an hourlong interview , roach said . cornell 's attorney , richard __smith-monahan__ , argued that __wxix__ was in contempt of court for violating a january order `` directing the detention facility holding the defendant not to permit outside contact by anyone with the defendant without -lsb- defense counsel 's -rsb- express approval . '' cornell spoke with reporter tricia __macke__ . in that interview , he refuses to tell __macke__ how or when he first came in contact with isis , but he did give the reporter details on a plot to kill president barack obama , members of congress , as well as an attack on the israeli embassy in washington . `` i would have took my gun , '' he said . `` i would have put it to obama 's head . i would have pulled the trigger . then i would unleash more bullets on the senate and house of representative members . and i would have attacked the israeli embassy and various other buildings full of __kafir__ who want to wage war against us muslims . '' when __macke__ asked him why he would plot such an attack , he said `` obama is an enemy of allah , therefore an enemy of us , of islamic state . '' he said his plan for an attack on the u.s. capitol was retaliation for `` the continued american aggression against our people and the fact that america , specifically president obama , wants to wage war against islamic state . '' cornell told __macke__ he was planning what would have been a `` major attack '' to take place in washington on september 20 , repeatedly referring to himself as a member of isis . `` i 'm with the islamic state , '' he said at one point . `` i have connections with many brothers over there . we 've been corresponding for quite some time now , actually . the fbi finally caught on this past year . '' cornell told __macke__ that he used `` encrypted messaging '' to communicate with isis members . he said they discussed `` how we should wage jihad in america . we should form our own groups and alliances with the islamic state , '' he continued . cornell said he was serious about his plans . `` i 'm very dedicated , '' he told __macke__ . `` like i said , i 'm a muslim . i 'm so dedicated that i risked my life . that should say a whole lot . '' he also warned that there were others like himself . `` we are indeed here in america , '' he said . `` we 're in each and every state . we 're here in ohio . we 're more organized than you think . '' the interview was taped in three 20-minute segments and was recorded by the jail and __wxix__ . roach said the jail 's taping system only allows for 20 minutes of taping at one time , so each time the recording would stop and the phone call ended , cornell called the station back to tell his side of the story . cnn listened to the audio recording . during the 6:30 p.m. newscast on thursday , the station aired a brief clip of the audio recording , __previewing__ a longer story that was to air later that night , in the 10 p.m. newscast . according to mike allen , legal analyst and attorney for __wxix__ , a producer from the station called him about 7:30 thursday evening ; cornell 's attorney had filed a `` show of cause '' order in cincinnati 's federal court and an emergency hearing was scheduled for 8:30 p.m. . during that hearing , the judge continued the case for friday morning and __wxix__ agreed to delay broadcasting the interview until friday , pending a decision . in addition to the contempt of court argument , __smith-monahan__ was also asking the court to issue a restraining order against the station , an order that would keep the station from broadcasting the interview with cornell , according to court documents . during the hearing , which lasted five hours , a lieutenant at the boone county facility testified that one of cornell 's attorneys had given him a phone . in that testimony the lieutenant stated that he reminded the attorney that giving cornell a phone meant he would be able to call anyone he wanted to , which seemed at odds with the spirit of the january court order . at the end of friday 's hearing , u.s. district judge sandra beckwith ruled that the order prohibiting cornell from contact with the public was vaguely written and the station was not in violation of the order . additionally , the judge ruled it would be unconstitutional for the news station to be barred from broadcasting the interview , according to allen . the judge also stated in court that while cornell has the right to remain silent , he also has the right to freedom of speech . `` at the end of the day , the judge made the right decision , '' allen said . cnn on saturday reached out to __smith-monahan__ , cornell 's defense attorney , but so far has received no response . __wxix__ aired a portion of the interview on friday night , and plans to broadcast more this week . cnn 's vivian kuo contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     moscow -lrb- cnn -rrb- russia 's president shares `` political responsibility '' for the assassination of opposition leader boris nemtsov , the late politician 's daughter said friday in her first tv interview since his death in central moscow last week . __zhanna__ __nemtsova__ , who said she has no faith in the russian investigation into the killing , said she believes his death will only deter other opposition voices , rather than embolden them . `` i can not blame him -lrb- putin -rrb- directly , -lrb- but -rrb- i would say that our authorities , including the president of russia , have political responsibility as the head of state , '' __nemtsova__ told cnn 's matthew chance . __nemtsova__ says she has no evidence about who ordered the murder , but that `` it 's evident that it 's politically motivated .

'' __nemtsova__ said she loved her father `` more than anyone else in my life '' and that the two were very close . `` i think that he died a hero , '' she said . `` he was a very brave man , and he was clever , he was a great thinker and he was a brilliant physicist , '' having published dozens of articles on the subject , she said . he was also an economist and pacifist , she said , who most recently had been critical of the kremlin 's handling of the ukraine crisis . `` i know that some russian officials kept saying that he was not dangerous , but ... in an authoritarian regime , any person who does not agree with politics -- who criticizes the official standpoint -- is dangerous , '' __nemtsova__ said . `` that 's why , i think , if you look at other regimes , like in russia , you will see that all opponents to the official line are in danger , under threat . '' nemtsov was a top official with the republican party of __russia-party__ of people 's freedom , a liberal opposition group . he served as deputy prime minister in the late 1990s under president boris yeltsin . early in his career , he was governor of __nizhniy__ __novgorod__ , a major economic hub . `` i think that now , russia has crossed the line after this murder , and people will be frightened to express their ideas which contradict ... the official standpoint , '' __nemtsova__ said . cnn 's matthew chance reported from moscow . cnn 's melissa gray reported and wrote from atlanta .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- two former neighbors of justin bieber have filed a lawsuit against the pop star , claiming he and his bodyguards repeatedly harassed them and their family , vandalized their house with eggs and threatened them with anti-semitic remarks . in the lawsuit jeffrey and suzanne schwartz say bieber hosted frequent loud parties and spat in jeffrey schwartz ' face after he complained about the pop star driving his ferrari at dangerous speeds down the street of their gated community in calabasas , california . the suit , filed thursday in los angeles superior court , also alleges bieber 's bodyguards dismissed jeffrey schwartz 's complaints by taunting him repeatedly with `` what are you going to do about it , jew boy ? '' the suit seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial . representatives for bieber did not immediately respond to requests for comment thursday afternoon . the lawsuit comes after bieber , 21 , pleaded guilty last july to a misdemeanor vandalism charge stemming from a january 9 , 2014 incident in which the __schwartzes__ ' house was pelted with dozens of eggs . bieber agreed to pay $ __80,900__ in restitution for damages to the house and was placed on two years ' probation . it 's the latest chapter in a string of legal troubles for the polarizing former teen idol , who in recent years has been convicted of careless driving and resisting arrest and is facing dangerous driving and assault charges after his atv collided with a minivan last august in canada . thursday 's lawsuit alleges a nine-month pattern of `` offensive '' behavior by bieber and members of his entourage from march 2013 to january 2014 . the __schwartzes__ , who lived next door to bieber , claim the harassment escalated after a march 27 , 2013 episode in which bieber spat in jeffrey schwartz ' face and threatened to `` f -- ing kill '' him . the following year , after the egging episode made headlines , the __schwartzes__ say they and their children were subject to `` constant harassment '' by bieber 's entourage , fans and the media . the couple are seeking damages on the grounds of assault and battery and infliction of emotional distress . bieber sold the calabasas house for $ 7 . 2 million last year to khloe kardashian and has since been renting a $ __60,000-a-month__ home in beverly hills , according to forbes .

ARTICEL:     port gibson , mississippi -lrb- cnn -rrb- an african-american man is found hanging from a tree in the mississippi woods with __bedsheets__ around his neck attached to a limb 15 feet above the ground . there 's no chair in sight . his feet are 2 to 3 feet off the ground . his hands are not bound . is this a suicide ? or is it a lynching -- a shadow from the south 's history of racial violence __re-emerging__ ? those were the big questions friday , one day after authorities found a man 's body with __bedsheets__ around his neck in port gibson , a small town of just over 1,500 people in rural __claiborne__ county , about 60 miles southwest of jackson , the state capital . evidence collected so far does n't suggest foul play in the death , law enforcement officials said . for that reason , suicide is the early theory as the likely manner of death , the officials said . __claiborne__ county sheriff marvin lucas on friday identified the man as otis byrd . even though authorities have confirmed his name , they still have a lot of work ahead to figure out how byrd died and who is responsible . `` it could take a week , it could take two weeks , it could take months , '' lucas said . authorities expect to receive a preliminary report next week on what caused byrd 's death , donald __alway__ , special agent in charge of the fbi office in jackson , said friday afternoon at a press conference . he said 30 agents from the fbi , the mississippi bureau of investigation and other agencies are looking for friends and family of the victim `` that might help paint a picture on the cause of death of mr. byrd . '' agents have finished searching the area where the body was found and are looking at a `` storage location '' byrd owned that might yield information , __alway__ said . __alway__ said the fbi is communicating with the family and wo n't comment on rumors circulating about the death . `` the community deserves answers , '' he said . `` the family deserves answers . '' the body was found at 10:21 a.m. thursday , deep in a forest about 500 yards from the house byrd was renting , according to lucas . a __skullcap__ had been pulled over his head , the sheriff said . that house was the last place where byrd had been seen on march 2 , according to the sheriff . he was reported missing a week later , spurring a search . the body was found by staffers from the mississippi department of wildlife , fisheries and parks who were taking part in the search , lucas said . thursday was the first time authorities looked specifically in the wooded area where the body was found , according to the sheriff . a family member who did not want to be identified said byrd was not acting out of the ordinary in the days before he went missing . he went to church , he worked and occasionally ventured to a casino , according to the family member , who described byrd as a `` good , hardworking man . '' byrd had been in prison . he was convicted in 1980 of murdering a woman , but was paroled in 2006 , according to the mississippi department of corrections . no one has given any indication publicly whether byrd had enemies . what distinguishes a suicidal hanging from a lynching ? thomas martin , a veteran crime scene investigator and president of crime scene forensics llc , said he knew nothing about the mississippi case but had investigated other deaths by hanging or strangulation . injuries to the dead person indicate lynching , he said , because it means the dead person struggled with other people before being hanged . when people are strangled by somebody else , investigators sometimes find the deceased has grabbed at the ligature and left finger marks and even bits of fingernails around his neck , he said . the direction of the ligature is another indicator , martin said . when people hang themselves , the rope often rides up directly behind the ears , he said . when a person is hanged by other people , the ligature moves differently on the neck , he said . martin said these are general observations and that `` the facts are what make or break the case . '' mississippi naacp chapter president derrick johnson issued a statement calling on `` federal authorities to immediately investigate the hanging death of mr. otis byrd . '' the fbi already is looking into any federal civil rights violations and has a forensics team on the scene . the u.s. department of justice civil rights division and u.s. attorney for the southern district of mississippi are also investigating , according to a spokeswoman for the justice department . the mississippi bureau of investigation also is investigating . fbi supervisory special agent jason pack told __wapt__ that `` it 's too early to say what happened or speculate about the cause or the manner '' of death . `` we do n't know what happened out there , '' pack said . `` we do n't know if it was a suicide , if it was a homicide . that 's why we investigate these types of cases . '' lucas , who is himself african-american , said friday that he 's worried people will jump to the conclusion that byrd was murdered and that race was a factor . `` i do n't want the community to go excited saying it was a __white-on-black__ thing . that 's the worst thing that can happen , is people making it into a race issue , '' lucas said . `` and that 's my biggest fear . and i do n't want that to happen . cnn 's ed lavandera and jason morris reported from mississippi , and cnn 's greg botelho wrote this story from atlanta . cnn 's evan perez , alexandra jaffe and wesley __bruer__ contributed to this report .

'' the emotions came rushing back when durst -- the focus of hbo 's true crime documentary series `` the jinx '' -- was charged with first-degree murder this week in the 2000 killing of his longtime confidante , susan berman . durst 's lawyer has denied his client was involved in berman 's death . `` everything he does is totally unexpected , '' she said . durst , 71 , appeared to be preparing for life on the run when fbi agents arrested him in a new orleans hotel on saturday . in his room , agents found more than $ 40,000 in cash , a handgun , marijuana and a __neck-to-head__ latex mask to alter his appearance . he 's being held on drug and weapons charges in louisiana as he awaits extradition to los angeles . the last time durst was accused of murder was in galveston . though he was acquitted in the death of his neighbor , durst later served nine months in prison on felony weapons charges stemming from that case . days before christmas 2005 , __criss__ ran into the man whose real estate developer family is among new york 's wealthiest at houston 's the galleria mall . durst , who was on parole at the time , was on his cellphone . he had his head down . `` i was glad because i could get my composure , '' __criss__ recalled . it was the first time __criss__ had seen durst outside court , `` in the free world , '' as she put it . `` i needed to not show any fear , '' she remembered thinking . `` i got my poker face on . '' `` hey , i know you , '' she said durst told her . he appeared startled and dropped his phone . fumbling to pick up the pieces of his phone , durst said , `` you 're judge __criss__ . i did not recognize you without the robe , '' she recalled . `` how are you doing , bob . '' durst told her that he could n't believe she stopped to talk to him . `` i have a job to do but it 's not personal . '' there was small talk about cases durst 's lawyers were working . `` i thought , ` oh my god , how do i get out of this ? how do i exit , ' '' said __criss__ , who then wished durst a happy holiday . durst said he was impressed that she had stopped to chat . `` he seemed genuinely touched , '' __criss__ said . she turned around and walked away . she wanted to look back at him but did n't want to seem concerned . `` i started calling my mom and staff and my friends -- you 're not going to believe who i saw ? they said i should call security . for what ? to tell them he 's shopping . '' the galleria mall was not listed on the places durst could go during his parole , said __criss__ , who was a witness at a subsequent parole hearing . the former judge said police officers told her that durst had also been spotted outside the home where morris black was killed . a secretary in the district attorney 's office saw durst driving behind the galveston courthouse , __criss__ said . a condition of durst 's parole was that he could only visit places where his parole officer permitted him , __criss__ said . his parole was not revoked . when court officials called durst 's lawyer dick __deguerin__ to inquire about his presence near the courthouse , the lawyer said his client was visiting a psychiatrist in the area . __deguerin__ could not be reached friday for comment about what __criss__ said about his client . `` there could be no good reason to come back to these places , '' __criss__ said . she started to become concerned . in `` the jinx , '' durst described the time he spent living in vermont with his first wife , kathleen , running a health food store in the 1970s . in 1982 , kathleen mccormack durst went missing . durst said he last saw her when he dropped her off at a train station in __katonah__ , new york , and she headed to their manhattan apartment . her family said they believe she 's dead and that durst is to blame . the case has never been solved . durst has denied any involvement in her disappearance . `` it 's a nightmare watching it unfold because you could see that justice is n't going to be done , '' __criss__ said of the durst case and its many tentacles . one day in june 2006 , __criss__ said , that nightmare arrived on a walkway just feet from the doorstep of her home . she blames durst . `` it was part of severed cat and it had been cut right behind the shoulders , '' __criss__ said . `` so it had the head and it had the two front legs . it was a small , pretty little gray cat . it was placed very carefully . it was n't just tossed . it was very neatly laid there . it was perfectly cleaned . this had obviously had been killed somewhere else and brought here . '' the animal 's head was perfectly severed . `` what was the key piece of evidence in our case that was n't there that would have given no doubt whatsoever that this was not self-defense -- the severed head , '' __criss__ said , referring to morris black , whose dismembered body was recovered but not his head . __criss__ thought of the two __dachshunds__ she had at home . she checked and the dogs were fine . `` i was in a panic , '' she recalled . `` i was just distraught . '' the police were contacted . even the galveston police chief arrived at the scene , __criss__ said . a veterinarian determined that the cat had been killed by a person . forensic tests found no dna under the claws . there was no evidence linking durst to the incident . `` they thought i was paranoid and crazy , that i was overreacting , '' __criss__ said . galveston det. rick __mccullor__ said he was part of the investigation but declined to comment further . in an email to the bonnie __quiroga__ , head of the galveston office of justice administration , __criss__ talked about getting blinds for her windows and cameras for the courthouse . she recommended getting the door locks fixed . cnn obtained a copy of the email . `` his message is he knows where i live -lrb- and -rrb- this is what he is capable of , '' she wrote . __criss__ said she thought about evidence at the murder trial . the medical examiner testified that the person who dismembered black knew exactly what tools cut through muscle and bone . then the judge started receiving instant messages from unknown __senders__ . one said , `` did you like your package ? '' __criss__ contacted the fbi , which , she said , for nine months had cameras set up around her home . __criss__ said agents determined the message was sent from london . they found no link to durst . the agent involved in the case did not return requests for comment . __criss__ started carrying a gun . her parents always reminded her to keep her doors locked . `` there was a period of time after that where i not only did carry a gun , i had guns and weapons hidden throughout my home , '' she said . `` what if he breaks in and the gun is at the other end of the house ? people did think i was crazy . '' she hid the butcher knives in her __breadbox__ . `` if something happen , i 'd know where they were , '' she said . `` i lived like that . i believe that somebody really bad came to my home to send a message to me . '' __criss__ ' obsession with the durst case is such that she has been working on a book she wants to title `` descent into madness . '' the final chapter keeps changing . `` every time you think you 've reached the highest level of __weirdness__ , we go again , '' __criss__ said . she knows more than she needs to know about durst and his __peculiarities__ : how he used to prepare for court sessions in the holding cell doing naked jumping jacks . how whenever he 's arrested , officers find guns , drugs and stacks of __metamucil__ . she learned the reason for the last item from listening to 32 hours of durst 's recorded jailhouse phone calls . `` this man , his day , every day of his life , is defined as a success or not a success by how going and doing no. 2 went , '' she said . `` that was a part of the conversations with him ... it had to happen at a certain time of day or his whole day was shot . the court staff used to joke that __rearranging__ the court schedule was going to upset bob 's schedule . '' a few years back , while __criss__ was campaigning for re-election and working the polls , a man approached her . __criss__ said it was a juror from the durst trial , a man who had befriended the defendant , visited him in jail and dined with him at times . he must have seen a media report about the severed cat head . `` it seemed like he 's inappropriately happy to be asking me this question -- ` hey , did anything ever happen about that cat head at your house ? ' '' __criss__ recalled . `` i 'm thinking to myself : you son of a bitch . i lied . i know the police were n't doing anything about it . i said , ` oh yes , the police think they know who did . his demeanor changed and he could n't get away fast enough .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- during the three years that i was serving as a member of tunisia 's constituent assembly , i would frequently walk to work through the gate of the __bardo__ museum so i could get a glimpse of the mosaics , and perhaps enjoy the adjoining herb garden . the museum , in downtown tunis , serves not only as a physical reminder of tunisia 's roman , jewish , christian and islamic heritage , but is also connected to the tunisian parliament . i used to love these peaceful moments on the way to work . sadly , they will likely never feel quite the same again . on wednesday , that kind of mood was shattered as the museum came under siege . more than two dozen people were killed as gunmen armed with kalashnikovs opened fire , sending men , women and children scrambling through the lion gate to escape . the members of parliament who were evacuated were , ironically , discussing an anti-terror bill in a committee . two of the attackers -- who were killed during the assault -- have been identified , and the security minister on friday indicated the pair had been activated from a sleeper cell , although at the time of writing authorities had yet to announce a link to a specific jihadist group . however , the attack followed the release of videos purportedly from the islamic state of iraq and syria threatening tunisia . meanwhile , individuals associated with the banned tunisian organization ansar al-sharia declared allegiance to isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi . all this has left some wondering if the museum attack marks a shift in strategy for isis . have salafist terrorists moved beyond their usual __guerrilla-style__ operations to suicidal attacks outside iraq and syria ? if they have , then our political leaders -- who have already been vocal about their commitment to combating terrorism , and have been collaborating with turkey to prevent tunisians entering syria -- will need to redouble their efforts . the threat posed by terrorism to tunisian citizens and our guests ca n't be downplayed , much less ignored . however , the reality is that a comprehensive strategy is still wanting , a point made in a recent report published by the tunisian institute for strategic studies , tunisia 's foremost think tank on political , economic and environmental matters . indeed , the institute , which has tracked the upsurge in salafi jihadi recruitment in tunisia based on __fieldwork__ and interviews with tunisian jihadists , has documented how the phenomenon has largely unfolded outside the media 's view . so , how should we respond ? some mps have demanded the immediate passage of a new anti-terror law , and have been dismissive of the need to focus on human rights at a time of crisis . however , wednesday 's attack does n't change the fact that we already have an anti-terror law that applies ; simply passing a new version of a law will not stop a repeat . instead , tunisians should build on the stable institutions we have in place to implement some of the key ideas contained in the institute 's report . for example , rather than rely exclusively on the tunisian security apparatus for short-term gain , we need to better engage the tunisian public in our common struggle against salafi terrorists . part of this means beating the terrorists at the recruitment game . tunisians yearn for a sense that the state recognizes their humanity , dignity and value as individuals , not just as potential voters and taxpayers . with this in mind , it is clear that the tunisian state has done a poor job of `` recruiting '' its citizens into the fold , which has left space for terrorists to make a pitch for young tunisians who feel alienated and who have lost hope . of course , a robust police response is required to contain salafi __jihadism__ . but this must be matched by an equivalent civil response to uproot the problem . that is why as law enforcement fans out across the country to investigate and protect , i hope also to see educators and trained social workers traveling to rural and impoverished areas of tunisia to demonstrate that the state has recovered the kind of humanity that was lost during decades of __police-state__ , authoritarian stagnation . wednesday 's attack was tragic . but to move forward , we must not be tempted to fall back on our past .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- a manager at an indiana veterans hospital has been placed on paid administrative leave after sending a `` completely and totally unacceptable '' email apparently mocking mental illness . the email , sent by robin paul , `` in no way reflects the attitudes of our staff toward our patients , '' __roudebush__ va medical center director tom __mattice__ said in a statement posted on the hospital 's facebook page . paul , a licensed clinical social worker , had been managing the seamless transition integrated care clinic , which is responsible for assisting new veterans with their va benefits , services and programs , to include mental health , according to the veterans of foreign wars . her email , first published by the indy star this week , was sent december 18 to members of her team and shows four photos of an elf in different scenarios . two of the photos have struck a nerve with the veterans and mental illness communities . in one photograph , the elf appears leaning over what looks like a straw and coffee grounds on a paper plate , with a post-it note that says , `` out of xanax - please help ! '' the caption reads , `` __self-medicating__ for mental health issues when a __cns__ would not give him his requested script . '' in another , the elf is hanging from a string of christmas lights . `` caught in the act of suicidal behavior -lrb- trying to hang himself from an electrical cord -rrb- , '' the caption says . john thomas is a veteran of the korean and vietnam wars and serves as a leader at an indianapolis american legion post . he said the email makes him sick and angry . `` i ca n't understand anybody who would do anything like this to us , '' thomas told cnn affiliate wish . hospital leadership was allegedly made aware of the email a couple of months ago , according to the indy star , and had `` __administratively__ addressed '' the incident with paul . but since the story went viral , the __roudebush__ va facebook page has been inundated with commenters calling for paul to be fired . matthew conrad on facebook said , `` robin paul 's continued employment is an insult to every veteran who has served this country . '' __mattice__ announced paul 's leave , and a pending investigation , tuesday evening . but many say it 's not enough . `` firing her would be the first step in showing you are truly committed to the veterans ' health and well-being . action speaks louder than words , '' elizabeth sanchez wrote on facebook . two of the country 's largest veterans organizations have also criticized paul 's actions . `` it is absolutely inexcusable that a va supervisor would make light of any issue that veterans face , '' __vfw__ national commander john w. stroud said in a statement . `` the __vfw__ demands she be replaced as program manager . '' the american legion also expressed their discontent , saying they take `` health care for veterans very seriously . '' `` veterans suffering from tbi and ptsd should not be held up to ridicule , '' their statement read . john __crimmins__ was one of a few who came to the hospital 's defense . `` as a veteran who receives care at the __rodebush__ va medical center , i find this apology to be acceptable . we 're all prone to doing stupid things . i 'm sure ms. paul has received a reprimand for her actions . she does n't need to lose her job . now , let 's move on , '' he wrote on the va 's facebook page . __mattice__ , who was not available for comment wednesday , did not elaborate on the investigation into the incident , or why it took so long to move forward with placing paul on leave , but instead asked for forgiveness . `` i ask veterans to accept my apology for this failure , and to allow us to continue to demonstrate to you our commitment to your health and well-being , '' he said . this incident is the latest in what has been a tumultuous year for the veterans affairs department . cnn 's months-long investigation into deaths due to long wait times for veterans at va hospitals led to the resignation of veterans affairs secretary eric shinseki . cnn 's attempts to reach paul were unanswered as of wednesday afternoon .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the recent controversy over a video showing university of oklahoma students , who also were members of the sigma alpha epsilon fraternity , reciting a racist chant revealed a key difference in approaches to parenting . the university said levi pettit and parker rice encouraged their brothers to sing the lyrics , which included multiple references to the `` n-word '' and mention of lynching . the two young men were expelled . and the fraternity was shut down . what caught my attention was the reaction of the families -- the __pettits__ and the __rices__ . they could n't have been more different . that convinced me that this story was n't just about racist and juvenile behavior , but also about parenting . who raised these kids ? and should n't they have been taught better ? at some point , did n't it occur to these young men that they were not only shaming themselves , but also their families ? in dallas , protesters gathered outside the rice home , holding signs with messages such as : `` racism is taught . '' parker rice issued a statement , which was delivered to the dallas morning news by his father , bob rice . in it , parker apologized for actions that he called `` wrong and reckless . '' however , bob rice had no response to the controversy . he told reporters : `` at the moment , we are not doing interviews . '' that is not good enough . parenthood is n't like politics . it does n't come with a `` no comment '' button we can press when the job gets uncomfortable . we have n't heard from levi pettit . his parents , brody and susan , addressed their son 's misbehavior in a statement , which was given to the newspaper and posted on the family 's website . it read in part : . `` as parents of levi , we love him and care for him deeply . he made a horrible mistake , and will live with the consequences forever . however , we also know the depth of our son 's character . he is a good boy , but what we saw in those videos is disgusting . while it may be difficult for those who only know levi from the video to understand , we know his heart , and he is not a racist . ... `` of course , we are sad for our son -- but more importantly , we apologize to the community he has hurt . we would also like to apologize to the entire african-american community , university of oklahoma student body and administration . our family has the responsibility to apologize , and also to seek forgiveness and reconciliation . '' that 's an impressive statement . i applaud the __pettits__ for stepping up and refusing to blindly defend their son , as many parents might have done . they did what parents are supposed to do : they took responsibility for the actions of the person they raised . who knew that would be so controversial ? ever since the apologies were offered , there 's been discussions in this country about whether it 's really necessary for parents to apologize for the actions of their grown children . last week , while hosting a radio show in san diego , i brought up the story of the video and pointed to the different approaches that the __rices__ and the __pettits__ have to parenting -- all the way from `` we are not doing interviews '' to `` our family has the responsibility to apologize . '' the __pettits__ had the right idea , i insisted . a caller disagreed , saying he did n't see why he should have to apologize if his adult son did something wrong . `` he 's his own person , '' he said . based on what i 've heard in the last few days , i would imagine that there are many people who agree with the caller . they seem to believe that , when their son or daughter turns 18 , their job is finished . they ca n't wait to wash their hands of any additional responsibility , and they might even frame their retreat as a way of advancing the principle that everyone should take responsibility for his own actions . that sounds good . but i do n't think it 's __either/or__ . of course , individuals should take responsibility for their actions . yet , as the __pettits__ demonstrated with their statement , when something goes terribly wrong , there is usually enough responsibility to go around . when appropriate , parents can take a slice . besides , i bet a lot of parents believe -- as i do -- that we should never stop loving our children . but at some point , it 's perfectly fine for us to just stop claiming them as our own ? it just looks like some parents ca n't wait to find the exit . here 's an idea . we tell people to drink responsibly . we tell them to drive responsibly . we need to start telling them to parent responsibly . after all , parenting a child is the most important job that many of us will have in this world . and there is no date of retirement .

ARTICEL:     __montabaur__ , germany -lrb- cnn -rrb- co-pilot andreas __lubitz__ 's voice is n't heard in a recording of the final moments of __germanwings__ flight __9525__ . but investigators say he was the one at the controls inside the cockpit , deliberately locking out the plane 's captain and setting the plane on a crash course for the french alps . andreas __lubitz__ had medical note for day of crash , hid illness , officials say . the only sound the recorder picked up from __lubitz__ as the airbus a320 went down , marseille prosecutor brice robin said , was the co-pilot 's steady breathing . authorities did n't mince words thursday as they blamed __lubitz__ for the crash , but questions are still swirling over the 27-year-old 's past . officials say __lubitz__ passed a psychological test when he was hired , had no known ties to terrorism and showed no sign of medical distress during the flight . it seems , robin said , that __lubitz__ `` wanted to destroy the aircraft . '' but why ? lufthansa ceo ` speechless ' it 's a question police were trying to answer as they searched __lubitz__ 's apartment in dusseldorf . police spokesman markus __niesczery__ said a team of five investigators went `` through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot 's motivation might have been , if he did indeed bring the plane down . '' about 85 miles -lrb- 136 km -rrb- away in the town of __montabaur__ , the house where __lubitz__ 's parents live was shuttered and guarded by police . a group of men , perhaps investigators , were the only ones granted access . this town in western germany is where __lubitz__ pursued his love of flying from a young age . at a club on the outskirts of __montabaur__ , pilots who knew __lubitz__ said they were shocked to hear what investigators said . they said the man they know never would have deliberately crashed a plane . between the ages of 14 and 20 , __lubitz__ was a regular fixture at the gliding club . '' -lrb- he was -rrb- a very normal young person , full of energy , '' klaus __radke__ said . `` what can i say ? he had a bright future . he made his hobby into his job . what more can you hope to achieve ? '' the authorities ' explanation does n't ring true for peter __ruecker__ , another pilot who knew him from the flight club . `` knowing andreas , this is just inconceivable for me , '' __ruecker__ told the reuters news agency . `` he was a lot of fun , even though he was perhaps sometimes a bit quiet , '' __ruecker__ said . `` he was just another boy , like so many others here .

'' `` it 's a very good family , '' the neighbor said . `` they have a good connection within the family and they are engaged in the community . '' an __8-minute__ descent to death . __lubitz__ had been with __germanwings__ , a budget airline owned by lufthansa , since september 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time , the airline 's media office said . lufthansa ceo __carsten__ __spohr__ told reporters that __lubitz__ `` interrupted '' his training , which he began in 2008 . that break lasted several months , he said , but added that such an interruption is n't uncommon . __spohr__ said he could n't give any information about why the co-pilot had stopped and then restarted his training . if it was for medical reasons , he said , then that information would have been private before the crash , he said , but it will be part of information gathered during the investigation . most of __lubitz__ 's training took place at the lufthansa flight training center in bremen . he also trained in the united states , spending six months at facility in arizona as part of a required program to get his license , a lufthansa spokesperson said . __spohr__ said lufthansa pilots get medical testing but do not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they are flying . however , the airline does consider an applicant 's psychological state , along with other factors , when hiring pilots , he said . __lubitz__ and the captain passed a psychological test when they were hired , he said . `` we do n't only look at competence but we also give a lot of room to psychological capabilities , '' __spohr__ said . `` he was 100 % set to fly without restrictions , '' he added . `` his flight performance was perfect . there was nothing to worry about .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- when i received an advance copy of a book called `` moody __bitches__ '' last month , i was immediately intrigued . i have been called moody , and the `` b '' word , but never have both terms been used -- at once -- to describe me . -lrb- at least not that i know of ! -rrb- . had i been labeled a moody `` b '' in the past , i certainly would have taken it as a major insult . but today , if someone called me that , i think i would say , `` thank you for describing who i am and who we , women , are . there is nothing wrong with being moody , emotional or irritable . '' that provocative title , `` moody __bitches__ : the truth about the drugs you 're taking , the sleep you 're missing , the sex you 're not having and what 's really making you crazy , '' got me thinking about whether our __emotionality__ , our monthly ups and downs during our menstrual cycle , should be viewed as such a negative after all . opinion : are drugs stifling women ? `` women have this idea that we are supposed to not be moody and we 're supposed to tamp down that __moodiness__ , '' said julie holland , author of `` moody __bitches__ '' and a psychiatrist who has practiced in new york for 20 years . `` it 's like a problem to be fixed and really , i think it 's our greatest asset . it 's certainly our greatest psychological asset . '' after all , our empathetic nature helps us understand __nonverbal__ babies -- and __not-always-the-most-communicative__ husbands and partners . our intuition helps us sense people 's motivations . our emotions help us realize when something is wrong in our lives . so , why on earth have all of those qualities come to be viewed as a source of weakness , not strength ? and why is at least one in four american women taking some form of psychiatric medication , including antidepressants , versus one in seven men , according to holland ? some of these women definitely should be taking antidepressants and other medications , but the question is why are so many other women taking them when they do n't need to be ? this is you on stress ? those were just some of the many questions a group of us chatted about over coffee recently : holland , cnn legal analyst sunny hostin , cosmopolitan executive editor leslie __yazel__ and me . __yazel__ , a mom of a 4-year-old , wondered if people are afraid of being unhappy . `` i do think that people are afraid to be sad and they 're afraid to be scared , '' holland said . `` i think we spend a lot of time and energy pushing down emotions that are uncomfortable for us . i do n't want to cry right now . i do n't want to be angry . i do n't want to be scared so we push it down , but the problem with pushing it down is it takes a lot of energy and it ends up creating a lot of tension . '' social media , with the endless barrage of __gorgeous-looking__ pictures from family and friends who appear to be having the most perfect lives , certainly does n't help . in fact , a recent study showed that heavy facebook users experience envy , which could lead to extreme sadness and depression . `` everyone 's __instagraming__ their best , most fabulous , __freakin__ ' pictures , and they 're looking so skinny and beautiful and so happy , and they 're going on vacation ... and then you compare it to your life , '' said hostin , a mom of two . it 's not a real or genuine life , holland said . `` it 's plastic . '' but when more and more women __medicate__ away their emotions when they do n't need to be taking antidepressants or any other psychiatric drugs , they create a `` new normal , '' she said . postpartum depression : one mom 's mission becomes a movement . `` it 's like doping and biking , or steroids and baseball . if everybody is doing it , then the ones who do n't are at a disadvantage , '' said holland , who is also the author of the best-selling memoir `` weekends at bellevue . '' `` if everyone is getting boob jobs , then people who do n't end up feeling __flat-chested__ . '' and when it seems more normal than not to be on mental health meds , the bar is lowered for when women will go on antidepressants , she said . women who are __medicating__ away their emotions when they do n't need to be might not realize there are major effects to their decision . notably , they find it more difficult to cry -- and tougher to orgasm . `` i certainly talk to my patients about sexual side effects . it comes up all the time . in our first meeting , i ask ... ` is it hard for you to climax because this may end up being an issue ? it 's going to be even harder ' ... but it 's not like it 's in the advertising , '' holland said . `` it may be in the small print on the back of the ad , or they may say it at lightning speed during the tv commercial . '' women today are subjected to a barrage of advertising -- from daytime talk shows to women 's magazines -- about the medications they could take to make them feel better . women 's desire for sex is complicated , not strictly hormonal , study says . `` twenty years ago , when i started my practice , i had somebody come to me and they would have symptoms , but they did n't quite know what was wrong and what they needed . and now people come to me and it 's like , ` well can you explain the difference between __effexor__ and __wellbutrin__ , and can you tell me which one i should take ? ' '' the conversation `` advanced from ` is there something wrong with me ? do i need medicine ? ' to ` which medicine is right for me ? ' '' said holland , who points to how nine out of 10 of the big pharmaceutical companies spend more on marketing than on research and development . what we 're also seeing , holland said , is a growing belief by women in the workplace that they need the meds to control their emotions at the office . she tells the story of a woman who called her up in tears and said she needed new antidepressants because clearly her current meds were n't preventing her from crying at work . when holland asked her what caused her to cry , she said her boss was being difficult . holland said what was needed was a plan to confront her boss , not a prescription for a new medication . `` i hate to see us __medicating__ away our sensitivity and __emotionality__ for the comfort of other people in the workplace . i think it 's a big mistake . '' thinking about trying to control our __emotionality__ for the comfort of others reminded me of a college relationship , which i shared with hostin , __yazel__ and holland . my boyfriend at the time told me one of my problems -lrb- he clearly thought i had many ! -rrb- was that my highs were too high and my lows were too low . he said i needed to live in the middle . `` you should be more like me , like a man , '' joked holland . clearly , that relationship did n't last very long ! as we wrapped up , i asked the women what the biggest takeaway was for them following our conversation about holland 's thoughtful new book . `` do n't give up your awesome orgasms , '' said __yazel__ . -lrb- amen to that ! -rrb- . `` so it 's ok to be a moody ` b ' ? ' '' hostin asked . `` it 's ok to be a moody ` b , ' '' holland replied . `` our sensitivity and our __emotionality__ is an asset . it 's not a liability . it 's not a symptom that needs to be medicated away . '' how concerned are you that so many women who do n't necessarily need antidepressants are taking them ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter or cnn living on facebook .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- he does n't wear a uniform or hold an official rank , but hadi __al-amari__ is a powerful military leader in iraq . he leads the __hashd__ __al-shaabi__ , a predominantly shia paramilitary force doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take tikrit from isis extremists . ousting isis from tikrit is important for dozens of countries in the united __states-led__ coalition trying to thwart the islamist extremist group 's quest to grow its caliphate . iran is n't a part of this coalition , but it is also working to defeat isis -- something that 's provoked both relief and alarm in washington . __al-amari__ is confident his men , with help from the iraqi army and some sunnis , can crush isis in iraq without this coalition 's help . he 's sure because the iranians are advising them . `` we do n't need it , and we wo n't need it , '' he said . `` anyone who puts their faith in the international coalition to liberate iraq is putting their faith on a mirage . '' iran knows what it 's doing , in his view . `` yes , we declare to the world , we have iranian advisers , and we 're proud of them , and we thank them deeply for participating with us because iran has more experience than anyone else on earth in fighting terrorism . '' does it matter that iran is advising militias fighting isis ? does it matter which countries are taking part in the fight against isis -- including that one of them , iran , is a longstanding u.s. foe ? when asked questions along those lines wednesday in washington , it seemed that even top u.s. military officials did n't have easy answers . the view is that defeating isis is good , while relying on and possibly strengthening iran is not . in other words , iran 's involvement in iraq is a mixed blessing . to make sense of this all , one needs to understand not only the international landscape and iraqi politics , but islam itself . the religion 's two major sects are sunni and shia . in iraq , sunni arabs comprise 15 % to 20 % of iraq 's population , with about half of them in urban areas like baghdad , mosul and tikrit , according to the council on foreign relations . about 18 % of iraq 's population is sunni kurds . that means the vast majority of iraqis are shiite muslims . and it matters . during his decades-long rule , saddam hussein -- a sunni whose hometown is tikrit -- gave positions of power to sunnis , and marginalized shiites , experts say . many shiite families fled to iran and the country gave them housing and jobs and schooled their children . that __imbued__ iraqi shiites who have returned home with a fierce allegiance to iran . __shias__ have led iraq since hussein 's ouster , often alienating sunnis in the process . this has fueled major sectarian rifts that peaked when nuri al-maliki was prime minister , leading to not only millions of disaffected citizens but a weaker central government and military that isis frequently overran in 2013 and 2014 . haider al-abadi took over as prime minister last year in part to address these deep divisions . still , some sunnis have n't seen the change they want : for instance , sheikh __naim__ __al-gaoud__ in february called for direct u.s. arming of sunni tribes like his or at least pressure to make iraq 's government help them more in the fight for anbar province . and shiite militias sometimes have done more to hurt than help the cause of unity . the advocacy group human rights watch has documented what it calls escalating `` abuses by militias allied with iraqi security forces in sunni areas , '' pointing to instances in which residents have been forced from their homes , kidnapped and executed . such treatment has happened in remote areas as well as the iraqi capital , according to the group . `` sunnis are a minority in baghdad , but they 're the majority in our morgue , '' an iraqi health ministry doctor told human rights watch last july . just a few days ago , iraq 's most powerful shiite cleric grand ayatollah ali __al-sistani__ said people `` must always act with self-control , '' according to the new york times . still , there 's hardly a guarantee such calls for restraint will be answered , especially amid the chaos of war . the fear is that mostly shia militias , like the one led by __al-amari__ , will inflame the __tinderbox__ of sectarian strife -- with human rights watch warning of revenge attacks on sunnis in tikrit . add to this equation the fact that isis is made up sunni muslims who consider __shias__ __heretics__ and __apostates__ , slaughtering them in large numbers . civilians and troops alike have faced their wrath : the most glaring incident may have been last june , when the militant group overran an iraqi military base once known as camp __speicher__ -- which , notably , is near tikrit -- and claimed to kill some 1,600 air force cadets , the vast majority of them __shias__ . given these harsh realities , it 's not necessarily cut and dried what a sunni citizen in tikrit will think if either shia militias or the __shia-led__ iraqi military battle the sunni group isis . `` do i choose the iraqi military -lrb- which is working with the u.s.-led coalition -rrb- or isis ? do i choose leukemia or the plague ? ... which groups do they dislike more ? '' said stephen biddle , a strategy expert and the award-winning author of `` military power : explaining victory and defeat in modern battle . '' `` it 's not like the sunnis love isis ; most do n't . but some think the shiite government is a bigger threat than isis . '' so what should the united states do ? jessica stern , a lecturer on terrorism at harvard university who this month published , `` isis : the state of terror , '' says it 's imperative to address the sectarian divisions in iraq and continue pushing for changes in its government . she notes that `` the __anti-sunni__ , __shia-promoting__ government of maliki '' was a big reason isis was able `` to take root '' in iraq . `` many sunnis feel under siege . isis is saying , ` we 're going to protect you . isis is presenting itself as a savior of sunnis , '' she said . but , as biddle points out , reform in a bureaucracy comes slow . there 's been talk for years about healing iraq 's sectarian divide . what 's to say talk will translate into action anytime soon ? biddle thinks the u.s. should consider __sweetening__ the carrots offered to the iraqis as incentives -- and start carrying bigger sticks -- to spur it to get its act together . the biggest stick would be pulling out of the fight against isis . `` right now we seem to be limping along with whatever they do , '' he said . `` we 're not offering them many goodies to do what we want and not making them feel like they 're going to suffer much either if they do n't do what we want . '' enter iran . it 's part of this quandary because it shares a border with iraq , has its own interest in fending off isis , and is predominantly shia . it 's also a staunch foe of the united states , which its leaders have cast as the `` great satan . '' that lack of love is mutual , with washington leading a years-long standoff with tehran over its nuclear program . -lrb- there are ongoing talks aimed at resolving that impasse , but critically no deal yet . -rrb- . yet isis is likewise america 's enemy , with president barack obama saying that the goal is to `` degrade and ultimately destroy '' that group . it 's not in iran 's interest to have iraq devolve into a sectarian war , says retired u.s. air force lt. col. rick __francona__ , a cnn military analyst . `` the iranians are smart enough to know that 's a possibility , so they would be telling the __shia-led__ militias not to make this a sunni v. shia fight , '' __francona__ said . but what should the united states think about iran 's efforts to defeat isis by backing __shia-led__ militias ? speaking at a congressional hearing wednesday about the white house 's request for use of force to fight isis , the chairman of the u.s. joint chiefs of staff opined that iran 's involvement in helping iraqi forces is a good thing . `` anything anyone does to counter isis is in the main a good outcome , '' gen. martin dempsey said . defense secretary ashton carter suggested that the matter was more nuanced . the u.s. is worried about iran 's role , he said . `` it is something that is concerning to us , '' he said of iran 's role , `` in particular because the sectarian danger in iraq is the principal thing that can unravel the campaign against isis . '' cnn 's jomana karadsheh contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the world is watching for what could turn out to be either a historic achievement for international diplomacy -- or , just as easily , a disappointing failure -- as negotiators sit down this week in the tranquil lakeside city of lausanne , switzerland , to hammer out a framework nuclear deal with iran before march 31 . here are some of the key things you need to know as the next major deadline approaches in the iran nuclear talks : . 1 . the road to lausanne has been a long one . this latest round of talks are part of a process that has been going on for two years , through both public and private diplomatic channels . in 2013 , tensions between the world powers and iran began to thaw a bit after the election of reformist iranian president hassan rouhani , who pledged to end the crippling weight of international sanctions on iran 's economy . in november of that year , officials from the five permanent member nations of the u.n. security council -- the united states , united kingdom , france , russia and china -- along with germany , began nuclear negotiations with iranian officials in switzerland and signed what came to be known as the geneva agreement or joint plan of action , offering limited sanctions relief for iran in return for that country rolling back aspects of its nuclear program . the deal was heralded as an interim step toward a larger , more comprehensive agreement , which would further lessen the economic pressure on iran and give the six world powers -- referred to collectively as the p5 +1 -- certain assurances that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful in nature , as it claims . several rounds of talks have taken place since the joint plan of action was reached in an effort to bring about that comprehensive agreement . but this interim agreement has been extended twice over a failure of the parties to meet previous deadlines for a final deal . 2 . there 's no guarantee they 'll reach a deal . while both sides stand to gain from a potential agreement , they also have certain `` red lines '' they are n't willing to cross -- key issues that could sink the prospects of a deal even if everything else is agreed to . for iran , a major sticking point is the pace of sanctions relief . they want the international community to lift all u.n. sanctions at the beginning of the agreement , whereas the p5 +1 powers would rather see those sanctions phased out as iran demonstrates its commitment to the deal . iran also wants a high cap on the number of centrifuges and other nuclear hardware it can continue to operate , and for the restrictions imposed on it in the deal to last only a short period of time . this platform is __diametrically__ opposed to the p5 +1 position : that iran should maintain a relatively small nuclear infrastructure and that the moratorium on iran 's nuclear activities should last at least a decade . and of critical importance , particularly to the united states , is the insistence that iran be held to a minimum one-year `` breakout time '' -- a technical terms reflecting the amount of time it would take for iran to produce enough __fissile__ material for a nuclear weapon if it decides to walk away from the agreement . so even as negotiators express some optimism about the progression of talks , it 's clear that there are major gaps to bridge , which may be why some u.s. officials have put the odds of reaching a deal at 50 % or less . 3 . even if there 's a deal , it 's not the deal . while the focus this week is on the march 31 deadline , it 's important to note it is n't the final deadline . the parties are seeking to reach what 's being called a framework agreement -- essentially a political understanding of the main principles of the final deal . but if they 're able to come together on the big issues , they still have until the end of june when the joint plan of action expires to iron out the details . so that means the talks wo n't be finished this month . officials have been vague about the format this framework deal might take as well as how much of it will be made known to the public and international stakeholders . the united states would prefer a written accord , but iran has balked at putting anything in writing until a comprehensive deal is reached . 4 . there are a lot of stakeholders . there are seven countries at the negotiating table , but far more following along from the outside . israel , for instance , as one of iran 's primary geopolitical foes in the middle east , is watching the talks keenly . israeli officials are regularly consulting with their p5 +1 allies on a regular basis and are trying to influence the outcome of the deal . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has been one of the most vocal critics of the negotiation process , publicly __butting__ heads with the obama administration in an effort to derail the talks . saudi arabia 's government is equally concerned about the prospects of a deal , fearing it could give iran greater leverage in the region . and there are those who fear that a nuclear agreement will spur other countries in the region to develop nuclear programs -- a means of deterring iran if it decides to restart the military dimensions of its newly __legitimized__ nuclear program . but there are also stakeholders in the international community that would welcome the opportunity to trade freely with iran once sanctions are eased , giving them access to vast iranian markets . 5 . domestic politics matter . aside from netanyahu , many of iran 's most ardent detractors are in the u.s. congress and in iran , and they will continue to make their views known . the chairman of the influential senate foreign relations committee , sen. bob corker , __r-tennessee__ , is introducing legislation that would compel the administration to put any deal it reaches to a vote in congress , something that the administration adamantly opposes . administration officials say congress has already been consulted throughout the negotiating process , and that , at the end of any final agreement -lrb- potentially a decade from now -rrb- , will play a role in repealing u.s. unilateral sanctions . but congress is not satisfied to take a back seat in these talks -- a fact that was demonstrated this month when 47 republican senators signed a letter to the supreme leader of iran , suggesting a future president can easily retract any agreement the obama administration signs . in iran , supreme leader ayatollah khamenei has the final say on any nuclear agreement iran would reach with world powers . and he is mindful of hard-line clerics in iran who are opposed to a deal with the west that imposes restrictions on what they see as iran 's right to a nuclear program . khamenei has sent mixed messages about the negotiations . he has voiced support for the efforts of rouhani and foreign minister javad zarif , the lead negotiator . but he has continually voiced distrust for the united states and has dismissed the idea that a nuclear deal would lead to cooperation in other areas . the internal struggle between power centers in both the united states and iran is a key variable that could derail the already complicated negotiation process .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     interim deal from 2013 between six world powers and iran has been extended twice . parties are seeking a framework agreement -- or main principles of final deal -- by next week . seven countries are at negotiating table , but others such as israel follow from the outside .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- whoever wins the general election on may 7 will face international challenges reaching to the heart of a question that has __bedevilled__ every london government since 1945 : what is , or should be , britain 's role in the world ? as one of world war ii 's victor countries , britain helped shape the post-war international architecture . notably , it gained a permanent seat , plus veto power , in the u.n. security council , which it retains to this day . but these battlefield laurels disguised fundamental weakness . the two world wars severely depleted britain 's human and material resources . the heyday of the world 's __largest-ever__ empire and of london and liverpool 's control of a vast maritime trading network had passed . as the cold war took global grip , the united states purposefully pushed britain aside . the u.s. took over its military bases , its spheres of influence , and its markets . conscious of its decline , london clung , slightly __pathetically__ , to what it termed its `` special relationship '' with washington . maintaining this key u.s. relationship is the most important foreign policy challenge facing britain 's prime minister after may 7 . whether that person is the conservative party 's david cameron or the opposition labour party 's ed miliband makes no difference . barack obama 's arrival in the white house now looks like a watershed for bilateral relations . unlike many of his post-war predecessors , obama was no __anglophile__ . indeed , his grandfather 's unhappy experience in __colonial-era__ kenya gave him reason to dislike the english . obama the __dispassionate__ analyst also found scant objective reason to prioritize the british alliance or europe generally . looking at the eu , he saw one dominant , friendly power -- and its capital was berlin , not london . looking the other way , to asia , obama saw opportunities and threats of far greater moment , centered on rising powers such as china and india -- hence his subsequent `` tilt '' to asia . britain 's principal value to the u.s. lies with its defense capabilities . it proved a loyal if not especially effective ally in afghanistan and iraq . although capacity has steadily declined in the past 30 years , britain was seventh in the world in 2013 in terms of military spending and remains a dependable u.s. deputy within nato . but the pre-election consensus is that the next british government will be obliged to slash defense spending again , probably below the 2 % of gdp threshold to which nato members are pledged to maintain . big cuts in army and air force numbers are in prospect . maintaining even one modern aircraft carrier has become a real struggle . it is likely , on these trends , that britain would be unable to contribute separately to any new international campaign , but would be obliged to place its troops under u.s. command , as general raymond odierno , u.s. army chief of staff , recently suggested . america 's top politicians , soldiers and diplomats , such as u.n. ambassador samantha power , are applying increasing pressure on britain over defense expenditure , but with little joy so far . in time , this impasse could lead to a permanent rift . worse still , in the u.s. view , is the possibility that a __labour-led__ government , potentially beholden to the unilateral nuclear __disarmers__ of the scottish national party , could __slacken__ its commitment to trident , the uk 's nuclear missile submarine fleet . the snp says the country can no longer afford a nuclear deterrent , morally or financially . washington 's worries about britain 's role have been exacerbated by the lack of fight , as some see it , displayed by london when faced with the prospect of scottish independence and the inevitable break-up of the united kingdom . similar concerns apply to britain 's eu membership , which cameron has placed in doubt by promising a national referendum by 2017 . the u.s. greatly values britain as an informal , surrogate voice within the eu . but washington 's interests aside , the eu is britain 's biggest trading partner and a natural ally in terms of democratic values , and legal , social and cultural norms . an exit from the eu would satisfy minority hardline nationalists in the uk independence party . but it would seriously undermine britain 's standing in the world , in relation to europe and to the emerging brics powers . all this matters more than ever because , amid the developing disorder of the __post-cold__ war world , old __certainties__ are being uprooted and new or revived threats are multiplying . the aggressive behavior of vladimir putin 's russia is one obvious example . another is the rise of international terrorism , most recently in the form of isis , also known as the islamic state . another is china 's __hegemonic__ ambitions in the east china and south china seas , at the expense of neighbors such as japan , the philippines and vietnam . on these issues , it seems that britain , by design or not , has little concrete to contribute . london allowed germany and france to take the lead on ukraine diplomacy . embarrassed by public criticism , cameron belatedly sent a few army advisers to help train kiev 's forces . similarly , london 's military contribution to the fight against isis has been minimal , and confined to iraq . members of parliament recently expressed strong dismay that britain was doing so little . and as for japan , ostensibly an important british ally , recent defense cooperation agreements do not disguise the likely __infeasibility__ of __sharp-end__ assistance . indeed , as some see it , there is far too much british __kow-towing__ to china . disturbed by this evidence of decline , britain 's political class comforts itself by arguing the country still leads by example . it still maintains a generous overseas aid budget , it mounts successful humanitarian missions such as in sierra leone during the ebola outbreak , it remains a top five world economic power , and sometimes -lrb- though not always -rrb- it uses its u.n. and other platforms to stand up for democratic values and human rights . all this is true . but it is small consolation for a country that , 100 years ago , was a superpower with truly global reach . in the election campaign , foreign policy and the key 21st century international issues , such as climate change , have barely got a mention so far . this is not an accident . britain 's horizons are narrowing . its strength and global ambitions are fading . its __post-imperial__ destiny is that of a second-tier power . the trick is not to appear second rate .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     whoever wins may 7 election must answer this question , says simon __tisdall__ : what is , or should be , britain 's role in the world ? __tisdall__ : maintaining u.s. relationship is most important foreign policy challenge facing britain 's pm after may 7 . but foreign policy and key 21st century issues , such as climate change , have barely been mentioned , he writes .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- hillary clinton held a closed door meeting with president barack obama at the white house on monday . although the former secretary of state , senator and first lady has not declared , it is treated as a foregone conclusion that clinton is running for president . likely to launch her campaign in april , clinton is regarded as the front-runner -- if not the only democratic candidate -- and the inevitable democratic nominee . there is an assumption that since clinton supported obama , the black community will now embrace her . but there are more than a few who did n't get that memo . at this stage of the game , many african-americans may not be excited about a candidate hillary clinton in 2016 . and after two terms of the nation 's first black president , she should proceed with caution . clinton need look no further than the 2008 contest , when black voters doused water on her presidential prospects . early on , clinton was the favorite of black folks , lest you forgot , and it did not hurt that president clinton had been regarded as the `` first black president '' with high approval among african-americans . then , support for a senator named barack obama blew up after the iowa caucuses . and clinton found herself apologizing for her husband 's comments about obama 's win in the south carolina primary . president clinton was relieved of his black card privileges for the remainder of the 2008 election season when he compared obama 's win in the palmetto state to that of jesse jackson in 2004 and 2008 , suggesting that obama , like jackson , would not win . the misstep was an affront to many african-americans , as were hillary clinton 's suggestions on the campaign trail that obama was only good for making speeches , but not for taking action . and let 's not forget her assertions that she was the candidate for `` hard-working americans , white americans . '' we can chalk up some of that rhetoric to spirited __campaign-trail__ __junk-talking__ , and obviously much has happened since the 2008 election . president obama made clinton his secretary of state , and she served as a capable top diplomat and a loyal member of the obama cabinet . but that does not mean black voters will completely forget the bitter , racially tinged presidential campaign politics of seven years ago . black voters are among the most loyal of the democratic party base , and their record high turnout for obama was an important part of his victory . however , with a charismatic obama no longer on the ballot , maintaining the same level of enthusiasm for any other candidate is a challenge . __thegrio.com__ : blacks are treated 72 % as well as whites . moreover , as for clinton , who -lrb- understandably ? -rrb- has her own ideas and may not agree with the president on certain issues , any criticism of obama could cost her some black voters . remember that clinton voted in favor of the unpopular , costly and deadly iraq war . that support cost clinton in 2008 . and while she has remained silent on the recent re-election of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , clinton 's strongly pro-israel stance on mideast peace now appears at odds with the emerging consensus among major groups in the democratic base , including blacks , latinos and young voters . however , it is likely that foreign policy will not pose as great a challenge to hillary clinton as economics . because she is tied to the wall street wing of her party and commands sky-high speaking fees , people may take a closer look at her approach to tackling inequality and the shrinking of the middle class , and whether she is too concerned about offending the wealthy . the nation is hurting , despite the economic turnaround , and this is felt particularly strongly among blacks , who still have high unemployment rates , a rising wealth gap compared to whites , and , for many , no recovery in sight . and while police shootings of young black men continue to stir outrage in the community , clinton has remained relatively quiet on the subject . she will have to prove that she can identify with this frustration and offer ideas for reform in local law enforcement . this , rather than her email account , is what concerns the black electorate . __thegrio.com__ : let 's stop the ` struggle equation ' perhaps a populist , more down-to-earth challenger such as massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren or former virginia sen. jim webb could appeal to black and working-class voters , and unlike clinton , would not have to fight the perception of living in a protective security bubble , or lacking core beliefs other than being in power . it is safe to assume that if clinton wins the democratic nomination that she will ultimately win the majority black vote in the general election , but that may not be enough . let 's remember president george w. bush won re-election in 2004 with just 11 % of the black vote . had mitt romney been able to duplicate that number of black votes , he would be president now . obama won in no small part because blacks turned out for him in record numbers in 2012 , particularly in swing states like ohio . clinton ca n't assume she 'll inherit that same level of black voter enthusiasm . support for barack obama does not necessarily translate into support for another democrat . this means clinton must fight for votes like anyone else : knock on doors , kiss babies , clap off beat at the __ame__ church , and do whatever it takes .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- there is a controversy brewing about starbucks and its new `` race together '' campaign . the ubiquitous coffee shop company was mocked for its decision to have its employees write the words `` race together '' on its coffee cups and start a discussion on race . but what 's so bad about that ? should n't we commend starbucks for trying to be good corporate citizen , to walk the talk , as it were ? starbucks ceo howard schultz announced the company 's new campaign this week , which he described as `` an opportunity to begin to re-examine how we can create a more empathetic and inclusive society . '' in other words , grab a cup of coffee and let 's talk about race . `` we have problems in this country with regard to race and racial inequality , '' schultz said in a video to corporate employees . `` we believe we 're better than this , and we believe the country is better than this . there is a need for compassion , empathy and love towards others . '' and he has indicated that the new move is not mandatory for its employees . this is what schultz calls `` conscious capitalism . '' it is an example of businesses who want to serve the community , get ahead of the curve rather than pander to what they think customers want , and show that they care about something other than getting paid . __thegrio.com__ : __creflo__ dollar is further proof that prosperity gospel is full of ` false profits ' of course , we would be foolish to think that starbucks or any company would engage in such a strategy separate and apart from a profit motive . after all , the company , like any other money making enterprise , wants to make more money . and capitalism is all about making money . and yet , there are different pathways to getting there , and maybe starbucks is showing us a new way . perhaps you think that their approach is __corny__ , and yes , the company has faced a lot of attacks online for their stance . but the attacks are distracting us from a very important problem , one which many people would rather not discuss , with or without their coffee . clearly some people do want to talk about race , and there is a desperate need to confront the issue head on . what we are witnessing as a society is a new movement led by black women and spurred by the killing of black people such as michael brown and trayvon martin , renisha mcbride and eric garner , john crawford and tamir rice , and many more , whether by police or by armed vigilantes . __thegrio.com__ : blacks are treated 72 percent as well as whites . people of all colors and __persuasions__ have participated in __#blacklivesmatter__ , __#icantbreathe__ and __#handsupdontshoot__ protests and __die-ins__ across the nation . race is part of the town hall , the public square . it always has been , but what is different now is that the issue is once again being placed on the front burner . it only makes sense that actors and players in society , including corporations such as starbucks , would want to become part of that new dynamic . at a time when so many corporations are coming under fire for their questionable , exploitative , even deadly business practices , starbucks is trying to be a responsible corporate citizen and part of the solution . corporate america makes a great deal of money , and just as some corporations have benefited historically from slave labor and exploitation , some corporations today attempt to get ahead by cutting corners , __underpaying__ their workers with poverty wages , cheating their customers with bad mortgages or polluting the environment . meanwhile , other companies take a completely different approach and realize that by giving back to the community , supporting worthwhile causes , and initiating important discussions not only helps their bottom line , but improves society 's bottom line . of course , we can not pretend that having a talk about race over coffee will solve america 's problems , just as president obama 's `` beer summit '' over the racial profiling of harvard professor henry louis gates fell short of fully capitalizing on one of those `` __teachable__ moments . '' __thegrio.com__ : let 's stop the ` struggle equation ' race in the united states is not merely about who likes or who does n't like you , or who calls you the n-word or does not want to live next to you . racism is a system of power dynamics and institutions that must be made to change . but these institutions are made of people , and people do have to talk . and drink coffee . and who knows what can happen when people start to talk about race ? maybe they will even think about things in a different way . so , let 's not attack starbucks for doing the right thing and getting the ball rolling on race . the only thing worthy of criticism is that other companies have n't done it , and that 's something that needs to change . more : what starbucks ' __#racetogether__ campaign missed .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- __muhammadu__ __buhari__ has ruled nigeria before , as one of a line of military __strongmen__ who dominated the country between 1966 and 1999 . a military coup brought __buhari__ to power in late 1983 -- closing a brief period of popular rule by __shehu__ __shagari__ -- and another military coup ousted him from power in august 1985 . __buhari__ 's 20-month rule was known for what he described as a `` war on __indiscipline__ , '' a tough regime which some say was marred by human rights abuses . the 72-year-old retired major general 's experience as a military ruler has been viewed as a plus by some and a minus by others in present-day nigeria , where the government has been locked in a deadly battle with the militant group boko haram . this year alone , the extremists have killed at least 1,000 civilians , human rights watch says . the ongoing violence in the northeast has put security -- along with corruption and the economy -- at the top of the election agenda . prior to this year 's polls in march , __ayo__ johnson , a documentary filmmaker and analyst on african affairs , told cnn that voters would opt for whoever could make nigeria feel safe . `` many nigerians will not forget -lrb- __buhari__ -rrb- was a military leader , during a dictatorship , '' johnson said . `` or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism . '' __buhari__ has campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime , while stressing that nigeria 's security needs to be the next government 's focus . `` it 's a question of security . whether i was a former military officer or a politician through and through , when there is insecurity of this scale in the country , that takes the priority , '' he said from his campaign plane . in another interview with amanpour in february , __buhari__ blamed president goodluck jonathan 's government for repeated setbacks in the fight against extremists . `` the __misappropriation__ of resources provided by the government for weapons means the nigerian military is unable to beat boko haram , '' he said . asked by amanpour about abuses allegedly committed during his own previous leadership , __buhari__ said there was `` a degree of accuracy '' in the claims . but he said he had ruled nigeria as part of a military administration . `` when that military administration came under my leadership , we suspended -- as a military then -- part of that constitution that we felt would be difficult for us to operate and as also a consensus , '' he said . `` i think i 'm being judged harshly as an individual that what happened during a military administration can be extended under a __multiparty__ democratic system . '' __buhari__ 's campaign was fiercely anti-corruption . he ran under the slogan of `` new broom , '' and his supporters were often pictured holding __brooms__ in the lead-up to the vote . the 2015 presidential race was __buhari__ 's fourth attempt at leadership since he was ousted from power in 1985 . in 2003 , __buhari__ -- then with the all nigeria people 's party -- lost to __olusegun__ __obasanjo__ in an election during which eu observers reported widespread irregularities . he lost again to __umaru__ yar ` adua in the 2007 election , which was widely condemned for rampant vote-rigging , violence , theft of ballot boxes and intimidation . after yar ` adua 's death in 2010 , jonathan rose from vice president to president and __buhari__ challenged him in the 2011 elections as a candidate from the congress for progressive change . __buhari__ had helped found the party a year earlier , saying it was `` a solution to the debilitating , ethical and ideological conflicts in my former party , the __anpp__ . '' __buhari__ is a muslim from nigeria 's poorer north , while jonathan hails from a christian and __animist__ south that is rich with oil . after jonathan 's victory in 2011 , amid accusations of vote-rigging , violent riots broke out in the north . armed protesters took to the streets chanting __buhari__ 's name , and more than 800 people were killed in the post-election violence . __buhari__ 's office issued a statement calling reports of burning of places of worship places a `` sad , unfortunate and totally unwarranted development . '' `` i must say that this is a dastardly act -lrb- that -rrb- is not initiated by any of our supporters and therefore can not be supported by our party , '' said __buhari__ 's spokesman __yinka__ __odumakin__ . `` i must emphasize that this is purely a political matter , and it should not in any way be turned into an ethnic , religious or regional one . '' read more : nigeria election -- what you need to know . ahead of this year 's election , jonathan and __buhari__ signed a nonviolence pact , the abuja accord , in january . on march 26 they renewed their pledge and reiterated their commitment to `` free , fair and credible elections . '' but violent protests broke out a day before the final results were announced . protesters fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in nigeria 's oil-rich rivers state as they marched to protest the elections , amid claims of vote-rigging and voter intimidation . both candidates called for calm , with __buhari__ , who contested this year 's vote as part of the all progressives congress , tweeting : `` fellow nigerians , i urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced . '' after the protests in rivers , his party demanded the elections there be canceled . but nigeria 's electoral commission decided the results would stand , saying it `` did not believe the allegations were substantial enough to require the __cancellation/rescheduling__ '' of the rivers poll . according to his campaign website , __buhari__ is from __daura__ in nigeria 's northern __katsina__ state and is married with eight children . his military training began in 1963 and included stints in the united kingdom , india and the united states . __buhari__ was the first chairman of the nigerian petroleum corporation , the site says . elements of __buhari__ 's biography were questioned in the run-up to the march 28 election . after weeks of speculation and an ongoing legal battle over allegations that __buhari__ failed to complete his secondary school education , a nigerian court on march 25 cleared the way for him to run in the presidential race after adjourning the case until april 22 . as a sunni muslim from the north , __buhari__ appears to have moved to address any concerns his appointment could be detrimental to non-muslim nigerians -- approximately half the country 's population , according to the cia factbook . a blog post on his campaign website headed `` __buhari__ will never __islamise__ nigeria '' describes a campaign ceremony in january in __imo__ state . __imo__ gov. __rochas__ __okorocha__ , it says , `` dismissed suggestions of plans by __muhammadu__ __buhari__ to ` __islamize__ ' nigeria , '' telling the audience __buhari__ 's long-time cook and driver were christians and his youngest daughter had married a christian . __buhari__ has also not been immune to the violence plaguing northern nigeria . last year , he was targeted in a suicide bombing that killed at least 15 people in the city of __kaduna__ . an earlier blast in the city the same day had been aimed at a muslim cleric . a day after winning the country 's presidency , __buhari__ told cnn 's christiane amanpour that fighting corruption and curbing violence were at the top of his agenda . the economy is another major issue the new leader has to contend with , as the country overtook south africa last year as the continent 's largest economy . but as many as 70 % of nigerians live below the poverty line , surviving on less than a dollar a day .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     __muhammadu__ __buhari__ is a 72-year-old retired major general from __daura__ , northern nigeria . __buhari__ led nigeria from 1983 to 1985 , coming to power and leaving power through coups . against a backdrop of violence in the north , he has vowed to make security a priority .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- vladimir putin lies . blatantly . publicly . and , apparently , without chagrin . but a year since the annexation of crimea , what does that mean for the west 's ability to deal with him regarding ukraine ? in february 2014 , `` little green men '' -- the ukrainian term for professional soldiers wearing russian combat fatigues but no identifying insignia -- seized key installations and checkpoints around crimea . the russian president 's website reported the following exchange at a march 4 , 2014 , news conference : . question : `` the people who were blocking the ukrainian army units in crimea were wearing uniforms that strongly resembled the russian army uniform . were those russian soldiers , russian military ? '' vladimir putin : `` why do n't you take a look at the post-soviet states ? there are many uniforms there that are similar . you can go to a store and buy any kind of uniform . '' question : `` but were they russian soldiers or not ? '' vladimir putin : `` those were local self-defense units . '' within weeks , putin admitted they were russian troops . at the same news conference , putin said he saw no possibility of crimea joining russia and said moscow would do nothing to `` provoke '' that . two weeks later , he presided as the russian parliament passed legislation annexing crimea . in a documentary shown on russian television last sunday , putin said he gave the order to take crimea on february 23 , 2014 . so , it is clear that putin can and does lie . but with that in mind , how should western leaders who must deal with him actually do so ? first of all , they should bear in mind ronald reagan 's `` trust but verify '' __dictum__ . second , while putin may play fast and loose with the truth , he appears to be a rational actor who calculates costs and benefits . the challenge for the west is to structure agreements so that it remains in his interest to observe them . take the 2010 new strategic arms reduction treaty , which limits u.s. and russian strategic forces to no more than 1,550 deployed strategic warheads on 700 deployed missiles and bombers . the agreement requires data exchanges , notifications and on-site inspections . the russians might be able to cheat a little , but not in a way that would give them a militarily significant edge without the united states having time to react . and the kremlin has incentives to observe the treaty . if russia violated it , the united states could relatively quickly add 1,000 strategic nuclear warheads to its deployed ballistic missile force . the u.s. government concluded last summer that russia violated a 1987 treaty by testing a banned __intermediate-range__ __ground-launched__ cruise missile . as far as is publicly known , moscow has not taken the more serious step of deploying the missile . washington now seeks to persuade russia to come back into full compliance and has threatened a variety of costs , including possible military countermeasures -- on top of the __opprobrium__ of russia 's european and asian neighbors , who would be targeted by such a missile . -lrb- it could reach little , if any , of the united states . -rrb- the costs of __noncompliance__ for moscow could be significant . the question now topping the agenda is whether the west can trust any russian promises regarding a settlement to the conflict in eastern ukraine . sadly , the track record offers little encouragement . russia effectively did nothing to implement the first minsk ceasefire , which was agreed to last september . it did not withdraw its military equipment or secure the __ukraine-russia__ border . the minsk ii ceasefire reached in february fared little better at the outset . a kremlin spokesman dismissed the idea that russia was a party to the agreement -- even though russia 's ambassador signed it . russian forces backed those of the separatists attacking the ukrainian town of debaltseve in the first days after the ceasefire supposedly had begun . -lrb- putin 's continual denials that russian troops are in eastern ukraine have zero credibility after the crimea case . -rrb- . since then , the ceasefire seems to have taken better hold , though it remains fragile at best . at the same time , concern has grown that the port city of mariupol could be the next __separatist/russian__ target . what can the west do to stabilize the ceasefire ? an assault on mariupol -lrb- or elsewhere in eastern ukraine -rrb- would probably trigger severe costs in the form of a new round of western economic sanctions on russia and the provision to ukraine of greater military assistance , including defensive arms . as hans __binnendijk__ and john __herbst__ recently suggested in the new york times , the united states and european union should tell the russians now what costs would be imposed if there is an assault on mariupol , in order to help deter such an attack . the west may not be able to trust putin on the ceasefire in eastern ukraine . but it can do more to raise the potential costs and affect his calculation , and hopefully dissuade him from further military action that would probably bring down the entire minsk ii agreement .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- fifa president sepp blatter has told iran to end its `` intolerable '' ban on women attending football matches . writing in the fifa weekly magazine published by world football 's governing body , blatter described the situation as one that `` can not continue . '' iran 's ban was put in the spotlight at the asian cup in australia earlier this year , when thousands of female iranian fans watched their team without restriction . at the match against iraq , activists unfurled a banner showing the face of __ghoncheh__ ghavami , a __british-iranian__ woman jailed for trying to watch a volleyball match against brazil in 2014 , and called for the ban to end . the measure was imposed following the 1979 islamic revolution because the idea of mixed crowds was deemed un-islamic . iran is in the running to host the 2019 edition of the asian tournament , for which the united arab emirates is also bidding . but the ban is widely expected to scupper its chances of securing the event . blatter wrote : `` i raised the topic at my meeting with the president of iran , hassan rouhani , and came away with the impression that this intolerable situation could change over the medium term . `` however , nothing has happened . a collective stadium ban still applies to women in iran , despite the existence of a thriving women 's football organization . `` this can not continue . hence my appeal to the iranian authorities -- open the nation 's football stadiums to women . '' during last year 's football world cup , cnn reported how fans in iran gathered to watch games in venues that defied a ban on public screenings . at one coffee shop in the capital , tehran , the tense game against argentina -- a game iran lost only to an injury-time lionel messi goal -- was watched by a large mixed crowd . `` 100 percent it 's better this way , '' said __negar__ __valayi__ . `` it does n't happen often . it would be great if we have more of this . '' `` it 's actually much better to watch it with a bunch of people around because it makes you feel more excited , '' said __roya__ __marzbahan__ . hoardings advertising the world cup throughout tehran that summer had featured no pictures of women . and state tv broadcasts of matches employed a delay of several seconds in order for images of female fans deemed too racy to be censored . blatter also hit out at football 's continental confederations for failing to elect any women onto governing body 's executive committee . the committee includes three women -- one of whom has voting rights and two of whom are __co-opted__ -- but they are elected directly by the fifa congress following a change to the statutes in 2011 . `` this was hard work because the members of fifa 's executive committee are elected by the national associations ... and there was never , never a proposal for a woman to be finally in fifa , '' the 78-year-old said at an event in switzerland . `` we had to take the decision , and i did it in 2011 at the end of the congress , -lsb- that -rsb- we must have at least one woman on the executive committee . '' he described football as a `` macho '' sport and warned : `` we should change in the future . ''

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- team cookie or team boo boo kitty ? if you 're a fan of the hit tv show `` empire , '' you will totally get that reference to one of the main rivalries on the series . if you are n't a fan , you may soon be in the minority . the show has become something of an industry phenomenon , with ratings growing every week . according to variety , two weeks before the season finale , which is set to air on march 18 , ratings were up 53 % from its january 7 premiere in the coveted 18-49 demo and total viewership had risen 45 % , from 9.9 million to 14.3 million . eight straight weeks of growth is almost __unheard-of__ these days in broadcast tv , which has faced fierce competition from cable and streaming services . but fox 's `` empire '' is doing the damn thing . the show revolves around the character of record label owner __lucious__ lyon -lrb- played by terence howard -rrb- and his family , which includes three sons vying to take over his company and an ex-wife who took the fall for him and returns from prison intent on getting what 's hers . `` you 're so beautiful , '' empire , and here are some of the reasons why : . __taraji__ p. henson . henson has been in the industry for a minute , and despite critically acclaimed roles in films like `` hustle & flow '' and `` the curious case of benjamin button '' -lrb- the latter of which earned her a best supporting actress oscar nomination -rrb- , her career had n't really taken off . not so now . henson has sunk her teeth into the role of lyon family matriarch cookie . the character is hard-core and street smart and loves her family fiercely , even as she is also motivated by making money . the show 's co-creator , danny strong , told entertainment weekly that fans can thank henson for the now infamous `` boo boo kitty '' nickname that viewers have come to love . when cookie __sneeringly__ calls her ex-husband __lucious__ ' new lady love , __anika__ calhoun -lrb- played by grace __gealey__ -rrb- , `` boo boo kitty , '' you want to yell at the screen , `` get her , cookie ! '' `` so , basically __taraji__ is a genius , '' strong said . `` she 's a comic genius , but she 's also an incredibly powerful dramatic actress , and we 're utilizing all that in cookie . '' watch for henson to snag nominations next award season . it 's old school __soapy__ . think `` dynasty '' and `` dallas '' for the 21st century . it has all the things that make prime-time soaps so delicious : sex , scores to settle , family tensions , violence and did we mention sex ? set in the world of the music industry , there is plenty of glitz and glamor that is balanced with some seedy , dark underworld shenanigans to keep the plot moving at a pace that has viewers eagerly awaiting the next episode . that 's a feat given how so many audiences have gotten used to being able to binge watch to scratch that `` and then what ? '' itch . it 's __new-school__ hip . `` empire '' has fully embraced everything that makes a modern drama modern . one of the primary story lines has been about homophobia , as __lucious__ lyon and his son jamal -lrb- __jussie__ __smollett__ -rrb- battle over jamal revealing he 's gay . it comes amid tons of conversation in this country about gay rights . series co-creator lee daniels , himself an openly gay man , has said he wants to expose the problem of homophobia in the black community . `` homophobia is rampant in the african-american community , and men are on the __dl__ -lrb- down low , meaning living a double life and sleeping with both men and women -rrb- . they do n't come out , because your priest says , your pastor says , mama says , your next-door neighbor says , your __homie__ says , your brother says , your boss says -lrb- that homosexuality is wrong -rrb- , '' the wrap reported daniels saying during the television critics association press tour in january . `` and they are killing african-american women . they are killing our women . so i wanted to blow the lid off more on homophobia in my community . '' the music is off the hook . the show has managed to improve on what `` glee '' did and succeed at what the __now-canceled__ nbc drama `` smash '' tried to do : fully incorporate music into the show and cross over to the actual music industry . __smollett__ has been the breakout star in this area . his mellow voice has carried some of the soundtrack 's more popular tunes , including the anthem to individuality , `` good enough , '' which has more than 1 million listens on the streaming music service spotify . __superproducer__ __timbaland__ -lrb- best known for work with artists including jay z and justin timberlake -rrb- and his __protegee__ jim __beanz__ are responsible for the show 's sound . __beanz__ told rolling stone the music has to be authentic and original . `` one of the things that tim told me is , ` if it sounds like something you 've heard before , do n't do it , ' '' he said . of course the show has cashed in on the songs by making them available on itunes . fingers crossed for a possible `` empire '' tour featuring __smollett__ and other co-stars including __bryshere__ __y.__ gray , who portrays youngest lyon son __hakeem__ and who in real life raps under the moniker __yazz__ the greatest . the awesome guest appearances . you could have knocked us over with a feather when courtney love popped up on the show . love had a bit role on this first season , as has supermodel naomi campbell and '80s actor judd nelson . the series has been __hyping__ appearances from music stars like jennifer hudson , mary j. blige and patti labelle . given the popularity of the show , there 's no telling who will pop up on season 2 . henson and howard . the __love/hate__ relationship between cookie and __lucious__ lyon is everything . they have heat and many fans are rooting for the fictitious couple to reunite . chalk it up to the longtime friendship between henson and howard , who also co-starred in the film `` hustle and flow . '' howard told __blacktree__ tv that he and henson had to do a `` chemistry read '' to show that they clicked . the end result has been magical . `` we have so much fun , '' howard said .

ARTICEL:     washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- updates on scott walker , marco rubio and john kasich , an economic twist on the old adage `` all politics is local , '' and an overseas vote where president obama would love to see an __anti-incumbent__ backlash -- those stories filled our sunday trip around the `` inside politics '' table . the official white house line will be something like this : the israeli people are making their choice , the united states admires their vibrant democracy and looks forward to a close friendship and strategic partnership with the next israeli government no matter who wins . but it 's no secret president obama is no fan of benjamin netanyahu , and the israeli prime minister 's recent address to a joint meeting of the congress exposed the __rawness__ of the relationship . so as the votes are counted and the coalitions debated in the week ahead , the white house has both a personal and professional interest . npr 's steve __inskeep__ took a firsthand look at the israeli campaign in the final days and offered his take on the uncertainty . `` now , israel 's political system is so complicated that even if -lrb- netanyahu 's -rrb- party ends up not being the leading party , there are scenarios where he could end up in a governing coalition , '' said __inskeep__ . `` but it 's interesting to note that isaac herzog , the labor party leader , who 's his biggest challenger , wants to change israel 's approach to the world -- has been talking about trying to end israel 's isolation in the world , which would suggest changing a lot of policies that have infuriated this white house or frustrated this white house over the last several years . '' wisconsin gov. scott walker and former florida gov. jeb bush tend to be at the top of gop presidential polls these days , and a good deal has been written of late about a growing rivalry . but maggie __haberman__ of the new york times took us inside some recent big-money conversations during which walker took a more diplomatic approach when asked about his potential nomination rival . walker was in new york city last week for fund-raising meet and greets , and he met with some hedge fund executives who were very impressed by him . new york observer owner jared kushner was also on hand . `` he was asked how he would beat jeb bush , and he surprised a bunch of people by saying jeb bush is the front-runner , '' said __haberman__ . `` now , that 's contrary to a lot of other things he said publicly last week . '' `` but that is his sell to people who could give him money , which is : ` no , no , -lrb- bush -rrb- is the front-runner but i 'm the slow and steady guy who 's going to come up behind , just like when i ran track when i was younger . ' '' sen. marco rubio of florida at times appears to be the odd man out in the early gop presidential rankings . jeb bush 's aggressive entry into the race raised some questions about whether there would still be space for rubio to tap florida 's deep fund-raising well . then came the scott walker __boomlet__ , and talk among some conservatives that the wisconsin governor -- not rubio -- might be the best pick for a new generation gop __standard-bearer__ . but rubio has continued to build his team and travel to the early states on the nomination calendar , and robert costa of the washington post shared news of a developing relationship between the senator and the party 's 2012 nominee , mitt romney . `` he 's spoken with romney twice since romney decided not to get in the race , '' said costa . `` and he has had meetings this week with people like __lanhee__ chen , romney 's former policy director , and texts often with spencer __zwick__ , romney 's former finance director . '' `` i think rubio , if he __nurtures__ those relationships , we 'll see him continue to rise in the donor community and with consultants and voters . '' ohio gov. john kasich is about to make his first new hampshire foray of the 2016 cycle and is getting some encouragement from important players in the __first-in-the-nation__ primary state . kasich , who is exploring running but has n't been as aggressive as many other __gopers__ in terms of travel and staff recruitment , will be in new hampshire on march 24 for the politics and eggs breakfast , a rite of presidential passage sponsored by the new hampshire institute of politics . word from people familiar with the trip is that kasich is being encouraged to be more active in new hampshire by former gov. john h. __sununu__ and his son , former gop sen. john __sununu__ . two new hampshire gop activists also report that former gop sen. judd gregg also believes kasich -- like gregg , a budget hawk during his time in congress -- would be a strong addition to the gop field . there is a crowded field of republicans testing the waters for 2016 -- and the people of iowa , new hampshire and south carolina are grateful . they do n't have as much reason to be grateful to the democrats , who so far seem to be fixated on a single candidate . the lack of a big field will likely spare hillary clinton a damaging mess , as california gov. jerry brown suggested last week . but , party loyalties aside , perhaps he would have a different take if his state were near the top of the nominating calendar . julie pace of the associated press reminded us the early presidential attention is an economic engine in those early states . `` when you have robust primaries in both parties , you have tons of money flooding into iowa and new hampshire , south carolina , on television ads , on hotels , transportation , campaign headquarters , '' said pace . `` and there is some concern that on the democratic side , we 're just simply not going to see that this time around . '' `` and it 's a reminder that politics has become such a big business beyond just the campaigns and the super pacs . ''

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- two extremists who attacked a landmark museum in tunisia , killing 23 people , got weapons training at camps in libya , an official said friday . the suspects were activated from sleeper cells in tunisia , security minister rafik __chelly__ said . he did not say which group activated them , or with whom they trained . `` they left the country illegally last december for libya , and they were able to train with weapons there , '' he told private broadcaster __alhiwar__ __ettounsi__ tv . like tunisia , libya saw its longtime leader moammar gadhafi ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the arab spring . but unlike its neighbor to the west , libya has been fraught with more instability and violence -- much of it perpetrated by islamist militants , like those behind the 2012 benghazi attack that killed u.s. ambassador chris stevens and three other americans . such violence has been rare in tunisia , at least on the scale of what happened wednesday at the __bardo__ museum in tunis . still , it is not a total shock , given that up to 3,000 tunisians have left to fight as jihadists in iraq and syria , according to the international centre for the study of radicalization in london , not to mention others who have joined radical groups closer to home . already , authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack , including four directly linked to it , according to a statement from tunisian president __beji__ __caid__ __essebsi__ . and in an audio message posted online thursday , isis claimed responsibility for the attack , which it said targeted `` crusaders and __apostates__ '' with `` automatic weapons and hand grenades . '' cnn can not independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement . that bloodshed is `` just the start , '' the isis message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow , but nonetheless adds extra urgency for tunisian investigators . the nation 's security forces are working to break up other cells like those behind the recent __bardo__ museum attack . but that 's not necessarily going to be fast or easy . `` we know they can launch operations , but we must piece together clues in order to conduct an arrest , '' __chelly__ said . as investigators continued their work , tunisians turned out friday to mark the north african nation 's independence from france . those commemorations were more somber this year , but they were also in many ways more significant . `` i 'm here to celebrate 59 years of our independence , '' said __adib__ __adela__ , 38 , a school inspector in tunis . `` the most important thing now is to properly investigate and to find those responsible . '' tunisia has been shaken by the terrorist attack , though it was foreigners -- 19 of them tourists who 'd been on two cruise ships that docked in tunis -- who made up the vast majority of victims . fifteen victims ' bodies are at a morgue in the capital , a forensic official said . some of them have n't been identified two days after the attack , according to the official , and all are foreigners . the fear is that many other tourists wo n't come back . already , the parent companies of the two ships that had most of the victims , costa cruises and msc cruises , have announced the cancellation of all scheduled stops in tunis for 2015 and substituted them with other ports . that means some foreigners wo n't be coming to tunisia as once expected . but it does n't mean all tourists will stay away -- as illustrated by a movement online of people vowing , `` i will come to tunisia . '' beyond tourism , tunisians also hope to get support from other countries as they fight terrorism . `` i hope other countries will support tunisia , like they supported france after charlie hebdo , '' said amir __foudieli__ , 33 , who works for an export company , referring to the january massacre at the satirical magazine 's offices in paris . `` we are tunisian , this is our country . not theirs , they -lrb- the terrorists -rrb- are bastards of children . we have centuries of history .

'' in his letter , published monday in the free press , barnett said the city 's recent achievements are anything but provincial . `` our school district is one of the top performing in the state and boasts two blue ribbon schools , the most in michigan . our universities are among the fastest growing in the midwest and are rich with cultural and ethnic diversity , '' he wrote . buying madonna 's house : a tale of fame and misfortune . `` we design and build more robots than any other city in north america , and rochester hills residents and businesses have been granted over 900 patents , nearly one a day , over the last three years . not a typical achievement you would associate with ` simple or basic ' people , '' he wrote . he also noted the city was also named one of the 10 best places to live by money magazine . `` we are many things , madonna , but basic and provincial minded we are not !

'' twitter user __itsleah__ wrote . `` it is basic . i thought that was the appeal ? small towns are n't for everyone , dummies . '' of course , madonna is no stranger to controversy , and she 's angered organizations a lot bigger and more powerful than rochester city hall . remember the 1980s , when her `` like a prayer '' video angered the catholic church ? or the 1990s , when it seemed a camera could n't turn her direction without capturing simulated masturbation ? then there was last year , when she had to backtrack after posting an instagram photo of her son boxing , captioned with a take on the n-word . and in january , some took offense after she posted photos of civil rights icons altered to appear like the cover of her new album . heck , this is n't even the the first time the singer has __dissed__ a place where she grew up . in a 1987 interview with jane pauley , she called bay city , michigan , where she was born , a `` little smelly town in northern michigan .

ARTICEL:     leicester , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- `` god save king richard ! '' a cry rings out in the bright spring air as the simple oak coffin of richard iii is carried away from the tower __block-filled__ campus of the university of leicester for the final time . the medieval monarch 's skeleton has been kept at the university since its discovery beneath a council car parking lot in the city sparked excitement around the world in august 2012 . but on sunday the bones -- which have been studied by archaeologists and experts from all fields in the years since -- ended their tenure as scientific specimens and became , once more , the mortal remains of a king . some 35,000 people lined the streets of leicester and the surrounding towns and villages as the cortege wound its way through the countryside to the site of richard 's final battle , bosworth , where he died in 1485 , before returning to the city for a commemoration at leicester cathedral . the day began on the __freshly-mown__ lawns in front of the university 's fielding johnson building , where a crowd gathered for a solemn service of farewell , dignitaries dressed in their sunday best alongside students and local families clad in jeans and waterproof jackets in case of a march shower . leicester university student anna boyer , from north carolina , said she and her classmates had come to watch the ceremony `` so i can say i was here , '' adding : `` it 's an important historical event -- we do n't have things like this in the states . '' leicester alumni sara and __leeroy__ __paskell__ brought their daughters __saoirse__ , 6 , and __orlaith__ , 9 , to watch the cortege pass by . `` we thought it would be nice for the children to see it , '' said sara __paskell__ . `` it is amazing to be part of history , it makes me really proud of the university and of leicester . '' that pride is something which those who helped in the search for richard iii share . leicester university 's president and vice-chancellor paul boyle said the discovery of the bones had been a `` defining moment '' which `` reshaped history , '' and pointed out that the university had been custodian of richard iii 's remains for longer than he ruled england . genetics expert __turi__ king , who proved the identity of the bones by matching their dna to a living relative of the monarch , michael __ibsen__ , said : `` it has been an amazing project to be part of -- we all feel very privileged to be involved . '' king , who read robert frost 's poem `` the road not taken '' at the university service and laid a white rose -- a reminder of richard 's heritage as a member of the house of york -- on the coffin , said she considered the commemorations the end of a chapter in his story , but not the end of the story itself ; she is still working to sequence his entire genome . michael __ibsen__ and another living relative of richard iii , wendy __duldig__ , were there as the hearse carrying the coffin pulled away from the somber __grey-brown__ bricks of the fielding johnson building ; accompanied by archaeologist richard buckley , who led the dig which uncovered the king 's bones , they walked silently behind as the cortege 's journey began . thousands of people lined the route of the procession , out through the leicestershire villages visited by richard iii on his way to the battle of bosworth . perched on __fold-up__ picnic chairs they gathered on roadside verges , along pavements decorated with bunting , flags and paper chains of white __yorkist__ roses , and in pub car parks to be entertained by folk dancers as they waited for the coffin to pass by . at fenn lane farm , thought to be the closest location to the spot where richard iii died , earth from three key points in his life was placed in a casket carved with his symbol , a boar . the casket , and the procession , then made their way to bosworth , where they were greeted by men dressed in medieval armor . here , richard 's role as a `` warrior king '' was commemorated and tributes were paid to the others who died fighting alongside him . a beacon , which will burn until he is laid to rest on thursday , was lit on the battlefield . back in leicester , thousands more gathered around the cathedral and in nearby jubilee square . waiting to go in to the service , judy ellis , from the nearby town of hinckley , said there was a `` real buzz '' around the city . `` it 's quite exciting , coming over on the train i met people who 'd come from all over the world to be in leicester today . '' ellis , who named her son richard , said she had used the parking lot where the king 's remains were found . `` four days before the dig started i parked my car over that grave ! '' she said . adults -- some carrying single white roses and others wearing boar badges -- in village churches along the route watched the services play out on a big screen as children ran around in the late afternoon sunshine while they waited for richard 's return . in 1485 , the defeated king 's body was treated with little sense of occasion . it is said to have been slung naked over a horse and taken to leicester , where it was put on display for three days before being hurriedly crammed into a __too-small__ plot in the grey friars church . more than five centuries on , those who sparked the search for richard iii 's remains were determined to put right that ancient wrong by giving him a more fitting farewell . philippa langley , who led the `` looking for richard '' project , said its aim was `` to give richard what he did n't get in 1485 ... to recognize what went on in the past , but not repeat it , to make peace with the past . '' to that end , the king 's skeleton is to be given two things it did not have before : a coffin and proper burial rites . the coffin is a simple affair : english oak and yew , made by richard 's relative michael __ibsen__ who , as chance would have it , is a cabinet maker by trade ; it is carved with the king 's name and a white rose . the burial rites are somewhat more complicated : they have entailed the rebuilding of parts of leicester 's cathedral , a guest list numbering into the thousands and delicate questions of location and religion . but with those puzzles overcome , the first of several high profile __pre-reinterment__ services was held sunday evening : the coffin was carried through the city on a gun carriage , accompanied by two `` knights '' in full suits of armor , riding on horseback , to the cathedral . those who had gathered to pay tribute to richard iii threw roses into the procession 's path as it passed the new visitor center which has been built over his original resting place . as the city 's church bells __tolled__ and dusk began to fall , the coffin was lifted onto the shoulders of the pallbearers and taken into the cathedral , accompanied by four official `` mourners '' -- descendants of some of those who fought with richard at bosworth . once inside , it was covered with a __heavily-embroidered__ cloth , and a bible and __specially-commissioned__ crown were laid atop the casket , the latter by a local brownie , 9-year-old emma chamberlain , whose height meant a step had to be placed next to the coffin to allow her to reach it . in his sermon , the archbishop of westminster , cardinal vincent nichols alluded to richard iii 's controversial reputation and `` tumultuous life , '' which had seen moments of `` astonishing brutality . '' nichols said the king 's short reign was `` marked by unrest and the fatal __seepage__ of loyalty and support '' but insisted that he was also `` a man of prayer , a man of anxious devotion '' and one who had done good for his people . as those who had attended filed back out into the darkening spring evening , one final illuminated tribute was paid : the initials __riii__ and a crown were projected onto the cathedral 's tower , while nearby , white roses surrounded a statue of the king . as she left the service , victoria mckeown , who won a ticket to the event , said the experience had been `` brilliant '' and the memorial `` absolutely lovely . '' `` it 's a lovely way to spend a sunday evening -- not like being at home doing the ironing , '' she told cnn . `` it 's part of history : i can say ` i 've been to a king 's funeral . ' ''

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- as the seventh full week of testimony in the first-degree murder trial against former new england patriots star aaron hernandez came to a close this week , witnesses described him as acting strangely and glaring at the victim two nights before the killing . hernandez is on trial in fall river , massachusetts , in connection with the shooting death of odin lloyd , a semi-pro football player who was found dead june 17 , 2013 . the former tight end had signed a five-year contract extension worth $ 40 million but , less than a year later , hernandez was charged with the murder of the man who was dating the sister of his fiancée . hours after his arrest on june 26 , 2013 , the patriots dropped him from the team . two of hernandez 's closest associates are co-defendants in the case . evidence collected in lloyd 's death led to two more murder charges against hernandez in a separate case in boston . he is accused of shooting daniel de abreu and __safiro__ furtado in july 2012 , allegedly over a spilled drink . two witnesses who saw hernandez at the boston nightclub rumor just 48 hours before lloyd 's killing said he looked angry and aggressive . lloyd was with hernandez at the club that friday night . on thursday , prosecutors called witness no. 100 : kasey __arma__ , a nightclub promoter . she told jurors she danced with aaron hernandez at the club in the early morning of june 15 , 2013 . hernandez approached her . `` he walked by me and he tapped my hip . '' __arma__ testified that she danced with hernandez for about 10 minutes . `` he was pleasant and kind of charming , '' she said . then he left abruptly . when he returned about 10 minutes later , __arma__ said , hernandez grabbed her arm and took her to another part of the club . his demeanor changed . he was `` very aggressive , '' she testified . then , she said , he asked her `` to show what i could do with that thing , '' referring to her backside . `` he was irritated and very aggressive , '' she told the jury . during cross-examination , defense attorney michael fee showed surveillance video of __arma__ dancing with hernandez . there was bumping and grinding , mostly with her backside to him . it was uncomfortable to watch in court . jurors watched the video with laser focus . fee asked __arma__ , `` what kind of dance is that called ? '' __arma__ said she did n't know . some of the female jurors appeared to chuckle softly . earlier in the week , witness __kwami__ nicholas testified that he also saw hernandez at rumor and the __ex-player__ `` seemed like he was angry about something . '' hernandez 's mouth looked like a `` __grunt__ , '' he said . nicholas , a college student , was at the club with friends -- some of whom were friends with lloyd . when lloyd was talking closely with one of his friends , hernandez looked angry , according to nicholas . hernandez was standing near the dj at the time , about 15 feet away from lloyd and his friend . nicholas said hernandez __glared__ at them for a few minutes . during tough questioning from fee , nicholas stood his ground . the defense showed jurors nicholas ' initial recorded interview with detectives in which he gave a different description of what he saw and was less critical of hernandez . nicholas also remembered hernandez `` storming out of the club . '' `` he looked angry , '' nicholas told the jury . as hernandez walked down the street , `` he __motioned__ back with his arms as if to say get away from me . '' prosecutors played surveillance video backing up nicholas ' description . during that video , lloyd is also seen following hernandez at a distance . though prosecutors are trying to establish that hernandez was angry , jurors still do n't know why . shayanna jenkins , hernandez 's fiancée and mother of his baby daughter , was not in court to see the __dirty-dancing__ video . she has n't been seen in court since march 6 . but jenkins ' name did come up in court regarding a defense motion to suppress evidence gathered from hernandez 's house in november 2014 . jurors were not present for that debate . the prosecution showed __before-and-after__ photos of a closet in hernandez 's home in north attleboro . one photo from june 2013 showed the sneakers hernandez wore the night lloyd was killed . it also showed the shoes hernandez associate carlos ortiz wore the same night . the two pairs of shoes rested on top of a bunch of other shoes . in the second photo , taken in november 2014 , the same closet is seen with all of the shoes except the ones hernandez and ortiz were wearing the night of the shooting . they were no longer in the closet or any other part of the house . prosecutors wanted to link jenkins to the disappearance of the shoes . mccauley referred to the defendant 's jailhouse comments that `` she does what i want , '' referring to jenkins . mccauley also told the judge that hernandez `` was directing her -lrb- jenkins -rrb- to give money to tanya singleton at the time where he had just recently told her not to talk . '' he added , `` we know she did n't talk and then was held in contempt . '' tanya singleton is hernandez 's cousin . court observers wonder when jenkins will be back . the last time jenkins was in court , a reporter noticed she was no longer wearing her engagement ring . however , jenkins is facing perjury charges for allegedly lying to investigators and has been granted immunity to testify at the trial . will testimony about hernandez 's liaisons with other women -- and negative texts about jenkins -- affect her testimony ? does her absence mean she 'll turn on her fiance ? the answers may be a few weeks away . there are indications the commonwealth may wrap up its case by mid-april , . much testimony focused on the shoes hernandez wore the night lloyd was shot . a nike consultant testified that hernandez was wearing nike air jordan retro 11 lows in a size 13 . about 93,000 pairs of that shoe were made , significantly fewer in a size 13 . the shoe 's sole makes a distinct impression , according to lt. steven bennett of the massachusetts state police . the consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney jamie sultan that other nike shoes -- more than 3 million -- make the same impression . yet bennett , who works in crime scene services , testified that the footwear impression left near lloyd 's body was `` in agreement '' or consistent with the air jordan retro 11 lows size 13 . although he did not have the shoes that hernandez wore that night , he an identical pair to make his determination . bennett did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression . jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression . what may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney jamie sultan . sultan questioned the science behind analyzing foot impressions , and he introduced a march 2014 report from bennett saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to make a comparison . sultan hammered bennett on that report . bennett admitted that his __reexamination__ helped the prosecution . mccauley was able to undo some of the damage , allowing bennett to explain that it was only after gaining access to air jordan retro __11s__ in december 2014 that he was able to make a comparison . he testified that what he thought was a lack of distinction were actually gaps in the design of the sole . it 's clear from the testimony and the filing for a search warrant in november 2014 that investigators overlooked the shoes worn by hernandez , ortiz and ernest wallace -- another co-defendant -- the night of lloyd 's death , despite having a photo of them from june 2013 . seventeen months into the investigation , they searched hernandez 's house again . none of the shoes were found . the prosecution brought in three separate witnesses who either owned or worked for companies in the industrial park along john __dietsch__ boulevard where lloyd 's body was found . with these witnesses and collected surveillance videos , prosecutors gave jurors a road map of the route they say hernandez drove to the __corliss__ landing crime scene . while the car 's make and model are n't __distinguishable__ in the video , jurors could see its lights go by at specific times that match when hernandez , wallace , ortiz and lloyd would have been in the car . tanya singleton arranged for her aunt to drive her and wallace to georgia in the days after lloyd 's death . testifying for the prosecution , __euna__ __ritchon__ said singleton asked her on june 21 , 2013 , to move up her planned trip to visit her daughter in georgia . she brought wallace with her . at the time , singleton was married to __ritchon__ 's nephew , __tl__ singleton . he died in a car crash a little more than a week later . __ritchon__ also testified that wallace suggested using back roads to drive out of connecticut and through new york to avoid tolls . she said wallace carried his clothes in a black trash bag . prosecutors were attempting to get jurors to link it to the black trash bag shayanna jenkins removed from her house just a few days earlier . prosecutors say that bag held the gun used to kill lloyd . after spending the night at the home of __ritchon__ 's daughter , wallace boarded a bus to florida . that 's where he surrendered to police . wallace has pleaded not guilty to the charge of an accessory after the fact of a slaying in lloyd 's death .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- it was a ding , just a `` minor concussion , '' that got chris borland thinking that playing football might not be worth the millions that come with being an nfl player . borland was a rookie linebacker in his first training camp in august when he got his `` bell rung , '' he told espn 's `` outside the lines . '' what did he do ? he kept playing that day , and through an excellent rookie season . but the thought of the permanent damage that might be happening to him kept nagging at him . he talked to his teammates and family , read about concussions and their effects , each day coming closer to the decision that he finally announced this week . at age 24 , not even yet in his prime as an nfl player , borland told his team he was retiring because he was worried about the long-term effects of head trauma . `` i just honestly want to do what 's best for my health , '' he told espn . `` from what i 've researched and what i 've experienced , i do n't think it 's worth the risk . ... i 'm concerned that if you wait -lrb- until -rrb- you have symptoms , it 's too late . '' it was after that self-described `` minor concussion '' in the preseason that borland threw himself into researching what had happened to other football players . in the end he did n't want to leave his teammates in a bind , but , `` i know this is right for me . '' he said teammates ' reactions to his retirement were mixed . one of his best friends told him that he was crazy to walk away from the money . borland , a third-round pick from wisconsin , had signed a nearly $ 3 million contract for four seasons with the san francisco 49ers and banked a $ 600,000 bonus . the guys who wanted him to come back would say to the 49ers top __tackler__ , `` that 's a lot of money . why do n't you get your money and get out , '' borland recounted to espn . the thought made him uncomfortable because he does n't want to do anything just for a big paycheck . he did n't want to be wrong when it comes to this : `` who knows how many hits are too many ? '' borland is one of a handful of players to retire young but possibly the first to retire before concussions became an issue for him . he 's also now part of a shift in thinking about what repeated head injuries can do to an athlete . reports show an increasing number of retired nfl players who have suffered concussions developed memory and cognitive issues such as dementia , alzheimer 's disease , depression and chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or cte . `` for me , it 's wanting to be proactive , '' borland said . `` i 'm concerned that if you wait -lrb- until -rrb- you have symptoms , it 's too late . there are a lot of unknowns . i ca n't claim that ` x ' will happen . `` i just want to live a long , healthy life , and i do n't want to have any neurological diseases or die younger than i would otherwise . '' passionate reactions to his decision came quickly , with many supporting him . others say that while the move might be smart for borland , and even encourage other players to speak out and stand up for their health , there will always be plenty of guys eager to replace players like him . borland told espn that he was n't saying no one should play football . he said youth players and their parents should do things : 1 -rrb- get informed about concussions and 2 -rrb- never let anyone play . last august , thousands of former nfl players and their families reached a deal in a class-action suit that called for the nfl to cover the cost of __concussion-related__ compensation , medical exams and medical research for retired players and their families . the suit alleged that the nfl deliberately misled players about scientific data that the medical community had found about the risks associated with concussions . in july 2014 , a federal judge granted preliminary approval to the landmark deal but she has yet to give final approval to the settlement . chris __dronett__ was one of the plaintiffs . her husband , former denver bronco shane __dronett__ , committed suicide in 2009 when he was 38 . after his death , scientists found evidence of cte in his brain . borland named three players he said made him rethink a life in the nfl . `` i 've thought about what i could accomplish in football , but for me personally , when you read about mike webster and dave duerson and ray __easterling__ , you read all these stories . and to be the type of player i want to be in football , i think i 'd have to take on some risks that as a person i do n't want to take on , '' he said . webster had a career with the pittsburgh steelers and kansas city chiefs from 1974 to 1990 . he was the first former nfl player to be diagnosed with cte . after he retired , he was diagnosed with amnesia , dementia , depression , and bone and muscle pain . he was 50 when he died . duerson killed himself with a gunshot to the chest . he had sent a text to his family asking that his brain be sent to boston university school of medicine , which was researching cte . bu neurologists confirmed the nfl veteran had the disease . __easterling__ , who played eight seasons with the atlanta falcons , committed suicide in 2012 . he apparently suffered dementia . an autopsy revealed he had cte . some on social media said borland 's decision made them think about former nfl linebacker junior seau . he was 43 when he was found dead with a gunshot wound to the chest . friends and family members say multiple concussions were to blame for the suicide , but an initial autopsy report found no apparent brain damage . portions of seau 's brain were sent to the national institutes of health , which found `` abnormalities ... that are consistent with a form '' of cte . he will be inducted into the pro football hall of fame this summer . the nfl has reported that in 2013 , 228 concussions were diagnosed from practices and games . at least 261 were diagnosed the previous year , the league said . in its statement about borland 's retirement , jeff miller , the nfl 's senior vice president for health and safety , said : `` we respect chris borland 's decision and wish him all the best . playing any sport is a personal decision . by any measure , football has never been safer and we continue to make progress with rule changes , safer tackling techniques at all levels of football , and better equipment , protocols and medical care for players . '' miller added that the league understands there is more work to do to improve player safety . complaints keep coming . in july of last year , __ex-nfl__ players christian ballard and gregory __westbrooks__ filed suit against the nfl players association , alleging the union withheld information about head injuries . opinion : why are these __nflers__ retiring early ? cnn 's jill martin contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     coral gables , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- former president bill clinton on saturday defended his family foundation 's practice of taking money from foreign countries , arguing that while he does n't agree with all of the policies of countries that contributed , he feels the foundation has `` done a lot more good than harm . '' the clinton foundation admitted last month that a 2010 donation from the algerian government was not properly approved under the guidelines the obama administration put in place with the foundation when hillary clinton became secretary of state in 2009 . bill clinton defended the donations as something that went to worthwhile projects . `` the uae -lsb- united arab emirates -rsb- gave us money . do we agree with everything they do ? no . but they are helping us fight isis and they built a great university with nyu open to people around the world , '' clinton said at a foundation event in florida . `` do i agree with all the foreign policy of saudi arabia ? no . '' saudi arabia , the united arab emirates and oman are among the countries that donated to the clinton foundation . clinton continued : `` you 've got to decide when you do this work , whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country . ... i believe we have done a lot more good than harm . '' the story became a controversy for the clintons , one where even some democrats questioned the practice . hillary clinton is the party 's presidential frontrunner in 2016 and is expected to announce her presidential aspirations next month . republicans jumped on board the story , too , using it to question the clintons ' ethics and whether , as president , she would give preferential treatment to countries that have donated to the foundation . democrats that did publicly defend the clintons noted that the foundation disclosed all of their donation on their website . on saturday , clinton did the same . `` my theory about all this is disclose everything . and then let people make their judgments , '' clinton said . `` i 'm going to tell you who gave us money and you can make your own decisions . '' clinton concluded his defense of the foundation , stating that he thinks organizations should `` bring people together across great divides , around things that they can agree on and find something to do to make peoples lives better . '' the clinton foundation was founded by bill clinton after he left the presidency in 2001 . to date , the foundation has raised over $ 2 billion that goes toward a wide variety of projects , including health and wellness , economic development and leveling the playing field for women and girls . many of their projects focus on international issues , such as rebuilding haiti after the 2010 earthquake and providing access to low-cost hiv and aids treatment . those were primarily the projects backed by foreign countries . the former president 's comments were the only moment any clinton mentioned the foreign fundraising controversy . neither hillary or chelsea clinton mentioned the issue . at no point saturday did any of the clintons address the fact that hillary clinton exclusively used a private email account for the four years she served as america 's top diplomat , a practice that __skirted__ legal standards in place . the former secretary of state spent 18 minutes on stage saturday and did n't mention question about her email , instead focusing on the foundation and a new report they will put out on women and girls participation . that did n't bother the over 1,000 __overachieving__ millennials at the clinton global initiative university meeting who could n't have cared less about the swirling email and fundraising controversies that have defined the clintons the last few weeks . saturday 's event is the __university-focused__ branch of the clinton foundation . it brings philanthropic minded students from around the world together to talk about their projects and pitch the foundation for funding . this year brought together students looking to do a wide variety of things , from increasing women 's inclusion in science and math fields to harvesting __potable__ water from fog . in total , the foundation will hand out $ 900,000 to the different students . the general sense among the event attendees was : `` what controversies ? '' `` i am here for me . i am here for learning , exploring , meeting new people and expanding my knowledge about nonprofit management and social change , '' said __armel__ arnaud __nibasumba__ , a __middlebury__ college student born and raised in burundi . `` i do n't really care if they address those political issues that are going on . '' a few students , including victoria __arild__ from menlo college , said they had n't heard of the controversies . `` i am here because my college , i had the privilege of them funding me , '' she said , before shrugging off questions about the email issues .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- saudi and allied warplanes struck rebels in yemen on thursday , with saudi arabia threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor 's civil war , potentially opening up a broader sectarian conflict in the middle east . the swift and sudden action involved 100 saudi jets , 30 from the united arab emirates , 15 each from kuwait and bahrain , 10 from qatar , and a handful from jordan , morocco and sudan , plus naval help from pakistan and egypt , according to a saudi adviser . the egyptian state news agency on thursday quoted egypt 's foreign ministry as saying egypt 's support also could involve ground forces . what do those countries have in common ? they 're all predominantly sunni muslim -- in contrast to the houthi rebels , shiite muslims who have taken over yemen 's capital of sanaa and on wednesday captured parts of its second-largest city , aden . the saudis consider the houthis proxies for the shiite government of iran and fear another shiite-dominated state in the region . `` what they do not want is an __iranian-run__ state on their southern border , '' cnn military analyst lt. col. rick __francona__ said of the saudis . the airstrikes did not include warplanes from the united states , which has worked with yemeni governments -- including that of recently deposed but still battling president abdu __rabu__ mansour hadi -- to go after al qaeda in the arabian peninsula . in fact , a senior official in president barack obama 's administration said `` there will be no military intervention by the u.s. '' but u.s. secretary of state john kerry on thursday did tell foreign ministers from saudi arabia , the uae , qatar , kuwait , bahrain and oman that the united states __commends__ the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing , targeting assistance and logistical support , according to a senior state department official . how did yemen get to this place ? houthi supreme leader abdul malik __al-houthi__ spoke live thursday night in yemen on __al-masirah__ tv , saying , `` if any army try to invade our country , we will prove that yemen will be a grave for those who invade us . '' he added , `` we call on the invaders to stop the attacks and if the airstrikes do not end then we will escalate in the needed manner . '' iran denounced the military intervention . __marzieh__ __afkham__ , a spokeswoman for the country 's foreign ministry , said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to yemen 's __monthslong__ internal strife . it also wo n't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like isis and al qaeda , she said . `` this is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries ' national sovereignty , '' __afkham__ said , according to a report in iran 's state-run islamic republic news agency . iraq -- 60 % of whose citizens are shiite , with about 20 % being sunnis -- offered similar , albeit a bit more muted opposition to what its foreign ministry called `` the military interference of the gulf cooperation council , '' which is made up of bahrain , kuwait , oman , qatar , saudi arabia and the uae . `` we call on the arab states to live up to their role to support national dialogue -lrb- that includes -rrb- all political forces to find a political solution for the crisis , '' the iraqi ministry said . the houthis are a minority group that has emerged as the most powerful player in yemen . in addition to airstrikes , the saudi adviser said 150,000 troops could take part in an operation in yemen . just a day in , the coalition airstrikes are already costing the houthis . hundreds of explosions ripped through sanaa overnight , said journalist hakim __almasmari__ , who is staying in the capital . the health ministry reported 18 dead and 24 wounded in sanaa , the __houthi-run__ saba news agency said . while sanaa was a focus -- airstrikes destroyed the houthis ' combat and control operations there , the saudi adviser said -- it was n't the only place struck . compounds and military installations in __saada__ and taiz also were targeted . by thursday afternoon , the saudis controlled yemeni airspace , the adviser said , and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter yemeni ports . the military operation , dubbed __al-hazm__ storm , was launched after the houthis rebuffed an initiative by the gulf cooperation council , arab league chief nabil __al-arabi__ said in a speech thursday . it was done in accord with a joint arab defense treaty , __al-arabi__ said . specifically , the strikes aim to support hadi , who was ousted in january after talks with the houthis faltered , but still claims to be yemen 's rightful leader . `` we are determined to protect the legitimate government of yemen , '' said adel __al-jubeir__ , the saudi ambassador to the united states , in announcing the beginning of the military campaign . `` having yemen fail can not be an option for us or for our coalition partners . '' why is saudi arabia bombing yemen ? __jubeir__ told cnn 's `` the situation room with wolf blitzer '' that saudi arabia was concerned that the houthis had control over yemen 's armed forces ballistic missiles and air force , and the fact that iran backs the houthis was troubling . `` this is really a war to defend the legitimate government of yemen and protect the yemeni people from takeover by a radical militant group aligned with iran and hezbollah , '' he said . american military commanders said they did n't know about saudi arabia 's action until the last minute . `` we have been discussing this matter with the united states in principle for many months , '' __jubeir__ said . `` we have been discussing this matter in more detail as the time approached and the final decision to take action did n't really happen until the last minute , because of circumstances in yemen . '' egyptian foreign minister __sameh__ __shoukry__ on thursday proposed a joint arab military `` to deal with these challenges . '' but at least one major player in yemen besides the houthis -- the general people 's congress , which is the party of longtime leader ali abdullah saleh -- thinks the saudis and their partners should stay out . the __gpc__ says the airstrikes have already led to civilian casualties . the best way to stop the bloodshed is to bring everyone to the negotiating table , the group said . `` the -lrb- party -rrb- expresses its rejection of the attack on the republic of yemen and the capital , sanaa , considering what -lrb- is -rrb- happening is an internal affair , '' the __gpc__ said . '' ... the general people 's congress -lrb- calls on all parties -rrb- to return to and accelerate the completion of a national , historic agreement that ... maintains unity and democracy . '' meanwhile , the last person to be elected president of yemen -- even if he was the only one on the ballot -- is out of the country and will soon be headed to egypt to petition arab officials , according to yemeni officials . the location of hadi had been a mystery for days , with conflicting reports about whether he 'd left yemen and where he 'd gone . saudi arabia 's state news agency , spa , reported that hadi arrived thursday in riyadh , where he met with the saudi defense minister and intelligence chief . but two yemeni officials close to hadi said that the deposed president is in oman . they said that his next stop , on friday , will be an arab league summit in sharm el-sheikh , egypt . meanwhile , some 3,000 to 5,000 troops from the __saudi-led__ coalition are expected to reach aden , the yemeni city that was hadi 's last known location , in the next three days , according to the officials . their aim is to make that port city safe enough for hadi to return after the arab league summit . whether the rest of yemen will be secure at that point is another matter . unfortunately , there has been little in the last few months to inspire optimism that peace is around the corner . opinion : why yemen has come undone . cnn 's elise labott , becky anderson , nick paton walsh , michael pearson , anas hamdan , salma abdelaziz and mustafa al-arab contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- a huge obama foreign policy decision , a big immigration question and interesting steps related to hillary clinton , john boehner and marco rubio filled an informative sunday loop around the ` inside politics ' table . there 's nothing like a signature hire to quiet those who think you might blink and skip the fight . at issue is sen. marco rubio of florida , who remains a __single-digit__ blip in republican polls . so weak have his early poll showings been that many __gopers__ to this day say they would not be shocked if he decided not to move from exploratory candidate to official candidate . but a new hire sends a signal . veteran south carolina gop strategist j. warren tompkins is signing on to run a __pro-rubio__ super pac . that same pac is in line for seed money from florida billionaire norman __braman__ . tompkins is a protege of the late gop gov. carroll campbell and legendary south carolina strategist lee atwater . his hiring is seen as a signal in gop circles that rubio is close to launching . for those of us who lived through the clinton white house years , and especially the monica lewinsky scandal , it was interesting to say the least listening to hillary clinton a few days ago wax nostalgic about her relationship with newt gingrich . and the former house speaker shared similar fond memories in a conversation with jackie kucinich of the daily beast . but do n't break into `` __kumbaya__ '' or order the marshmallows . `` he said , if she becomes president , she 'll be a hard worker ; she 'll be pretty practical , '' said kucinich . `` however , he does n't think she 's going to get there because of what 's happening with the clinton global foundation and because of the foreign money . he 's testifying to the homeland security committee next week and he says he 's going to bring up the problem of foreign money in american politics . '' it 's been a rough start for the republican congress and house speaker john boehner . but boehner sees a chance to get two __big-ticket__ items on their way to passage , and through those debates to get the house back on a more productive track . robert costa of the washington post shared his reporting on the speaker 's calculations -- including one health care bill where he struck up an alliance with democratic leader nancy pelosi . `` there 's two pieces of legislation to really keep an eye on that he wants to muscle through , '' said costa . `` one is the republican budget : he wants to just get it through the house , get a compromise with the senate . and the next is the doc fix bill , which is how medicare reimbursements are done for doctors . boehner wants to solve that long-term and it looks like he is going to have the votes to get it done . '' president obama meets with afghan president ashraf ghani this week , and is open to slowing the withdrawal of u.s. forces . a big change , but with a bigger goal in mind . julie pace of the associated press shared inside reporting on the administration 's willingness to leave up to 10,000 u.s. troops in afghanistan for the time being . `` there 's one big reason why the president is going to have some flexibility in the drawdown , and that 's because he 's very focused on one specific aspect of this plan , and that is pulling out all u.s. troops by the end of 2016 , '' said pace . `` that would allow him to make the case at the end of his presidency that he had fulfilled his promise to end the war in afghanistan . '' the always intense political debate over immigration policy heated up last spring during a dramatic surge in the number of young children illegally crossing into the united states . the surge undermined what was already a long shot chance of congressional consensus on immigration reform . npr 's steve __inskeep__ reports that both policymakers and political strategists are watching to see if there is a similar seasonal surge this year . `` now we 're getting back into the spring season , when it 's a little bit easier to travel , and we 'll see if the numbers go up again , '' said __inskeep__ . `` if they do , of course , we 're going to have another series of news stories about a really sensitive issue that 's been very difficult for either party to solve .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- organized labor is up in arms about president barack obama 's effort to obtain fast-track authority to finalize a free trade agreement in the asia pacific that involves 11 nations . the agreement , union leaders argue , threatens to take even more jobs away from americans . afl-cio president richard __trumka__ sent a clear message to members of congress , warning , `` there is such a dramatic impact on the standard of living and lowering of wages and a loss of jobs -- this will have a major impact , and then we will not forget this vote for a long time . '' the afl-cio announced that it would withhold donations to political action committees until this controversy cleared up . the tension between organized labor and obama is not new . the struggles have been going on since 2009 when the president allowed the employee free choice act to wither in congress . the act would require that a union be deemed as legitimate when it had the support of a majority of employees and imposed tough penalties on employers who tried to punish workers from forming unions . the president avoided making any strong appeals for the bill , though it was greatly desired by labor organizations as a way to increase membership . when democrats chose charlotte , north carolina , for their 2012 political convention -- a city not friendly to labor -- unions were livid . `` there is broad frustration with the party and all elected officials , '' one labor leader said , `` broad frustration with the lack of a union agenda . '' even though unions were crucial to administration victories such as the affordable care act , president obama has often been extremely tepid when it comes to the rights of unions . organized labor has not been that surprised . the truth is that unions have been on the defense against democratic presidents for decades . in the 1970s , president jimmy carter treated unions like one more special interest in washington that needed to be brought down while president bill clinton demonstrated lukewarm support to these organizations as he aggressively pursued global free trade policies that labor opposed . `` it will cost jobs , '' warned michigan democrat david __bonior__ said of the north american free trade agreement that clinton endorsed . `` it will drive down our standard of living . if we do n't stand up for the working people in this country , who is going to ? '' in the past few decades , many democratic politicians no longer believed that organized labor was a major player within their party , as they had been during the creation of the new deal and great society . as organized labor became a smaller part of the american workforce , democratic politicians were not as determined to court their vote . a larger number of democrats since the 1970s have been elected by upper middle class suburban constituencies in which unions are not a big presence . these voters have been more concerned in a style of liberalism that revolves around quality of life issues , such as environmental regulation , than they are with middle class jobs . many democrats leaders embraced a vision of economic policy that centered on deregulation and free markets . new voices that came into the democratic party after the 1960s wanted to challenge republicans by offering a more centrist vision of economic policy . the opportunities for democrats to embrace a more pro-union agenda have only intensified with the fierce assault taking place among conservatives . the koch brothers have unleashed fierce financial assault against unions . scott walker , the governor of wisconsin and potential republican presidential candidate , has stripped away the power of public unions and signed a right to work law that barred unions from collecting dues from employees who were n't in unions . unions are under assault , and the movement is looking for help . democrats , and some republicans , often talk about needing to deal with the problem of economic inequality . much of the talk is often vague and offers little in the way to real solutions . shoring up the strength of unions is one area where the government can help protect jobs for middle class americans . without strong unions , the battle against economic inequality and insecurity will never really get started . as george gresham , the president of united health care workers east wrote in the new york times , `` by defunding unions and weakening union members via ` right to work ' laws , corporations and those that do their bidding remove workers ' primary means of raising wages , securing pensions and improving workers conditions . workers ' main vehicle for advancing themselves and their communities is jeopardized . '' democrats need to listen to what the afl-cio is saying . they need to push back against president obama , even if this creates political opportunities for republicans , so that the party does not abandon what has been at the heart and soul of their agenda . as democrats continually watch republicans outdo them in terms of organization and pursuit , they need to look to labor more as an ally than an enemy in the battle for the white house and congress in the coming years .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- debra milke spent 22 years on death row , convicted of conspiring with two other men to kill her son allegedly for an insurance payout . on monday , a judge ruled that the arizona woman is innocent and dismissed all charges against her . this makes milke only the second woman exonerated from death row in the united states . more importantly , the judge 's decision finally clears milke after years of legal back-and-forth in a case where she steadfastly maintained her innocence . key to the case 's dismissal was prosecutorial misconduct , mainly that of a detective , armando saldate , who said milke confessed to the crime to him -- even though there was no witness or recording . prosecutors withheld from the jury saldate 's personnel record which showed instances of misconduct in other cases , including lying under oath . the two men with whom milke was accused of conspiring were tried separately and are still on death row . a day after seeing santa claus at a mall on december 1 , 1989 , young christopher milke asked his mother if he could go again . milke 's __roomate__ , james __styers__ , took the boy ; then called milke saying christopher had disappeared . instead , __styers__ and a friend drove the boy out of town to a secluded ravine where __styers__ shot christopher three times in the head , prosecutors said . __styers__ and the friend were convicted of murder and sentenced to death . milke was implicated based on alleged testimony from __styer__ 's friend , roger scott . the detective , saldate , said scott told him that milke was involved in a plot to kill her son . and during her trial , prosecutors floated a likely motive : a $ 5,000 life insurance policy she had taken out on the child . but neither scott nor __styers__ testified to a plot in court . no other witnesses or direct evidence linked milke to the crime other than saldate 's testimony . saldate further said that milke confessed to her role in the murder plot during interrogation and said it was a `` bad judgment call . '' there was no recording of the interrogation , no one else was in the room or watching from a two-way mirror , and saldate said he threw away his notes shortly after completing his report . milke offered a vastly different view of the interrogation and denied that she had confessed to any role . the trial became a __he-said/she-said__ contest between the two . ultimately , the jury believed the detective and convicted milke of murder . what prosecutors did n't tell the court was the detective 's long history of lying under oath and misconduct . saldate had been suspended five days for taking `` liberties '' with a female motorist and lying about it to his supervisors . four confessions or indictments had been tossed out because saldate had lied under oath . judges suppressed or vacated four other confessions because saldate had violated a person 's constitutional rights . in 2013 , after more than 20 years in jail , an appeals court overturned milke 's conviction . `` the constitution requires a fair trial , '' chief judge alex __kozinski__ of the federal 9th circuit court of appeals wrote . `` this never happened in milke 's case . '' `` the state knew of the evidence in the personnel file and had an obligation to produce the documents , '' __kozinski__ said . '' ... there can be no doubt that the state failed in its constitutional obligation . '' milke was released on bail , and the court said she could n't be tried again . the state appealed the decision to the arizona supreme court . last week , the arizona supreme court refused to hear the appeal . and on monday , all charges against milke were finally dropped . the ankle bracelet she had been wearing while on bail was removed . and milke left the court room , sobbing in relief . the case is now closed . debra milke is finally a free woman .

'' the abductions are more evidence of the turmoil libya has experienced since 2011 , the start of an uprising against longtime dictator moammar gadhafi . sirte was gadhafi 's hometown , where he was killed , and where his loyalists held out the longest . in the years since , sirte has become a home to isis . the coastal city , halfway between tripoli and benghazi , is where terrorists kidnapped 21 coptic christians from egypt in separate incidents in december and january . that mass abduction was followed by mass slaughter -- one that , in isis ' distinctive , depraved style , was videotaped and disseminated as propaganda , showing jihadists standing behind their __orange-clad__ , handcuffed victims and then beheading them . `` the sea you have hidden sheikh osama bin laden 's body in , '' a masked english-speaking jihadi said on the video , `` we swear to allah , we will mix it with your blood . '' like the egyptians , the medical workers kidnapped monday are foreigners , having come to sirte to work . they also have skills that could help isis . the ibn sina hospital official believes the extremist group went after the workers -- who 'd been trying to flee sirte 's precarious security situation -- because they make up the only medical team there and might be needed to treat isis militants . the large-scale kidnapping illustrates how isis has become a disruptive force in africa . the group 's main foothold is in iraq and syria , where it has ruthlessly conquered territory and threatened to take more despite efforts by local governments and a u.s.-led air campaign . isis branched out into libya last year , with cnn reporting in november that fighters loyal to the group had complete control of __derna__ , a city of about 100,000 near the egyptian border . militants who 've pledged allegiance to isis also have made their mark in points westward , forming chapters in cities including sirte , benghazi and tripoli , according to __noman__ __benotman__ , a former libyan jihadist now involved in counterterrorism as head of the quilliam foundation . besides its actions in __derna__ and sirte , isis ' libyan branch claimed responsibility for a january attack on a luxury hotel in tripoli that killed 10 people , one of them american david berry . but isis is n't just active in libya . earlier this month , boko haram -- another islamist extremist group with its own reputation for mass abductions and craven brutality -- pledged allegiance to isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi . this bond gives isis a gateway to west africa and specifically to nigeria , africa 's most populous nation and boko haram 's home .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- i was in florida last year when i got a call asking me to pose for a calendar . what ? a calendar ? as in sports illustrated swimsuit ? victoria 's secret angels ? cover girls . __pinups__ . movie stars . glam . i agreed , and now i am ms. december . but it is n't quite what you think . the caller on the other end that day was patti tripathi . she was an anchor at cnn headline news at a time when there were few __indian-american__ women in high-profile media jobs . tripathi has her own media company now , but more recently she launched a nonprofit called __saris__ to suits . she was asking me to help . she began by telling me her story . she was 12 when her family immigrated to the united states . indian parents often have to save a lot of money to ensure a good marriage for their daughter . tripathi said that was a big reason why her family left . we spoke about similar experiences as indian teenagers in america . she was not allowed to go to the prom or wear shorts , except to play tennis . she had an 8 p.m. curfew and her father expected she would be married soon after college . tripathi felt like a burden . she did everything she could to stand on her own . and she did . my father was not as stern but he had a hard time watching his little girl become `` __americanized__ . '' i , too , longed to be independent , far more so than was expected of a bengali girl in the 1970s . at an __all-girls__ convent school in kolkata , i used to climb up three flights of stairs to reach my classroom . on every landing were oversized portraits of national leaders , most of them indian . hundreds of girls in white uniforms made the __stampede-like__ dash up the stairwell . it was impossible to stop but i always looked up when i arrived at indira gandhi . there she was , in her trademark white sari and what i thought was a __cruella__ de __vil__ slice in her hair . in a nation that valued boys more than girls , i was in awe that we had a female prime minister . gandhi 's political career turned out to be less than stellar , but it was 1971 and i was not yet 9 years old . i wanted to grow up to be just like her . regal . smart . and most of all , in control of my destiny . i know so many other indian girls felt the same . we had dreams . big dreams . we wanted to be someone , do something rewarding with our lives . yet for so many girls in india , dreams are vanquished by nightmare life scenarios . they are denied education and married off within months of their first period . i have met women who were abducted and forced into prostitution or lived with physically and mentally abusive men . those problems are not limited to india or the rest of south asia . they exist in the immigrant communities in the united states , in which abuse and crimes are __underreported__ because of the stigma that still exists . women are often ashamed to talk about these things . as an __indian-american__ journalist , i have told stories with hopes of casting light on the world inhabited by many south asian women . i have mentored girls in my hometown of kolkata . and always wondered : what else can i do ? some of that desire stems from my own circumstances in life . as a newborn , i was left on the steps of an orphanage in north kolkata . it happened to be run by an american missionary , helen benedict , who happened to meet my adoptive mother at the __indo-american__ society . my mother was honing her english speaking skills there . that was in 1962 and my parents were childless after 10 years of marriage . it 's not hard to guess the rest of the story . instead of growing up in harsh surroundings , i was raised in a professor 's house . and , instead of a future that might have been filled with darkness , i faced one that was bright . i had loving parents , attended good schools and traveled around the world . there is not a day that goes by when i do n't think about the life i might have led had it not been for that fateful meeting between an american missionary and a bengali woman __pining__ to become a mother . i shared my story with tripathi and told her i would help . tripathi put together __saris__ to suits as an empowerment tool . she wanted to raise money to help south asian women . she also wanted to inspire them , she said . they needed strong role models . they needed to know that they could break out of the __molds__ that were cast for them . she was putting together the 2015 __saris__ to suits calendar and wanted to feature south asian women who had found success in america . they were doctors , lawyers , corporate leaders . one was a weightlifter from pakistan who struggled with balancing her sport and her muslim attire . another was miss america 2014 . i felt honored to be in such fine company . i would be the only journalist in the calendar . it would most certainly be my only chance in life to pretend i was a glamour girl . some of the women opted to wear __saris__ , the traditional dress of india . some wore __salwar__ __kameez__ , a long tunic and pants . and some of us were in suits or our work attire . the 2014 calendar , the first one tripathi published , raised money for various organizations that help south asian women . one of them was __raksha__ -lrb- which means protection -rrb- . based in atlanta , __raksha__ provides support for the south asian community in a number of ways . most of its clients are women who are dealing with abusive marriages , divorce and issues with their children . __raksha__ 's executive director , __aparna__ __bhattacharyya__ , told me why the calendar was important . `` i think it is a reminder that there are women overcoming obstacles and that they have the potential to achieve their own goals for themselves , '' she said . `` i think it is powerful for young south asian women to see role models that look like themselves -- role models who are making change and following their dreams . '' her words took me back to my school in kolkata where i gazed upward at indira gandhi 's face . in it , i found strength . i am of course , a far cry from the likes of gandhi , but perhaps i can inspire a teenager out there to be the architect of her future . maybe a young woman in a sari will be able to put on a suit for the first time in her life . besides , it 's kind of cool to be in a calendar .

ARTICEL:     frustrated red bull team boss christian horner was left to reflect on ' a s **** y sunday ' and the fear fans will turn off formula one after mercedes ' domination of the season-opening australian grand prix . after winning the constructors ' and drivers ' titles for four years from __2010-2013__ , with sebastian vettel at the helm , mercedes have taken up the mantle of f1 powerhouse . after winning 16 of 19 grands prix in 2014 to claim the constructors ' crown , and with lewis hamilton clinching his second championship , the start to 2015 was a breeze for mercedes . lewis hamilton -lrb- right -rrb- and nico rosberg finished first and second respectively at the australian grand prix . hamilton races to victory in melbourne as mercedes dominance of formula one rolls on . the two mercedes team-mates celebrate their winning start to the new season with some champagne . __re-live__ every lap of the melbourne race . hamilton beat team-mate nico rosberg by 1.3 secs , with vettel third on his debut for ferrari , but __34.5__ secs off the pace . predicting ' a __two-horse__ race at every grand prix this year ' , horner has called on the fia to act to prevent an f1 yawn , and he is fully aware of how his comments will be viewed given red bull 's past success . ` when we were winning - and we were never winning to the advantage they have - i remember double __diffusers__ were banned , __exhausts__ were moved , flexible bodywork was prohibited , engine mapping mid-season was changed , ' said horner of the steps taken to negate his team 's performance . ` anything was done , and that was n't just unique to red bull , but williams in previous years and mclaren __etcetera__ . ` is it healthy to have this situation ? the fia , within the rules , have an __equalisation__ mechanism and it is perhaps something we need to look at . red bull chief christian horner is concerned that mercedes dominance will be unhealthy for the sport . horner 's red bull team won consecutive titles between __2010-2013__ with sebastian vettel behind the wheel . red bull driver daniil kvyat was forced to retire early in what was called a 's **** y weekend ' by horner . ` mercedes , take nothing away from them , they have done a great job and they have a good car , a fantastic engine , and two very good drivers . ` the problem is the gap is so big you end up with __three-tier__ racing and that 's not healthy for formula one . ` the fia have the facts and they could quite easily come up with some form of __equalisation__ otherwise i fear the interest will wane . ' i did n't see mercedes much on the tv , and i can only imagine that 's because it 's not interesting watching a procession and the producer was looking to pick out other battles in the race . ' referring to the fact hollywood star arnold schwarzenegger conducted the podium ceremony , horner added : ` the highlight for me was seeing arnie on the podium ! ' horner 's comments were borne out of exasperation at the job __power-unit__ supplier renault have done since the system came into force at the start of last season . the hope was renault would have closed the gap to mercedes over the winter , but instead they appear to have fallen further steps back . hollywood actor arnold schwarzenegger interviewed winner hamilton after the race in australia . the former governor of california raises a smile from third placed sebastian vettel now of ferrari . an angry horner , who saw daniil kvyat retire on the formation lap with a gearbox issue , said : ` it 's been a tough weekend and a very tough weekend for renault . ` the engine is quite __undriveable__ and you can see and hear that from the comments the drivers are making . ` they need to have a clear vision and they need it quickly because it 's frustrating we are effectively further back than we were in abu dhabi in both power and __driveability__ . ` it 's disappointing and been a s *** y sunday for us . we can only get better and get our heads down and work harder at it .

ARTICEL:     true meaning of easter : the eggs were backed by archbishop of york john sentamu , who is urging the supermarkets to rethink . supermarkets have been accused of pursuing an ` __anti-__ christian agenda ' after refusing to sell easter eggs with a religious message . some of britain 's biggest stores are celebrating the most profound event in the church calendar by offering treats featuring everything from darth vader to postman pat -- but turned down products that mention jesus . one chain even asked ` what has easter got to do with the church ? ' , according to the makers of the real easter egg , which features christian crosses on the box and contain a leaflet telling the story of the resurrection . now archbishop of york john sentamu has stepped in -- urging sainsbury 's , asda and the co-op to stock the charity eggs -- while former archbishop of canterbury george carey said he was ` saddened ' by the three supermarket giants ' decision . lord carey said : ` the rest are rubbish . these easter eggs that have nothing to do with easter , all they are trying to do is get more money out of people . they have no meaning . i think it shows ignorance on the part of these supermarkets . ` by not offering an alternative to secular easter eggs they are really undermining the real message of easter . it saddens me because we are living in a land that is completely losing contact with its religious roots and is out of touch with the christian message . ' david marshall , the head of the meaningful chocolate company , said the supermarkets appeared biased against its ` proven seller ' . he said : ` we do wonder at times if there is an __anti-christian__ agenda from some of our supermarkets who just keep turning it down . it is as if some feel christianity is politically incorrect or the easter story , which mentions jesus , might put people off . ` one buyer asked us what easter had got to do with the church , while another simply said , `` i do n't think this is a credible product '' and asked us to leave . ' the __warrington-based__ firm has spent five years trying to persuade stores to sell its # 4 __christian-themed__ eggs , which were launched in 2010 with the backing of archbishop sentamu . at first the supermarkets refused , but two years ago , tesco , morrisons , sainsbury 's , waitrose and the co-op bowed to pressure and agreed . but this year sainsbury 's and the co-op have dropped the eggs , blaming poor sales , while asda has never stocked them . however , the meaningful chocolate company say a million eggs have been sold over the past five years . ` poor sales ' : sainsbury 's and co-op have cited poor sales as the reason they dropped the eggs , while asda said it has not be approached by the makers of the egg . archbishop sentamu , who has lamented ignorance about easter after learning that a third of children thought it marked the birthday of the easter bunny , said yesterday : ` with a million real easter eggs sold i am delighted that morrisons , tesco and waitrose have met the challenge . i call on sainsbury 's , asda , and the co-operative to give their customers the same choice . ' sainsbury 's said their decision was based on ` the popularity of ranges in previous years ' , with the co-op also citing ` poor sales of the real easter egg in previous years ' . asda said it had not been approached this year , a claim disputed by the meaningful chocolate company .

ARTICEL:     males of a species of crab , nicknamed after david hasselhoff because of their hairy chests , spend largely separate lives from the females , according to new research . in a study looking at the private life of the deep-sea crab known as the ` __hoff__ ' have found that the males and females spend separate lives at volcanic vents 1.5 miles deep near antarctica . this , according to the british research , is because of the conflicting demands of feeding and raising young among the sexes . males of a species of crab , nicknamed after david hasselhoff because of their hairy chests , spend separate lives from the females , according to new research . in a study looking at the private life of the deep-sea crab known as the ` __hoff__ ' have found that the males and females spend separate lives at volcanic vents . the __hasselhof__ crab was discovered in 2012 living around volcanic vents off south georgia . it is a type of yeti crab recognised for their hairs , or __setae__ , along their and limbs that they use to cultivate the bacteria which they eat . the new are slightly different in that they exhibit long __setae__ on their __undersides__ . they were named after actor david __hasselhof__ because of his hairy chest . despite living apart from females , the males live in remarkable density . in some places , scientists say the crabs reach as many as 600 individuals per square metre . in 2010 , a british expedition revealed a ` lost world ' of deep-sea animals including the crab named after the baywatch star thriving on the ocean floor near antarctica . using a __deep-diving__ remotely operated vehicle -lrb- __rov__ -rrb- to examine the distribution , size and sex of these crabs at the vents , dr leigh marsh and colleagues from the university of southampton have now pieced together their private lives . dr marsh said : ` the life cycles of deep-sea animals have been largely hidden from us until now but thanks to more frequent expeditions and advances in technology , we are getting a clearer picture of the natural history of the ocean depths that cover most of our world . ' the researchers found that large male __hoff__ crabs live highest on the mineral spires of the deep-sea vents , closest to the hot fluids that jet from them . a university spokesman said : ` at the base of the mineral spires , smaller males mingle with females in spectacular piles , many crabs deep , where they get together to mate . ` the females then crawl away from the bustling piles of crabs and the warm __mineral-rich__ fluids seeping from the seafloor , which can be toxic to their young . ` away from the mineral spires , the few crabs found by the researchers were all females , carrying developing offspring under their __curled-up__ tails . males do n't share in ` __child-care__ ' arrangements with the females , and can climb up the mineral spires of the vents to take advantage of the warmth and conditions best suited for growing bacteria on their hairy chests . ` moving away from the warmer waters of the spires takes the females across a gauntlet of predators , such as large sea __anemones__ and __seven-arm__ sea stars . ` away from the vents , the cold water of the deep antarctic also slows down the metabolism of the adult female crabs , making them less active than in the warmer waters of the jostling piles . ` however , the conditions away from the vents may be more stable and less harmful to their offspring for their early development , making the journey of the females worthwhile . males , meanwhile , do n't share in ` __child-care__ ' arrangements with the females , and instead can climb up the mineral spires of the vents to take advantage of the warmth and conditions best suited for growing bacteria on their hairy chests . by scraping off and eating these bacteria using __comb-like__ __mouthparts__ , the males can grow much larger than the females . study co-author dr jon copley said : ` deep-sea vents are __island-like__ habitats on the seafloor , and discoveries like these show that our exploration of the life that thrives around them has only just begun . ' the __hasselhof__ crab was discovered in 2012 living around volcanic vents off south georgia . it is a type of yeti crab recognised for their hairs , or __setae__ , along their and limbs that they use to cultivate the bacteria which they eat . they were named after actor david __hasselhof__ -lrb- pictured -rrb- because of his hairy chest .

' gordon 's impassioned assertion was made during a dramatic intervention staged by dr phil last week and due to air today . weeping and wailing and at times incoherent , gordon had believed that he was to be interviewed by dr phil . gordon had told the eminent psychologist that he wanted to tell his side of the story . he has felt ` vilified ' and ` depicted as a monster ' since january 31 when bobby kristina , 22 , was found face down and unresponsive in the __bath-tub__ at the roswell , georgia home he and bobby kristina shared . breakdown : with his mother , michelle , by his side nick gordon struggles to stay coherent . troubling preview : a trailer for the interview of bobbi kristina brown 's boyfriend nick gordon by dr phil mcgraw was released sunday night . swinging from crying to flying into a rage , the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by dr phil . but on learning of gordon 's emotional , mental and physical state dr phil could not ` in good conscience ' go on with the interview . according to gordon 's mother , michelle , who was by her son 's side during the highly emotional intervention , ` nicholas is at a breaking point . he can not bear not being without __krissy__ , by her side . he 's dealing with it by drinking . i 've begged him to stop . ' dr phil told gordon , who admitted to having taken xanax and to have drunk heavily prior to the meeting : ` nick , you 're out of control . you 've threatened suicide . you deserved to get some help because if you do n't , you know you 're going to wind up dead . ' he added : ` you 've got to get yourself cleaned up . you got to man up and straighten up . ' yesterday dailymail.com revealed that , barely 12 hours before the dramatic encounter with dr phil , gordon was so drunk and high he was unable to walk . the disturbing scenes captured on video showed the true extent of a deterioration described by dr phil as ` exponential . ' in the show , due to broadcast wednesday , a weeping and wailing gordon admitted that he has twice tried to kill himself and confessed : ` i 'm so sorry for everything . ' asked if he still intended to kill himself he said : ` if anything happens to __krissi__ i will . ' he said : ` my pain is horrible . my heart hurts . i have panic attacks . ' in recent weeks gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of xanax , alcohol and prescription sleeping pills . gordon had agreed to meet with dr phil believing that he was there to be interviewed . according to dr phil : ` he felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster . ' instead , on learning of gordon 's rapidly deteriorating mental , emotional and physical state , the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab . dr phil stated : ' i do n't think he has any chance of turning this round . left to his own devices he will be dead within the week . ' gordon 's mother , michelle , was by her son 's side as he __alternated__ between compliant and aggressive -- at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed . she described her son as ` at breaking point . ' she said : ` he can not take too much more of not being able to see __kriss__ . he blames himself . he 's torn up and carrying guilt . ` he 's dealing with it by drinking . i 've begged him to stop . i 've tried to help him but he ca n't let go of the guilt .

' he added : ` his life absolutely hangs in the balance . ' questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of january 31st that led to bobbi kristina , 22 , ending up face down in her tub . just two days ago bobbi kristina 's aunt , __leolah__ brown , made a series of explosive facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had ` strong __evidene__ of foul play ' relating to gordon 's role in events . she posted : ` nick gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate ! especially to my family . moreover , he has done things to my niece that i never thought he had in him to do ! ' __leolah__ made her claims in response to being invited onto dr phil 's show . tough to watch : the young man sobs and shakes at times through the trailer . in her message she wrote : ` with all due respect , nick gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece ... . we have strong evidence of foul play . ' marks were found on her face and arms , marks that gordon has explained as the result of cpr which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived . and speaking to dr phil , gordon insisted : ' i did everything possible in the world to protect them -lsb- whitney and bobbi kristina -rsb- . ' railing against the decision by bobbi 's father , bobby brown , to ban him from his fiancée 's bedside at atlanta 's emory hospital , gordon said : ` my name will be the first she calls . ' according to his mother , michelle , gordon can not forgive himself for his ` failure ' to revive bobbi kristina . his guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier . ' i hate bobby brown ! ' his tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend 's father bobby brown , who has blocked him from seeing the 22-year-old in the hospital . ` are you drinking ? ' the emotional man 's anger only increases as dr. phil asks about nick 's sobriety . refuses to go : the 25-year-old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help . resigned : ultimately , gordon concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility . then , on 11 february 2012 , it was gordon who tried to resuscitate whitney when she was found unresponsive in her __bath-tub__ just hours before she was due to attend a grammy awards party . speaking to dr phil , michelle said : ` nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed whitney . ` he administered cpr -lsb- to whitney -rsb- and he called me when he was standing over her body . he could n't understand why he could n't revive her . he said , `` mommy why ? i could n't get the air into her lungs . '' gordon has now entered a rehab facility in atlanta . meanwhile his fiancée continues to fight for her life in a medically-induced coma . it is now six weeks since bobbi kristina -- __krissi__ as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the __bath-tub__ of the home she shared with gordon in roswell , georgia . unlike whitney 's death that was ruled accidental , police are treating bobbi kristina 's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22-year-old as a criminal investigation . while bobbi kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with nick , of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident , has emerged . in an interview with the sun a friend of the couple , steven __stepho__ , claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin , xanax , pot and heroin substitute __roxicodone__ . sounding eerily similar to bobbi 's mother and father 's __drug-dependent__ relationship , the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on . ` bobbi and nick would spend a lot on drugs every day , it just depended on how much money they had . it was n't unusual for them to spend $ 1,000 a day on drugs . ` there were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours , just lying there on the bed . there were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice . she was always covered in cigarette burns . ' their relationship was also very volatile . ` when whitney died nick was left with nothing , so he knew he had to control __krissi__ to get access to the money . she 'd do whatever he told her . ` he was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her . they would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around .

ARTICEL:     frustrated red bull team boss christian horner was left to reflect on ' a s **** y sunday ' and the fear fans will turn off formula one after mercedes ' domination of the season-opening australian grand prix . after winning the constructors ' and drivers ' titles for four years from __2010-2013__ , with sebastian vettel at the helm , mercedes have taken up the mantle of f1 powerhouse . after winning 16 of 19 grands prix in 2014 to claim the constructors ' crown , and with lewis hamilton clinching his second championship , the start to 2015 was a breeze for mercedes . lewis hamilton -lrb- right -rrb- and nico rosberg finished first and second respectively at the australian grand prix . hamilton races to victory in melbourne as mercedes dominance of formula one rolls on . the two mercedes team-mates celebrate their winning start to the new season with some champagne . __re-live__ every lap of the melbourne race . hamilton beat team-mate nico rosberg by 1.3 secs , with vettel third on his debut for ferrari , but __34.5__ secs off the pace . predicting ' a __two-horse__ race at every grand prix this year ' , horner has called on the fia to act to prevent an f1 yawn , and he is fully aware of how his comments will be viewed given red bull 's past success . ` when we were winning - and we were never winning to the advantage they have - i remember double __diffusers__ were banned , __exhausts__ were moved , flexible bodywork was prohibited , engine mapping mid-season was changed , ' said horner of the steps taken to negate his team 's performance . ` anything was done , and that was n't just unique to red bull , but williams in previous years and mclaren __etcetera__ . ` is it healthy to have this situation ? the fia , within the rules , have an __equalisation__ mechanism and it is perhaps something we need to look at . red bull chief christian horner is concerned that mercedes dominance will be unhealthy for the sport . horner 's red bull team won consecutive titles between __2010-2013__ with sebastian vettel behind the wheel . red bull driver daniil kvyat was forced to retire early in what was called a 's **** y weekend ' by horner . ` mercedes , take nothing away from them , they have done a great job and they have a good car , a fantastic engine , and two very good drivers . ` the problem is the gap is so big you end up with __three-tier__ racing and that 's not healthy for formula one . ` the fia have the facts and they could quite easily come up with some form of __equalisation__ otherwise i fear the interest will wane . ' i did n't see mercedes much on the tv , and i can only imagine that 's because it 's not interesting watching a procession and the producer was looking to pick out other battles in the race . ' referring to the fact hollywood star arnold schwarzenegger conducted the podium ceremony , horner added : ` the highlight for me was seeing arnie on the podium ! ' horner 's comments were borne out of exasperation at the job __power-unit__ supplier renault have done since the system came into force at the start of last season . the hope was renault would have closed the gap to mercedes over the winter , but instead they appear to have fallen further steps back . hollywood actor arnold schwarzenegger interviewed winner hamilton after the race in australia . the former governor of california raises a smile from third placed sebastian vettel now of ferrari . an angry horner , who saw daniil kvyat retire on the formation lap with a gearbox issue , said : ` it 's been a tough weekend and a very tough weekend for renault . ` the engine is quite __undriveable__ and you can see and hear that from the comments the drivers are making . ` they need to have a clear vision and they need it quickly because it 's frustrating we are effectively further back than we were in abu dhabi in both power and __driveability__ . ` it 's disappointing and been a s *** y sunday for us . we can only get better and get our heads down and work harder at it .

ARTICEL:     england 's campaign at the european under 21 championship looks set to be dominated over whether harry kane is included - but gareth southgate may not need him . in front of over 30,000 at the riverside stadium , england came from behind to defeat germany 3-2 and record a victory against not just old rivals but the pre-tournament favourites in the czech republic this summer . southgate is still expected to do everything he can to include the tottenham striker , but the win over germany shows that the young lions can go toe-to-toe with the cream of europe . here sportsmail looks at england 's three stand-out stars from the win in middlesbrough . james ward-prowse . the southampton star has already become an established member of the first team at st mary 's and is set to be a key member of southgate 's side in the czech republic . the 20-year-old scored the winner with a crisp low effort after __ghosting__ into the penalty box to find space . but his attacking play extends to set-pieces . germany 's julian __korb__ reaches out in vain as james ward-prowse fires home england 's winning goal . the under 21 captain celebrates his late strike following a fine midfield performance . in ward-prowse , england have potentially their best __dead-ball__ specialist since david beckham with his passing range and accurate shooting already a highlight of his game . ward-prowse was captain for the germany victory and his rapid progress on the south coast in the last two years suggests he is worth keeping an eye on . carl jenkinson . named the official man of the match , jenkinson put in a close to perfect performance - albeit he was slightly at fault for germany 's opening goal after allowing the cross for philipp __hofmann__ to fire home . but after a slow start to each half , the west ham full-back , on loan from arsenal , imposed himself down the right-hand side . carl jenkinson runs the ball out of defence for england as germany substitute nico schulz looks on . jenkinson put in a man of the match display having assisted two of england 's three goals . it was the 23-year-old 's cross for jesse lingard which helped draw the three lions level in the first half , while he also provided the pass for ward-prowse to tuck home the winning goal . with england 's senior team lacking depth in the right-back area , roy hodgson could do worse than pick jenkinson . because if he does n't , then finland will as he can still play for the scandinavian team . nathan redmond . relished the battle with germany full-back christian gunter , often managing to pull away from his marker to lead an attack down the right wing . redmond is not all about pace though as he often tried to cut inside to mix up his approach , with his passing in the final third managing to catch the german back four flat on a number of occasions . nathan redmond rifles home england 's second equaliser across goal into the bottom corner . redmond celebrates after drawing england level late in the game following an impressive display on the right . it was a much improved version of the winger who struggled in a poor norwich side in the premier league last season , but having struck the equaliser against a talented germany team he looks to be improving . now a veteran of the under 21 set-up , it will be difficult for southgate to leave him out of the side in the summer to help make space for kane as he has often impressed on the right wing for the young lions .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     england recorded impressive 3-2 win over germany in under 21 friendly . young lions twice came from behind to seal late win at riverside stadium . james ward-prowse , carl jenkinson and nathan redmond among stars . gareth southgate 's side look in strong shape heading to the european under 21 championship in czech republic this summer .

' gordon 's impassioned assertion was made during a dramatic intervention staged by dr phil last week and due to air today . weeping and wailing and at times incoherent , gordon had believed that he was to be interviewed by dr phil . gordon had told the eminent psychologist that he wanted to tell his side of the story . he has felt ` vilified ' and ` depicted as a monster ' since january 31 when bobby kristina , 22 , was found face down and unresponsive in the __bath-tub__ at the roswell , georgia home he and bobby kristina shared . breakdown : with his mother , michelle , by his side nick gordon struggles to stay coherent . troubling preview : a trailer for the interview of bobbi kristina brown 's boyfriend nick gordon by dr phil mcgraw was released sunday night . swinging from crying to flying into a rage , the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by dr phil . but on learning of gordon 's emotional , mental and physical state dr phil could not ` in good conscience ' go on with the interview . according to gordon 's mother , michelle , who was by her son 's side during the highly emotional intervention , ` nicholas is at a breaking point . he can not bear not being without __krissy__ , by her side . he 's dealing with it by drinking . i 've begged him to stop . ' dr phil told gordon , who admitted to having taken xanax and to have drunk heavily prior to the meeting : ` nick , you 're out of control . you 've threatened suicide . you deserved to get some help because if you do n't , you know you 're going to wind up dead . ' he added : ` you 've got to get yourself cleaned up . you got to man up and straighten up . ' yesterday dailymail.com revealed that , barely 12 hours before the dramatic encounter with dr phil , gordon was so drunk and high he was unable to walk . the disturbing scenes captured on video showed the true extent of a deterioration described by dr phil as ` exponential . ' in the show , due to broadcast wednesday , a weeping and wailing gordon admitted that he has twice tried to kill himself and confessed : ` i 'm so sorry for everything . ' asked if he still intended to kill himself he said : ` if anything happens to __krissi__ i will . ' he said : ` my pain is horrible . my heart hurts . i have panic attacks . ' in recent weeks gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of xanax , alcohol and prescription sleeping pills . gordon had agreed to meet with dr phil believing that he was there to be interviewed . according to dr phil : ` he felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster . ' instead , on learning of gordon 's rapidly deteriorating mental , emotional and physical state , the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab . dr phil stated : ' i do n't think he has any chance of turning this round . left to his own devices he will be dead within the week . ' gordon 's mother , michelle , was by her son 's side as he __alternated__ between compliant and aggressive -- at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed . she described her son as ` at breaking point . ' she said : ` he can not take too much more of not being able to see __kriss__ . he blames himself . he 's torn up and carrying guilt . ` he 's dealing with it by drinking . i 've begged him to stop . i 've tried to help him but he ca n't let go of the guilt .

' he added : ` his life absolutely hangs in the balance . ' questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of january 31st that led to bobbi kristina , 22 , ending up face down in her tub . just two days ago bobbi kristina 's aunt , __leolah__ brown , made a series of explosive facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had ` strong __evidene__ of foul play ' relating to gordon 's role in events . she posted : ` nick gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate ! especially to my family . moreover , he has done things to my niece that i never thought he had in him to do ! ' __leolah__ made her claims in response to being invited onto dr phil 's show . tough to watch : the young man sobs and shakes at times through the trailer . in her message she wrote : ` with all due respect , nick gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece ... . we have strong evidence of foul play . ' marks were found on her face and arms , marks that gordon has explained as the result of cpr which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived . and speaking to dr phil , gordon insisted : ' i did everything possible in the world to protect them -lsb- whitney and bobbi kristina -rsb- . ' railing against the decision by bobbi 's father , bobby brown , to ban him from his fiancée 's bedside at atlanta 's emory hospital , gordon said : ` my name will be the first she calls . ' according to his mother , michelle , gordon can not forgive himself for his ` failure ' to revive bobbi kristina . his guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier . ' i hate bobby brown ! ' his tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend 's father bobby brown , who has blocked him from seeing the 22-year-old in the hospital . ` are you drinking ? ' the emotional man 's anger only increases as dr. phil asks about nick 's sobriety . refuses to go : the 25-year-old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help . resigned : ultimately , gordon concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility . then , on 11 february 2012 , it was gordon who tried to resuscitate whitney when she was found unresponsive in her __bath-tub__ just hours before she was due to attend a grammy awards party . speaking to dr phil , michelle said : ` nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed whitney . ` he administered cpr -lsb- to whitney -rsb- and he called me when he was standing over her body . he could n't understand why he could n't revive her . he said , `` mommy why ? i could n't get the air into her lungs .

' their relationship was also very volatile . ` when whitney died nick was left with nothing , so he knew he had to control __krissi__ to get access to the money . she 'd do whatever he told her . ` he was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her . they would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around . ' according to __stepho__ : ` but __krissi__ really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother . she was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her . nick knew this and took advantage of it .

ARTICEL:     the missing philae space probe that bumped down onto the surface of a comet 284 million miles from earth could wake up from today . scientists at the european space agency have restarted efforts to listen for a signal from the stricken lander on comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko . they lost contact with the __washing-machine__ sized spacecraft in november last year after it bounced several times before landing in a hollow below a cliff . starved of the sunlight it needed to power its suite of experiments , the lander 's batteries went flat after around just 60 hours on the surface . esa scientists have renewed efforts to contact the philae lander on comet 67p , shown in the illustration above . however , as the comet has travelled closer to the sun in its journey through the solar system , researchers hope philae will get enough light to come back to life . the rosetta probe , which was carrying philae , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of earth and mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67p . it chased comet __67p/churyumov__ -- __gerasimenko__ through space for more than ten years , and entered orbit in august 2014 . after a four billion mile -lrb- 6.5 billion km -rrb- journey , the probe then successfully released the philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 1 metre -lrb- 40 inches -rrb- per second relative to the comet . but when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet . this resulted in it bouncing to a height of __0.62__ miles -lrb- 1km -rrb- above the comet before again landing on the surface . it then bounced again , but to a much lower altitude . scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid , not a comet . the european space agency has now turned on the communication unit on the rosetta spacecraft that is orbiting the comet . stephen __ulamec__ , lander project manager at the german aerospace centre -lrb- __dlr__ -rrb- , said : ` philae currently receives about twice as much solar energy as it did in november last year . ` it will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up , but it is worth trying . the prospects will improve with each passing day . ' comet 67p is now 186 million miles -lrb- 300 million km -rrb- from the sun . scientists hope that as the comet rotates and gets closer to the sun , philae 's solar panels will move out of the shade of the cliff it is resting under . philae touched down on 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko on 12 november , but rather than landing softly , the failure of its harpoons and thrusters saw it bounce twice . it first bounced to a height of __0.62__ miles -lrb- 1km -rrb- and then 65ft -lrb- 20 metres -rrb- before finally coming to rest at an angle on uneven ground . blurry images captured the the spacecraft movement through the air . scientists described the comet 's surface as being more like a trampoline , causing the probe to rebound so far . it is thought the probe settled in a ditch beneath a cliff after bouncing more than half a mile from its original landing site . the rosetta orbiter took a number of images of philae as it bounced , with its final suspected resting place in the top right . however , further attempts to find the lander at the foot of the cliff have failed to find the probe . the __duck-shaped__ comet __67p/churyumove-geraismenko__ is moving closer to the sun and warming up as it does . this image sent back by the philae lander shows one of its three feet next to what appears to be a cliff face . scientist have been pouring over photographs of the landing area using the __mothership__ rosetta in an attempt to find the missing probe . philae was able to send back a photograph - the first taken from the surface of a comet - of an __overhanging__ cliff face that is thought to be obscuring the lander . before its batteries finally ran out , philae managed to send back data on the few experiments it was able to conduct along with some images . among the discoveries to have been released so far is that the comet 's surface appears to be made of a very hard ` __sintered__ ' ice . this graphic shows how philae bounced twice after it failed to anchor itself to the surface of the comet . researchers also revealed that they had found organic molecules - the basic building blocks of life . from several miles above the comet , rosetta has also continued to provide a constant stream of images and data since it arrived . but there are some fears that dust thrown up by the landing and movement of the comet itself could have covered the lander 's solar panels . this would mean it may struggle to get enough light to power its communication units and the experiments it is carrying on board . the image above is a composite of four pictures taken by the rosetta probe while flying 12 miles above the surface of the 2.4 mile wide comet 67p and shows the dramatic landscape that surrounds the __philea__ lander . comet 67p is due to reach its closest point to the sun in august this year and this is when scientists believe they have the best chance of hearing back from the stricken lander . philae requires its internal temperature to reach at least __-45__ degrees c before it can wake up . it will also require at least 5.5 watts from its solar panels to wake up . once awake , philae will turn on its receiver every 30 minutes and listens for a signal from the rosetta orbiter . __koen__ __guerts__ , part of the philae lander team at the __dlr__ control centre , said the probe may have already woken up but is yet to send a signal home . he said : ` philae is designed so that , since november 2014 , it has been using all the available solar energy to heat up . ' ` at this time , we do not yet know that the lander is __awake.to__ send us an answer , philae must also turn its transmitter -- and that requires additional power . ' this blurry image captures the moment philae bounced from the comet 's surface after failing to anchor itself . rosetta captured a __mothership__ 's view of philae as it descended to the surface of comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko on 12 november 2014 before losing contact with the probe after it bounced twice on the surface . philae needs a total of 19 watts to begin operating and allow two-way communication . over the next eight days the rosetta orbiter is due to transmit signals to its lander and listen for the response during a series of 11 __flybys__ . engineers have also sent new commands to the lander to __optimise__ the heating and provide energy savings to improve its chances of communication with earth . once philae wakes up and can also transmit , it will first send data about its ` health ' to earth . the scientific work with the 10 instruments on board philae also depends on these results . if sufficient energy can not be stored in the battery , the solar energy available during the comet daytime will determine whether a reduced version of the measurements can be performed . currently , scientists believe that philae is in sunlight for 1.3 hours - just a fraction of the 12.4 hour long day that the comet enjoys . mr __ulamec__ added : ` once we can communicate with philae again , the scientific work can begin . '
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     european space agency has begun attempting to contact the lost probe . philae has been missing since november when it landed on comet 67p . scientists believe the lander bounced into a ditch in the shade of a cliff . but they say it may already be awake but not yet able to send messages . the probe needs 19 watts of power from its solar panels to communicate . as the comet gets closer to the sun the lander may receive more sunlight . scientists have sent commands to philae for it to begin warming itself up . they will attempt to contact the lander with rosetta over the next 8 days .

ARTICEL:     true meaning of easter : the eggs were backed by archbishop of york john sentamu , who is urging the supermarkets to rethink . supermarkets have been accused of pursuing an ` __anti-__ christian agenda ' after refusing to sell easter eggs with a religious message . some of britain 's biggest stores are celebrating the most profound event in the church calendar by offering treats featuring everything from darth vader to postman pat -- but turned down products that mention jesus . one chain even asked ` what has easter got to do with the church ? ' , according to the makers of the real easter egg , which features christian crosses on the box and contain a leaflet telling the story of the resurrection . now archbishop of york john sentamu has stepped in -- urging sainsbury 's , asda and the co-op to stock the charity eggs -- while former archbishop of canterbury george carey said he was ` saddened ' by the three supermarket giants ' decision . lord carey said : ` the rest are rubbish . these easter eggs that have nothing to do with easter , all they are trying to do is get more money out of people . they have no meaning . i think it shows ignorance on the part of these supermarkets . ` by not offering an alternative to secular easter eggs they are really undermining the real message of easter . it saddens me because we are living in a land that is completely losing contact with its religious roots and is out of touch with the christian message . ' david marshall , the head of the meaningful chocolate company , said the supermarkets appeared biased against its ` proven seller ' . he said : ` we do wonder at times if there is an __anti-christian__ agenda from some of our supermarkets who just keep turning it down . it is as if some feel christianity is politically incorrect or the easter story , which mentions jesus , might put people off . ` one buyer asked us what easter had got to do with the church , while another simply said , `` i do n't think this is a credible product '' and asked us to leave . ' the __warrington-based__ firm has spent five years trying to persuade stores to sell its # 4 __christian-themed__ eggs , which were launched in 2010 with the backing of archbishop sentamu . at first the supermarkets refused , but two years ago , tesco , morrisons , sainsbury 's , waitrose and the co-op bowed to pressure and agreed . but this year sainsbury 's and the co-op have dropped the eggs , blaming poor sales , while asda has never stocked them . however , the meaningful chocolate company say a million eggs have been sold over the past five years . ` poor sales ' : sainsbury 's and co-op have cited poor sales as the reason they dropped the eggs , while asda said it has not be approached by the makers of the egg . archbishop sentamu , who has lamented ignorance about easter after learning that a third of children thought it marked the birthday of the easter bunny , said yesterday : ` with a million real easter eggs sold i am delighted that morrisons , tesco and waitrose have met the challenge . i call on sainsbury 's , asda , and the co-operative to give their customers the same choice . ' sainsbury 's said their decision was based on ` the popularity of ranges in previous years ' , with the co-op also citing ` poor sales of the real easter egg in previous years ' . asda said it had not been approached this year , a claim disputed by the meaningful chocolate company .

ARTICEL:     mental health checks in the civil aviation industry lack the rigour needed , a former ba pilot has claimed in the wake of this week 's __germanwings__ disaster . alastair __rosenschein__ , now an aviation consultant , made the comments after it was revealed co-pilot andreas __lubitz__ hid an illness from his employers and crashed the plane into a mountain killing 149 people on board . ` this recent accident demonstrates that the mental health checks lack the rigour that is specifically required in a safety sensitive industry like civil aviation , ' he said . scroll down for video . killer in the cockpit : andreas __lubitz__ - pictured competing in a half-marathon in 2013 - was reportedly in the middle of a ` relationship crisis ' when he crashed the __germanwings__ airliner into the alps , killing himself and 149 others . german detectives were also pictured carrying computer equipment from __lubitz__ 's family home in the small town north of frankfurt . potential breakthrough : german detectives carry evidence boxes from the 28-year-old 's apartment on the outskirts of dusseldorf on thursday . yesterday , the boss of __germanwings__ admitted __lubitz__ had slipped through the ` safety net ' and should never have been flying . and today it was discovered the co-pilot hid an illness from his employers . following a search of his dusseldorf apartment , investigators revealed they had found __torn-up__ sick leave notes - current ones and one issued for the day of the disaster . __lubitz__ locked the pilot out of the airbus a320 's cockpit before setting the plane 's controls to descend into a rocky valley , french prosecutors said yesterday . he had previously been signed off from training with depression in 2008 and was reportedly receiving mental health support up until tuesday 's crash . the 28-year-old was also in the middle of the ` relationship crisis ' with his girlfriend in the weeks before the crash and may have been struggling to cope with a break-up , german newspaper bild reported . it was claimed this morning that the couple may have previously been engaged to be married next year . mr __rosenschein__ , who was previously a researcher at the institute of psychiatry at king 's college london , added : ` the safety net has a very wide mesh and that mesh needs to be narrowed . ` __athough__ suicide among pilots is not uncommon , murder-suicide is extremely rare . ' slipped through the net : __germanwings__ co-pilot andreas __lubitz__ had suffered from depression and ` burnout ' which had held up his career . investigators enter __lubitz__ 's house on the outskirts of dusseldorf yesterday as the probe into the crash continues . in a blunt admission , __carsten__ __spohr__ , the head of lufthansa , which owns the budget airline , admitted __lubitz__ had slipped through the safety net . ` the pilot had passed all his tests , all his medical exams , ' he said . ` he was 100 per cent fit to fly without any restrictions . ` we have at lufthansa , a reporting system where crew can report -- without being punished -- their own problems , or they can report about the problems of others without any kind of punishment . ` all the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case . ' __lubitz__ passed one of the most rigorous assessments when he was accepted for flight training by lufthansa , according to the telegraph . the airline said __lubitz__ trained at the lufthansa flight training school in bremen . an assessment required by germany 's civil aviation authority , the __dlr__ , plus standards imposed by lufthansa were needed before he was accepted . however , although the process includes __psychometric__ testing of the candidate 's ability to work under pressure and handle stress , they do not examine personality or lifestyle more closely , the telegraph reported . lufthansa , like other airlines , does not operate a formal vetting process for aspiring pilots . investigation : french prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation for what appears to be a case of suicide involving mass murder . search : teams working in the difficult alpine terrain clear scattered crash debris and search for bodies and belongings . debris from the jet , operated by lufthansa 's __germanwings__ budget airline , was found near __barcelonnette__ . new information about __lubitz__ 's life emerged just hours after police investigating the disaster began a four-hour search of his flat , which he is said to have shared with a girlfriend . officers found ` evidence of mental illness ' but no suicide note , der spiegel reported . it is understood detectives have found significant material on __lubitz__ 's computer , which they are now carefully examining for any explanation for his terrible actions . he reportedly received a year and half of psychiatric treatment and was at one point recommended to be examined by a doctor before flying . however , he passed his psychological assessments and was later considered fit to fly . germany 's federal aviation office confirmed this morning that __lubitz__ had a medical condition noted in his pilot 's records which required him to have a regular examination . doctors giving pilots their regular medical checks assess their psychological __soundness__ at the same time , according to the uk 's civil aviation authority . this is done before they first fly and at regular intervals after that -- once a year for __under-40s__ and every six months for those over that age . pilots are not made to sit detailed psychological tests , but the doctors are qualified to spot problems including signs of stress , fatigue and drug or alcohol abuse . caa standards state : ` during assessment of the applicant 's history , the doctor should make a general inquiry about mental health , which may include mood , sleep and alcohol use . ` the doctor should observe the applicant during the process of the examination and assess the mental state of the applicant .

ARTICEL:     when a legendary figure like pat jennings says none of the other __1,097__ matches in his career was comparable with the 1979 fa cup final between arsenal and manchester united , you know it was something special . forever known as wembley 's ` five-minute final ' , arsenal threw away and then regained the trophy in an incredible late sequence that saw them squander a 2-0 lead going into the 86th minute before winning 3-2 in the final moments with a goal that put alan sunderland 's name in fa cup folklore . it created a superstar in arsenal 's man-of-the-match liam brady and broke the career of manchester united manager dave sexton . pat jennings -lrb- left -rrb- and pat rice pose with the fa cup after the dramatic wembley final of 1979 . jennings reacts after conceding a goal as manchester united fought back to level the scores at 2-2 . but alan sunderland scored the winning goal for arsenal to write his name into cup folklore . victorious captain pat rice was so drained and overcome with emotion as he climbed the famous 39 steps to finally lift the trophy , he delivered an unwitting snub to the famous royal guest of honour . rice recalls : ` prince charles was there to present the trophy . he said , ` congratulations ' as we shook hands but as soon as i saw the cup , i turned around to lift it up to the arsenal fans . ' i did n't realise he was still waiting to give me my medal . it was only when i turned back , i saw him with it in his hand . it must have looked insulting but it was n't meant like that . eager is the polite way of putting it . just a couple of minutes before i 'd been out on the pitch thinking ` f *** , we 've blown it ' . ' sammy mcilroy , who had scored united 's dramatic equaliser on a baking hot may afternoon , says the impact of the game has not diminished with time . ` it 's 36 years on and people still ask me about it every week , ' he adds __ruefully__ . ` they always want to know about that final rather than the one we won against liverpool two years earlier . ' united and arsenal meet again in the fa cup on monday in a quarter-final at old trafford but it is impossible that wayne rooney and alexis sanchez will grip the nation like their predecessors did . ` there has not been a final before or since with the twists and turns of that game , ' says brady , who helped set up the winning goal when arsenal were on their knees reeling from mcilroy 's equaliser . ' i played two short of 1,100 games and i have never known four minutes like that , ' adds jennings , a gentle giant of a goalkeeper who otherwise stayed unflappable in a 23-year career with watford , spurs , arsenal and northern ireland . sammy mcilroy -lrb- left -rrb- scored united 's equaliser against arsenal in the dramatic 79 cup final . alexis sanchez -lrb- left -rrb- of arsenal and wayne rooney -lrb- right -rrb- of manchester united will lock horns on monday . the 1979 showpiece took place eight days after margaret thatcher had been elected great britain 's first female prime minister and given the prestige of the fa cup final in those days , the two events seemed equally important at the time . a full house of 100,000 and a tv audience of 15 million was guaranteed . united travelled to their team hotel a full three days before the match to fulfil the insatiable demands of the press , photographers and television cameras , with bbc and itv planning their entire saturday schedules around the final . then , as now , arsenal and united were big clubs in transition . arsenal had not won a trophy for eight years , while united were rebuilding after the glory days of george best , denis law and bobby charlton . they had been relegated to the second division five years earlier . both sets of supporters flocked down wembley way convinced good times were about to return for their club . for 85 minutes , the match appeared routine , with brian talbot scoring for arsenal after 12 minutes and frank stapleton adding to it with a __43rd-minute__ header . the only talking point was over who should be credited with the opening goal -- talbot or sunderland , who appeared to connect at the same time . ' i know it was mine . i 've got a picture on my trophy cabinet showing me kicking the ball and alan kicking my boot , ' says talbot . with arsenal leading 2-0 going into the final minutes , complacency crept in . ` it was unprofessional but i met eyes with liam as if to say , ` yes , we 've won it ' , ' says graham __rix__ . ` we were coasting , comfortable , ' adds talbot . even the experienced jennings says : ' i was imagining myself going up the steps . ' brian talbot -lrb- right -rrb- opened the scoring for arsenal after only 12 minutes in the cup final against united . gordon mcqueen -lrb- fifth left -rrb- pulled a goal back in the 86th minute to give united hope . then , with just five minutes left , arsenal boss terry neill decided to send on substitute steve walford for david price as a thank-you for his performances in earlier rounds . it backfired disastrously . out of nowhere , in the 86th minute , gordon mcqueen drove in a loose ball from a set piece to make it 2-1 . just 106 second later , mcilroy __jinked__ past david o'leary and walford before __toepoking__ past an onrushing jennings to equalise . pandemonium ensued in the stadium as arsenal fell apart . ' i knew the cameras were on me so i put on my best acting , trying to look concerned but not terribly worried , ' says neill . ` in reality , my insides were going up and down . ' reflecting now , mcilroy says : ` the arsenal boys were gone , on their knees . if we 'd taken it into extra-time , we would have won . ' i went crazy , i could have run out of wembley and back in again after that goal . after the game , bob bishop -lsb- the scout from northern ireland who discovered both mcilroy and best -rsb- told me we 'd celebrated too long , we should have gone back to the halfway line and concentrated . ` he was probably right but it was not what we wanted to hear after throwing it away . ' at 2-2 , united were now red-hot favourites but what happened from the restart is part of fa cup legend . brady surged into the united half past mickey thomas , then past lou __macari__ , and slipped a ball to __rix__ on the left . frank stapleton in possession for arsenal in the cup final against united at wembley in 1979 . liam brady -lrb- left -rrb- , frank stapleton -lrb- centre -rrb- and david o'leary -lrb- right -rrb- were in arsenal 's winning squad . __rix__ , a 21-year-old from a south yorkshire pit village , delivered a cross that __arced__ away from united goalkeeper gary bailey , leaving sunderland the chance to score from close-range . the picture of the __bouffant-haired__ forward running away in total ecstasy chased by the __most-relieved__ substitute in history , walford , remains an iconic image . ` when i picked up the ball , i was initially just trying to get the ball away from our goal , ' says brady . ' i went past one challenge , two challenges and i was in the final third and i saw graham outside me . ' __rix__ takes up the story . ' i did n't know sunderland was at the far post , my only thought was to take the cross away from the goalkeeper . it was something i 'd trained on with -lsb- coach -rsb- don howe all those wet and windy wednesday nights : keep it out of the keeper 's grasp . ' sunderland says : ' i went into __auto-pilot__ and when the ball went it , the pent-up emotion came out . ' just two minutes , 59 seconds had elapsed between the three goals and history had been made . more than 250,000 arsenal fans greeted the team 's heroes in islington the following day . the arsenal players collected bonuses nearly three times their # __1,000-a-week__ wages but for some the long-term rewards turned out to be far greater . brady 's performances against juventus in the following season 's european __cup-winners__ ' cup persuaded the italian giants to sign him and he blazed a trail for many other first division stars like ray wilkins and paul gascoigne to go to serie a. for united , being a runner-up was not good enough and sexton was sacked within two years . ` he was unlucky , if we 'd won the final , he would have been given more time , ' says thomas , a comment that will be of interest to louis van gaal . more than 250,000 supporters came out to greet arsenal the day after their fa cup triumph . arsenal parade the trophy around wembley after securing a dramatic victory over united . arsenal 's class of __'79__ still meet up for reunions at the emirates and rice will be at old trafford tomorrow with the club 's board of directors . ' i still remember the elation , ' says the former arsenal captain . ` when __sundy__ scored , i thought , ` right , we 're not going to bloody lose this again ' . ' if monday 's tie produces just a quarter of the late drama of ' 79 , it will be a thriller .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     pat jennings feels the 1979 fa cup final was the best game of his career . arsenal won 3-2 but lost a two goal lead in the 86th and 88th minute . alan sunderland then scored arsenal 's winner in the 89th minute .

ARTICEL:     school children around the country will be watching tomorrow 's __once-in-a-decade__ solar eclipse on tv due to safety fears . britain will be thrown into partial darkness around 9.30 am tomorrow morning as the moon passes in front of the sun , blocking out up to 98 per cent of its light . but many schools are keeping children indoors when the phenomenon takes place because of fears they could damage their eyes by looking at the sun . the decision by head teachers has angered parents , who want their children to experience the rare celestial event without sitting in front of a screen . pupils at a number of schools around britain will be kept indoors tomorrow during the solar eclipse over fears they may damage their eyes by looking at the sun . file photo . those living in some parts of britain may not see the eclipse due to the cloudy weather which is forecast . mother-of-two jen palmer , from worthing , west sussex , tweeted : ` hands up who is __rebelling__ against school rules tomorrow and sending their kids in late having watched the eclipse ? ' and paul __towner__ , a father from reading , berkshire , wrote : ` should i take my son to school late so he can watch the eclipse ? they are watching it on tv ! ' isabel stevenson , a mother-of-four from glasgow , added : ` so not happy about secondary school my kids go to doing nothing for solar eclipse tomorrow ! livid and furious . i 'm on a mission today . ' she has set up a petition calling on her children 's school , __greenfaulds__ high school in __cumbernauld__ , to do more to mark the occasion . the petition states : ' i have been told by the school that they are doing nothing for the event . ` pupils who are absent from class will be penalised as normal , and the school has no plans in place for viewing the eclipse as it happens , either by video , or by projection . ` pupils with solar viewing glasses will not be allowed to go outside and use them . ' -lsb- the school -rsb- is dismissing the value that witnessing this rare astronomical event will have on many pupils and it goes against the idea that school is a place of education . ' parents in other areas say they have been left running around after schools only announced today that children would have to bring their own ` __eclipse-viewing__ glasses ' . the decision has caused anger among parents , who do not want their children to miss out on the event . pupils around britain also went online to complain after some were told the blinds in their classrooms would be closed during the eclipse and others said they would be shown a recording of the event in the afternoon . __oldway__ primary school in paignton , devon , is another one of those which has come under fire for keeping children inside , where they will watch it on computer screens . parent sophie __bertorelli__ said : ` it is a bit of a shame to watch it on a computer . i would have thought they would have maybe supplied some protective glasses . ' head teacher jane smythe said she had 700 children to look after and she ` could not guarantee that they would not look at the sun ' . ms smythe said she understood if parents wanted to keep children at home for the first hour of school so they could watch it together . the school is not the only one to make the decision . the __penryn__ primary academy cornwall says it is broadcasting the event for children in the school hall , __lasswade__ primary school in __bonnyrigg__ , midlothian are also keeping students indoors and bishop __vesey__ 's grammar school in birmingham is screening it on tv in the afternoon to all but year 7 students , who will be allowed outside . __oldway__ primary school in paignton , devon , is keeping pupils inside . its headteacher , jane smythe -lrb- left -rrb- says she can not guarantee pupils will not look at the sun . some parent 's have back the decision . fiona __bullman__ , in paignton , told the bbc : ` it 's too much of a risk . you ca n't risk 700 children potentially being blinded . unless there 's one adult to one child , you ca n't -lsb- risk it -rsb- . ' the department for education has said what schools do for the eclipse is a matter for individual head teachers to decide . would you let your child watch the solar eclipse ? would you let your child watch the solar eclipse ? now share your opinion . looking at the sun either with naked eyes or through __unfiltered__ binoculars or telescopes can permanently damage people 's eyesight . those who want to look at the occurrence are being advised to use __pin-hole__ projectors or glasses with special filters . it is feared clouds could also ruin viewing of the eclipse , with overcast skies forecast for much of the south west of england . northern cities such as lancaster , york and newcastle should have sunnier days and scotland , where the eclipse will conceal almost 98 per cent of the sun in places , will be largely clear . a met office spokeswoman said : ` forecasting exactly where cloud will break and reform is really not scientifically possible . but it 's not as thick in the south as further north , so you 're more likely to see breaks in the cloud the further south you are . ' it is not unknown for a fleeting break in cloud to occur during an eclipse as the atmosphere cools . another ` deep ' partial eclipse visible in the uk will not occur until august 12 , 2026 , and the next total eclipse not until september __2090__ . tomorrow 's eclipse will produce a __100-mile-wide__ ` totality ' shadow path that crosses the north atlantic and covers only two land masses , the faroe islands between scotland and iceland and the norwegian archipelago of svalbard . astronomer gemma lavender from all about space magazine . do you need special equipment to look at the eclipse ? ` it 's all too easy to look at the sun when an eclipse is happening , but you should never look at the eclipse with naked eyes , binoculars or a telescope without filters - otherwise you run the risk of permanently damaging your eyesight . ` that 's not to say that you ca n't watch the eclipse on friday - but you should ensure that you have the right equipment that will provide you with the right amount of protection . ` dedicated telescopes such as solar telescopes can allow you to observe the eclipse with absolutely no risk . however , unless you already own one , know somebody who does or are looking to get into solar astronomy , they can be a massive investment of several hundred pounds . ` there are cheaper ways to observe the eclipse , though . ' are solar glasses fine to use ? ` many people buy solar glasses or viewers to watch the eclipse . these can be bought quite cheaply from telescope dealers . ` they work by employing a __mylar__ film that blocks out over 99 per cent of the sun 's light , allowing you to view the eclipse safely . ` before using them though , you should make sure that they are not damaged in any way and you should ensure that you have bought them from a reputable dealer . if you 're in doubt , do n't use your viewers at all . ' how can you use a telescope to observe the eclipse ? ` if you own a telescope , then there are several ways for you to observe the eclipse . ` if you do n't own them already , it is possible for you to buy a solar filter , which covers the aperture of your telescope to ensure that you can observe the sun safely . the movement of the sun and moon means the eclipse will be seen at different times around the uk . ` they are found to be made of glass or as with the solar glasses , __mylar__ film . it is possible to make a solar filter using __mylar__ sheets but caution is advised while making your own solar filter - any scratches or __pinholes__ will lead to dangerous amount of sunlight entering your eyes . ` you should also avoid relying on __eyepiece__ filters - they can not handle the sun 's light . ` telescope projection is also a safe way to observe the eclipse . by using two large , white pieces of card , you can project the eclipse 's image onto one piece , while using the other to fit around your telescope 's tube to act as a mask to shield your eyes from the sun . ` focusing your telescope 's __eyepiece__ , while holding the second card away , which projects the image , will enable you to show the eclipse to a large group of people safely . ` you should not use a cheap , plastic telescope for telescope projection and ensure that your __finderscope__ has its cap on . ` never look at the eclipse whilst lining up your telescope with the sun and never leave your telescope unattended . you should also ensure that your instrument does n't overheat . ' can you use household items to view the eclipse ? ` if you do n't have a standard telescope or have forgotten to buy a solar viewer , then there are several household items you can use so that you do n't miss out on seeing this fantastic event . ` using a piece of card , or anything that has small holes punched into it , you can project the eclipse onto another piece of card . this is certainly one of the safest ways of viewing the eclipse since you do n't need to look at the sun at all . ' a washing up bowl or bucket can also be lined with a black bin liner and then filled with water to make a reflective surface to safely watch the eclipse . when and where will the eclipse be visible ? ` the eclipse will begin in the morning . for observers in the uk , the eclipse starts at 8.30 am , peaks at __9.35__ am and ends at __10.41__ am , so you should make sure that you know where the sun rises from your location . ` the total solar eclipse - that 's 100 per cent of the sun 's surface covered by the moon - is visible from the faroe islands and svalbard but if you are unable to get to these locations , many are able to see a substantial partial eclipse - for instance , scotland will see around 90 per cent of the sun 's disc covered by the moon . ' how dark will it get in the uk ? ` in london and even in places where there 's 90 per cent sun coverage , we 're not really going to notice any changes in brightness because there 's still a portion of the sun 's surface uncovered . ` it 'll be like there 's a cloud passing over the sun - you know it 's cloudy but it 's still light . ' this map of the uk shows where the eclipse will be visible and what time it will reach its peak .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     moon will pass in front of sun tomorrow creating 98 % eclipse in some parts . the event due to take place at 9.30 am , meaning children will be at school . parents angry after some headteachers decide to keep youngsters indoors . school chiefs say they will not risk children 's eyesight from looking at sun .

' i do not trust in people who say that they do not have regrets . ` in my opinion , there is a difference between not having regrets and not thinking about them . ` not thinking about regrets is better , because what you have done is in the past .

but for the sloppy __back-pass__ which almost caught out de gea in opening minutes . 6.5 . daley blind : splendid first half , raiding forward from left-back to link up with ashley young as united tore spurs apart before half-time . good delivery from wide . 7 . michael carrick : took a grip of the game with two instances of __clear-minded__ wit in the first half : a pass for fellaini 's opener and a goal with his head to make it 2-0 . 8.5 . juan mata : like carrick making his first premier league start for two months , playing wide on the right where he often struggles to cover the ground . added some silky touches . 6.5 . michael carrick heads the ball back across goal to put united two goals up after some poor spurs defending . carrick , who also created united 's first goal for marouane fellaini , was the best player on the pitch . ander herrera : supplied good energy , invention and forward thrust from midfield and a key to success of the formation . 6.5 . marouane fellaini : huge first-half contribution . spurs could not cope with him . one well-taken goal with his left foot and a key header in second . 7.5 . ashley young : excellent reminder of his acceleration and trickery on the left-wing . tormented walker in the first half as united won the game . 7.5 . fellaini celebrates putting united into the lead with a well-placed finish in the ninth minute of the game . wayne rooney : mobile and tireless , with wonderful vision to link up with his midfield runners . scored a fabulous goal and may have had more . 8 . subs : pereira for mata -lrb- 79 min -rrb- premier league debut . falcao for fellaini -lrb- 83 -rrb- . rafael for carrick -lrb- 87 -rrb- . manager : louis van gaal : having started the season trying to cram as many attackers onto the pitch as possible , this 4-1-4-1 shape had a pleasing balance . 7 . rooney slots away after being handed the ball by lacklustre nabil bentaleb in the opening 45 . louis van gaal waves to the manchester united fans after a game where he finally found his team 's balance . tottenham . hugo lloris : badly exposed by his team in the first-half . little he could do with any of the goals , but unable to save spurs this time . 6 . kyle walker : torrid opening 45 minutes when he could not contain the first-half threat of young and blind on united 's left . not helped by his midfield 4 . eric dier : beaten in air by fellaini for united second . easily __side-stepped__ by rooney for the third . easier after the break when united cruised . 4.5 . jan vertonghen : perhaps the only one of the defensive unit to escape with a little credit . even so , not able to keep united at bay . 6 . the spurs defenders look shell-shocked at the half-time whistle after being completely __over-run__ . danny rose : not the result or performance he would have wanted in front of england boss roy hodgson , but most of the damage done by united on the other side . 5.5 . ryan mason : appeared overwhelmed by united 's intensity and the thrust of fellaini and herrera . dragged right to help with young and blind , left holes for fellaini to exploit . 5 . nabil bentaleb : like mason , found it impossible to get any sort of grip on the game in midfield . awful mistake for the third goal . 5 . andros townsend : a torrid half-hour . he supplied precious little protection for walker and enjoyed little quality possession to attack . hooked as pochettino __reshuffled__ . 4 . andros townsend was withdrawn in the first half after a torrid first 30 minutes in manchester . townsend can not bear to look as he sits on the old trafford bench after being replaced so early on . christian eriksen : __flickers__ of magic from the dane were absent . a victim of tottenham 's inability to secure possession . 5 . nacer chadli : poor clearance gave carrick chance to score the second . __swtiched__ to the right after townsend subbed to provide more __solidity__ , which he did . 5.5 . harry kane : a difficult afternoon in front of hodgson . ran hard as ever but was isolated and starved of the ball and it was the 89th minute before he tested de gea . 5 . subs : dembele for townsend -lrb- 31 -rrb- helped make spurs a little more solid 5 ; lamela for mason -lrb- 64 -rrb- minimal influence 4 , adebayor for chadli -lrb- 79 -rrb- out of exile to little effect . mauricio pochettino may have made an early chance , but it was already too late for tottenham on sunday . manger : mauricio pochettino : his team were stunned by united 's intense start and slow to adjust until he sent on dembele for townsend , by when it was too late . 5 . referee : mark clattenburg : back at old trafford for manchester united v spurs a decade after missing the pedro mendes goal which crossed the line . this experience was far less controversial . 7 .

' i knew him at coventry . i remember watching him and thought when i came into the job he will be a good one to bring in and give us a bit of energy . unfortunately because of his medical condition he wo n't be able to play for us . __bigirimana__ signed on loan for rangers alongside haris __vuckic__ -lrb- middle -rrb- and __remie__ __streete__ . ` but that is as big a blow to the kid as it is for us . it 's not his fault , this -lsb- row -rsb- has been nothing to do with him . he comes in with a smile on his face each morning , he trains with the fitness coach as hard as he possibly can . ` so as disappointed as we are that we ca n't use him , you have to think of the boy in this matter because he ca n't go back , he ca n't play for anyone else . ` it 's an unfortunate circumstance that really should never have happened . ' llambias - a close associate of magpies owner mike ashley - signed off on the five newcastle loan deals just hours before the january transfer window shut , but did not ask club doctors to check the players over . so far only slovenian playmaker haris __vuckic__ has played regularly . __bigirimana__ says he knew he was ill before he moved to rangers . defender __remie__ __streete__ limped off just half an hour into his debut and has not been seen since , while northern ireland winger shane ferguson has yet to even step foot inside murray park after being ruled out for the rest of the season with a serious knee injury . swiss defender kevin __mbabu__ has featured for rangers ' youth side but is ` nowhere ' near being fit enough for first-team duty , according to mccall . the __gers__ boss cans sympathise with the players but hit out at the previous regime 's decision to sanction some of the signings . rangers boss stuart mccall says he feels sorry for newcastle loanee __bigirimana__ . mccall said : ` should these guys ever have been sent here ? well , with __bigi__ being unable to play that 's a no-brainer . with shane , he was on his way back but had a little setback . ` but i think if you look at it in all honesty , anybody who comes up for a six-month loan should have a medical - obviously that is not the case . ` if that had occurred , two or three of the loans may not have happened . ` but none of the players are at fault here . shane has not been up but the rest come in and train as hard as they can . they are doing their utmost to be involved .

ARTICEL:     school children around the country will be watching tomorrow 's __once-in-a-decade__ solar eclipse on tv due to safety fears . britain will be thrown into partial darkness around 9.30 am tomorrow morning as the moon passes in front of the sun , blocking out up to 98 per cent of its light . but many schools are keeping children indoors when the phenomenon takes place because of fears they could damage their eyes by looking at the sun . the decision by head teachers has angered parents , who want their children to experience the rare celestial event without sitting in front of a screen . pupils at a number of schools around britain will be kept indoors tomorrow during the solar eclipse over fears they may damage their eyes by looking at the sun . file photo . those living in some parts of britain may not see the eclipse due to the cloudy weather which is forecast . mother-of-two jen palmer , from worthing , west sussex , tweeted : ` hands up who is __rebelling__ against school rules tomorrow and sending their kids in late having watched the eclipse ? ' and paul __towner__ , a father from reading , berkshire , wrote : ` should i take my son to school late so he can watch the eclipse ? they are watching it on tv ! ' isabel stevenson , a mother-of-four from glasgow , added : ` so not happy about secondary school my kids go to doing nothing for solar eclipse tomorrow ! livid and furious . i 'm on a mission today . ' she has set up a petition calling on her children 's school , __greenfaulds__ high school in __cumbernauld__ , to do more to mark the occasion . the petition states : ' i have been told by the school that they are doing nothing for the event . ` pupils who are absent from class will be penalised as normal , and the school has no plans in place for viewing the eclipse as it happens , either by video , or by projection . ` pupils with solar viewing glasses will not be allowed to go outside and use them . ' -lsb- the school -rsb- is dismissing the value that witnessing this rare astronomical event will have on many pupils and it goes against the idea that school is a place of education . ' parents in other areas say they have been left running around after schools only announced today that children would have to bring their own ` __eclipse-viewing__ glasses ' . the decision has caused anger among parents , who do not want their children to miss out on the event . pupils around britain also went online to complain after some were told the blinds in their classrooms would be closed during the eclipse and others said they would be shown a recording of the event in the afternoon . __oldway__ primary school in paignton , devon , is another one of those which has come under fire for keeping children inside , where they will watch it on computer screens . parent sophie __bertorelli__ said : ` it is a bit of a shame to watch it on a computer . i would have thought they would have maybe supplied some protective glasses . ' head teacher jane smythe said she had 700 children to look after and she ` could not guarantee that they would not look at the sun ' . ms smythe said she understood if parents wanted to keep children at home for the first hour of school so they could watch it together . the school is not the only one to make the decision . the __penryn__ primary academy cornwall says it is broadcasting the event for children in the school hall , __lasswade__ primary school in __bonnyrigg__ , midlothian are also keeping students indoors and bishop __vesey__ 's grammar school in birmingham is screening it on tv in the afternoon to all but year 7 students , who will be allowed outside . __oldway__ primary school in paignton , devon , is keeping pupils inside . its headteacher , jane smythe -lrb- left -rrb- says she can not guarantee pupils will not look at the sun . some parent 's have back the decision . fiona __bullman__ , in paignton , told the bbc : ` it 's too much of a risk . you ca n't risk 700 children potentially being blinded . unless there 's one adult to one child , you ca n't -lsb- risk it -rsb- . ' the department for education has said what schools do for the eclipse is a matter for individual head teachers to decide . would you let your child watch the solar eclipse ? would you let your child watch the solar eclipse ? now share your opinion . looking at the sun either with naked eyes or through __unfiltered__ binoculars or telescopes can permanently damage people 's eyesight . those who want to look at the occurrence are being advised to use __pin-hole__ projectors or glasses with special filters . it is feared clouds could also ruin viewing of the eclipse , with overcast skies forecast for much of the south west of england . northern cities such as lancaster , york and newcastle should have sunnier days and scotland , where the eclipse will conceal almost 98 per cent of the sun in places , will be largely clear . a met office spokeswoman said : ` forecasting exactly where cloud will break and reform is really not scientifically possible . but it 's not as thick in the south as further north , so you 're more likely to see breaks in the cloud the further south you are . ' it is not unknown for a fleeting break in cloud to occur during an eclipse as the atmosphere cools . another ` deep ' partial eclipse visible in the uk will not occur until august 12 , 2026 , and the next total eclipse not until september __2090__ . tomorrow 's eclipse will produce a __100-mile-wide__ ` totality ' shadow path that crosses the north atlantic and covers only two land masses , the faroe islands between scotland and iceland and the norwegian archipelago of svalbard . astronomer gemma lavender from all about space magazine . do you need special equipment to look at the eclipse ? ` it 's all too easy to look at the sun when an eclipse is happening , but you should never look at the eclipse with naked eyes , binoculars or a telescope without filters - otherwise you run the risk of permanently damaging your eyesight . ` that 's not to say that you ca n't watch the eclipse on friday - but you should ensure that you have the right equipment that will provide you with the right amount of protection . ` dedicated telescopes such as solar telescopes can allow you to observe the eclipse with absolutely no risk . however , unless you already own one , know somebody who does or are looking to get into solar astronomy , they can be a massive investment of several hundred pounds . ` there are cheaper ways to observe the eclipse , though . ' are solar glasses fine to use ? ` many people buy solar glasses or viewers to watch the eclipse . these can be bought quite cheaply from telescope dealers . ` they work by employing a __mylar__ film that blocks out over 99 per cent of the sun 's light , allowing you to view the eclipse safely . ` before using them though , you should make sure that they are not damaged in any way and you should ensure that you have bought them from a reputable dealer . if you 're in doubt , do n't use your viewers at all . ' how can you use a telescope to observe the eclipse ? ` if you own a telescope , then there are several ways for you to observe the eclipse . ` if you do n't own them already , it is possible for you to buy a solar filter , which covers the aperture of your telescope to ensure that you can observe the sun safely . the movement of the sun and moon means the eclipse will be seen at different times around the uk . ` they are found to be made of glass or as with the solar glasses , __mylar__ film . it is possible to make a solar filter using __mylar__ sheets but caution is advised while making your own solar filter - any scratches or __pinholes__ will lead to dangerous amount of sunlight entering your eyes . ` you should also avoid relying on __eyepiece__ filters - they can not handle the sun 's light . ` telescope projection is also a safe way to observe the eclipse . by using two large , white pieces of card , you can project the eclipse 's image onto one piece , while using the other to fit around your telescope 's tube to act as a mask to shield your eyes from the sun . ` focusing your telescope 's __eyepiece__ , while holding the second card away , which projects the image , will enable you to show the eclipse to a large group of people safely . ` you should not use a cheap , plastic telescope for telescope projection and ensure that your __finderscope__ has its cap on . ` never look at the eclipse whilst lining up your telescope with the sun and never leave your telescope unattended . you should also ensure that your instrument does n't overheat . ' can you use household items to view the eclipse ? ` if you do n't have a standard telescope or have forgotten to buy a solar viewer , then there are several household items you can use so that you do n't miss out on seeing this fantastic event . ` using a piece of card , or anything that has small holes punched into it , you can project the eclipse onto another piece of card . this is certainly one of the safest ways of viewing the eclipse since you do n't need to look at the sun at all . ' a washing up bowl or bucket can also be lined with a black bin liner and then filled with water to make a reflective surface to safely watch the eclipse . when and where will the eclipse be visible ? ` the eclipse will begin in the morning . for observers in the uk , the eclipse starts at 8.30 am , peaks at __9.35__ am and ends at __10.41__ am , so you should make sure that you know where the sun rises from your location . ` the total solar eclipse - that 's 100 per cent of the sun 's surface covered by the moon - is visible from the faroe islands and svalbard but if you are unable to get to these locations , many are able to see a substantial partial eclipse - for instance , scotland will see around 90 per cent of the sun 's disc covered by the moon . ' how dark will it get in the uk ? ` in london and even in places where there 's 90 per cent sun coverage , we 're not really going to notice any changes in brightness because there 's still a portion of the sun 's surface uncovered . ` it 'll be like there 's a cloud passing over the sun - you know it 's cloudy but it 's still light . ' this map of the uk shows where the eclipse will be visible and what time it will reach its peak .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     moon will pass in front of sun tomorrow creating 98 % eclipse in some parts . the event due to take place at 9.30 am , meaning children will be at school . parents angry after some headteachers decide to keep youngsters indoors . school chiefs say they will not risk children 's eyesight from looking at sun .

ARTICEL:     when a legendary figure like pat jennings says none of the other __1,097__ matches in his career was comparable with the 1979 fa cup final between arsenal and manchester united , you know it was something special . forever known as wembley 's ` five-minute final ' , arsenal threw away and then regained the trophy in an incredible late sequence that saw them squander a 2-0 lead going into the 86th minute before winning 3-2 in the final moments with a goal that put alan sunderland 's name in fa cup folklore . it created a superstar in arsenal 's man-of-the-match liam brady and broke the career of manchester united manager dave sexton . pat jennings -lrb- left -rrb- and pat rice pose with the fa cup after the dramatic wembley final of 1979 . jennings reacts after conceding a goal as manchester united fought back to level the scores at 2-2 . but alan sunderland scored the winning goal for arsenal to write his name into cup folklore . victorious captain pat rice was so drained and overcome with emotion as he climbed the famous 39 steps to finally lift the trophy , he delivered an unwitting snub to the famous royal guest of honour . rice recalls : ` prince charles was there to present the trophy . he said , ` congratulations ' as we shook hands but as soon as i saw the cup , i turned around to lift it up to the arsenal fans . ' i did n't realise he was still waiting to give me my medal . it was only when i turned back , i saw him with it in his hand . it must have looked insulting but it was n't meant like that . eager is the polite way of putting it . just a couple of minutes before i 'd been out on the pitch thinking ` f *** , we 've blown it ' . ' sammy mcilroy , who had scored united 's dramatic equaliser on a baking hot may afternoon , says the impact of the game has not diminished with time . ` it 's 36 years on and people still ask me about it every week , ' he adds __ruefully__ . ` they always want to know about that final rather than the one we won against liverpool two years earlier . ' united and arsenal meet again in the fa cup on monday in a quarter-final at old trafford but it is impossible that wayne rooney and alexis sanchez will grip the nation like their predecessors did . ` there has not been a final before or since with the twists and turns of that game , ' says brady , who helped set up the winning goal when arsenal were on their knees reeling from mcilroy 's equaliser . ' i played two short of 1,100 games and i have never known four minutes like that , ' adds jennings , a gentle giant of a goalkeeper who otherwise stayed unflappable in a 23-year career with watford , spurs , arsenal and northern ireland . sammy mcilroy -lrb- left -rrb- scored united 's equaliser against arsenal in the dramatic 79 cup final . alexis sanchez -lrb- left -rrb- of arsenal and wayne rooney -lrb- right -rrb- of manchester united will lock horns on monday . the 1979 showpiece took place eight days after margaret thatcher had been elected great britain 's first female prime minister and given the prestige of the fa cup final in those days , the two events seemed equally important at the time . a full house of 100,000 and a tv audience of 15 million was guaranteed . united travelled to their team hotel a full three days before the match to fulfil the insatiable demands of the press , photographers and television cameras , with bbc and itv planning their entire saturday schedules around the final . then , as now , arsenal and united were big clubs in transition . arsenal had not won a trophy for eight years , while united were rebuilding after the glory days of george best , denis law and bobby charlton . they had been relegated to the second division five years earlier . both sets of supporters flocked down wembley way convinced good times were about to return for their club . for 85 minutes , the match appeared routine , with brian talbot scoring for arsenal after 12 minutes and frank stapleton adding to it with a __43rd-minute__ header . the only talking point was over who should be credited with the opening goal -- talbot or sunderland , who appeared to connect at the same time . ' i know it was mine . i 've got a picture on my trophy cabinet showing me kicking the ball and alan kicking my boot , ' says talbot . with arsenal leading 2-0 going into the final minutes , complacency crept in . ` it was unprofessional but i met eyes with liam as if to say , ` yes , we 've won it ' , ' says graham __rix__ . ` we were coasting , comfortable , ' adds talbot . even the experienced jennings says : ' i was imagining myself going up the steps . ' brian talbot -lrb- right -rrb- opened the scoring for arsenal after only 12 minutes in the cup final against united . gordon mcqueen -lrb- fifth left -rrb- pulled a goal back in the 86th minute to give united hope . then , with just five minutes left , arsenal boss terry neill decided to send on substitute steve walford for david price as a thank-you for his performances in earlier rounds . it backfired disastrously . out of nowhere , in the 86th minute , gordon mcqueen drove in a loose ball from a set piece to make it 2-1 . just 106 second later , mcilroy __jinked__ past david o'leary and walford before __toepoking__ past an onrushing jennings to equalise . pandemonium ensued in the stadium as arsenal fell apart . ' i knew the cameras were on me so i put on my best acting , trying to look concerned but not terribly worried , ' says neill . ` in reality , my insides were going up and down . ' reflecting now , mcilroy says : ` the arsenal boys were gone , on their knees . if we 'd taken it into extra-time , we would have won . ' i went crazy , i could have run out of wembley and back in again after that goal . after the game , bob bishop -lsb- the scout from northern ireland who discovered both mcilroy and best -rsb- told me we 'd celebrated too long , we should have gone back to the halfway line and concentrated . ` he was probably right but it was not what we wanted to hear after throwing it away . ' at 2-2 , united were now red-hot favourites but what happened from the restart is part of fa cup legend . brady surged into the united half past mickey thomas , then past lou __macari__ , and slipped a ball to __rix__ on the left . frank stapleton in possession for arsenal in the cup final against united at wembley in 1979 . liam brady -lrb- left -rrb- , frank stapleton -lrb- centre -rrb- and david o'leary -lrb- right -rrb- were in arsenal 's winning squad . __rix__ , a 21-year-old from a south yorkshire pit village , delivered a cross that __arced__ away from united goalkeeper gary bailey , leaving sunderland the chance to score from close-range . the picture of the __bouffant-haired__ forward running away in total ecstasy chased by the __most-relieved__ substitute in history , walford , remains an iconic image . ` when i picked up the ball , i was initially just trying to get the ball away from our goal , ' says brady . ' i went past one challenge , two challenges and i was in the final third and i saw graham outside me . ' __rix__ takes up the story . ' i did n't know sunderland was at the far post , my only thought was to take the cross away from the goalkeeper . it was something i 'd trained on with -lsb- coach -rsb- don howe all those wet and windy wednesday nights : keep it out of the keeper 's grasp . ' sunderland says : ' i went into __auto-pilot__ and when the ball went it , the pent-up emotion came out .

' slipped through the net : __germanwings__ co-pilot andreas __lubitz__ had suffered from depression and ` burnout ' which had held up his career . investigators enter __lubitz__ 's house on the outskirts of dusseldorf yesterday as the probe into the crash continues . in a blunt admission , __carsten__ __spohr__ , the head of lufthansa , which owns the budget airline , admitted __lubitz__ had slipped through the safety net . ` the pilot had passed all his tests , all his medical exams , ' he said . ` he was 100 per cent fit to fly without any restrictions . ` we have at lufthansa , a reporting system where crew can report -- without being punished -- their own problems , or they can report about the problems of others without any kind of punishment . ` all the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case . ' __lubitz__ passed one of the most rigorous assessments when he was accepted for flight training by lufthansa , according to the telegraph . the airline said __lubitz__ trained at the lufthansa flight training school in bremen . an assessment required by germany 's civil aviation authority , the __dlr__ , plus standards imposed by lufthansa were needed before he was accepted . however , although the process includes __psychometric__ testing of the candidate 's ability to work under pressure and handle stress , they do not examine personality or lifestyle more closely , the telegraph reported . lufthansa , like other airlines , does not operate a formal vetting process for aspiring pilots . investigation : french prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation for what appears to be a case of suicide involving mass murder . search : teams working in the difficult alpine terrain clear scattered crash debris and search for bodies and belongings . debris from the jet , operated by lufthansa 's __germanwings__ budget airline , was found near __barcelonnette__ . new information about __lubitz__ 's life emerged just hours after police investigating the disaster began a four-hour search of his flat , which he is said to have shared with a girlfriend . officers found ` evidence of mental illness ' but no suicide note , der spiegel reported . it is understood detectives have found significant material on __lubitz__ 's computer , which they are now carefully examining for any explanation for his terrible actions . he reportedly received a year and half of psychiatric treatment and was at one point recommended to be examined by a doctor before flying . however , he passed his psychological assessments and was later considered fit to fly . germany 's federal aviation office confirmed this morning that __lubitz__ had a medical condition noted in his pilot 's records which required him to have a regular examination . doctors giving pilots their regular medical checks assess their psychological __soundness__ at the same time , according to the uk 's civil aviation authority . this is done before they first fly and at regular intervals after that -- once a year for __under-40s__ and every six months for those over that age . pilots are not made to sit detailed psychological tests , but the doctors are qualified to spot problems including signs of stress , fatigue and drug or alcohol abuse . caa standards state : ` during assessment of the applicant 's history , the doctor should make a general inquiry about mental health , which may include mood , sleep and alcohol use . ` the doctor should observe the applicant during the process of the examination and assess the mental state of the applicant . ' a caa spokesman said : ` there is a psychological element to the pilots ' medical assessments . it forms part of the medical examination which pilots have to undergo to get their medical certificate without which they ca n't fly .

'' for more than 200 days , protests have taken place in ferguson since the august shooting death of unarmed black teenager michael brown . ferguson police officer darren wilson was not indicted . at the time of his arrest , williams was on probation for receiving stolen property . the prosecutor thanked the public for the information that led to the arrest . he said police served a search warrant on williams ' residence where they seized a .40 - caliber handgun , `` which has been tied to the shell casings that were recovered '' at the scene of the shooting . williams is being held on a __cash-only__ $ 300,000 bond , mcculloch said , adding that it 's possible williams could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case . one element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent , mcculloch said , adding that williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he was n't aiming at the police officers . investigators are not sure they `` buy '' williams ' claim that he opened fire after a dispute with other individuals , mcculloch said , but he did n't rule it out . `` it 's possible he was firing at someone else , '' he said , urging any other witnesses with information to come forward . the shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city 's police station shortly after midnight wednesday , at the end of a protest against the ferguson police department , st. louis county police chief jon belmar said at the time . officers saw `` muzzle flashes ... about 125 yards away , '' belmar said . `` we could have buried two police officers , '' belmar told reporters last week . `` i feel very confident that whoever did this ... came there for whatever nefarious reason that it was . '' public donations poured in to be used toward a reward to find the gunman and any accomplices , belmar said . authorities offered a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of person or persons responsible for the gunfire upon the two officers , according to the st. louis regional crimestoppers website . mcculloch said the tipster whose information led to williams ' arrest is eligible to receive the reward . protesters said they had nothing to do with the shooting , and that the shots came from a grassy hill away from the crowd . `` in no way are they representative of the thousands of people ... who have been protesting , '' said antonio french , a st. louis alderman . belmar believes someone targeted the police , who have faced heated criticism for months , he said . `` these police officers were standing there , and they were shot just because they were police officers , '' he said . the department has been criticized since the shooting death of brown and , more recently , since a scathing u.s. department of justice report documented a pattern of racial discrimination in the city . police chief thomas jackson resigned wednesday . `` we are actively addressing the issues that have raised concerns of fairness and fair treatment . we support peaceful protesting . however , we will not allow , nor tolerate , the destructive and violent actions of a few to disrupt our unifying efforts , '' the mayor of ferguson and the city council said in a statement sunday . while many protesters have decried the ferguson police department , neither of the officers shot last week were from the city . one is from webster groves , a st. louis suburb 13 miles south of ferguson . the officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years ' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek , just under his right eye , belmar said . the other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back , belmar said . he is a 41-year-old officer with the st. louis county police department , who has been in law enforcement for 14 years . both men have been treated and released . cnn 's carma hassan , sara sidner , jason carroll , shimon __prokupecz__ , evan perez and alina machado contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     twitter has admitted it needs to get tougher on trolls and has already introduced new ways to report abuse to weed out the perpetrators . but now it 's taking aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the site . its rules now say that users must not ` post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject 's consent ' . twitter 's rules have been updated in an attempt to clamp down on revenge porn . under ` private information ' -lrb- pictured -rrb- the guidelines now say that users must not ` post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject 's consent ' . the site said it will verify complaints and suspended abusive users . the changes were spotted by __buzzfeednews__ , which recently submitted a q&a to reddit when the community site took a similar stance against pornographic posts . twitter has used these questions to address the changes . both twitter 's rules and abusive behaviour policy have been updated to reflect these changes . twitter said that an affected user can report a post if they believe it contains photos or videos posted without their consent . in february a law was passed that made posting revenge porn images and videos a criminal offence in england and wales . both scotland and northern ireland are considering similar laws . under the rules , revenge porn is considered : ` photographs or films which show people engaged in sexual activity or depicted in a sexual way or with their genitals exposed , where what is shown would not usually be seen in public ' . it covers images shared without the subject 's permission and ` with the intent to cause harm . offenders face up to two years in jail . this follows laws in sixteen us states - including alaska , california , new jersey and texas - explicitly relating to revenge porn . under copyright laws the video or photos technically belong to the person who took it and who can , in theory , distribute it as they see fit but twitter 's rules additionally considers the people in the footage . it will ask the person reporting the abuse to verify they are the person in the post and that it was posted without their permission . twitter said ` agents will then act on content posted in violation of the policy ' , including removing the post or suspending the accounts of repeat offenders . ` users who believe that content they post has been incorrectly identified is violating the policy can appeal the decision and agents will review that request as well , ' said the firm . ` content that is identified as violating our policy will be hidden from public view and users posting it will have their accounts locked ; those users will be required to delete the content in question before being able to return to the platform . ` users posting such content with an intent to harass will be subject to suspension from twitter . ' the changes follow reports twitter would start banning users who violate its rules by tracking email addresses and phone numbers . this means that if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details twitter will be able to intervene . reports recently claimed twitter will start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers . when people sign up by email they are also given the option to add a phone number -lrb- pictured -rrb- . in the future , twitter may ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide this number . stories of abuse , threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on twitter in recent years . robin williams ' daughter , zelda williams , left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father 's suicide . feminist critic anita __sarkeesian__ was threatened with rape , sexual violence and death by twitter trolls during the ` __gamergate__ ' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games . in the uk , journalist caroline criado-perez also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce jane austen as the new face of the # 10 note . twitter users isabella __sorley__ and john nimmo admitted sending the messages to ms criado-perez and both were jailed last year . when people sign up to twitter they are required to provide an email address , which is then validated . adding a phone number is an optional step and is predominantly used if people want to receive text notifications or setup two-step verification . under the reported plans , once a user is banned these email addresses and phone numbers will be stored and __cross-referenced__ each time a new user signs up to the site . last month an internal memo sent by twitter 's chief executive dick costolo revealed the 51-year-old thinks his site ` sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls ' . in the memo , mr costolo said he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future . mr costolo 's comments were posted on an internal forum among twitter employees , after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse . in december , a blog post titled ` building a safer twitter ' revealed twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse . the site has since improved the reporting process to make it more __mobile-friendly__ , and it now requires less initial information . in december , a blog post titled ` building a safer twitter ' revealed twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse . the site has since improved the reporting process to make it more __mobile-friendly__ , and it now requires less initial information . it has also made it simpler to flag tweets and accounts for review . these enhancements similarly improved the reporting process for people who see abuse but are n't directly receiving it . more recently the site posted a follow-up blog updating users on its new safety features . mailonline has contacted twitter for more information about how users details will be stored . under the malicious communications act 1988 , any ` indecent or grossly offensive ' message that causes ` distress or anxiety ' to the recipient can lead to prosecution . the maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than # 2,500 . since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet , e-mail and social networking , prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge twitter trolls . student liam stacey , who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer fabrice muamba collapsed , was charged under the crime and disorder act . two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the serious crime act , and paul chambers , who joked he would blow doncaster airport ` sky high ' was charged under the communications act 2003 . it has also made it simpler to flag tweets and accounts for review . these enhancements similarly improved the reporting process for people who see abuse but are n't directly receiving it . more recently , the site posted a follow-up blog updating users on its new safety features . tina __bhatnagar__ , twitter 's vice president of user services said : ` over the last six months , in addition to the product changes , we have overhauled how we review user reports about abuse . ` overall , we now review five times as many user reports as we did previously , and we have tripled the size of the support team focused on handling abuse reports . ` we are also beginning to add several new enforcement actions for use against accounts that violate our rules . these new actions will not be visible to the vast majority of __rule-abiding__ twitter users - but they give us new options for acting against the accounts that do n't follow the rules and serve to discourage behavior that goes against our policies . the safety of our users is extremely important to us . it 's something we continue to work hard to improve . ' in recent years twitter has come under fire for failing to protect its users from trolls . robin williams ' daughter , zelda williams , left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father 's death . she made an appeal to her followers to report two users on twitter -lrb- shown above -rrb- .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     twitter updated its rules and behaviour policy to tackle revenge porn . users can no longer ` post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject 's consent ' it said it will carry out checks to verify the people making the complaints . and if a post is found to breach its rules , the user could be suspended . twitter boss dick costolo recently said site ` sucks ' at dealing with trolls . in an internal memo he also took responsibility for twitter 's problems . twitter streamlined its abuse reporting system in december .

' foot upon foot of unrelenting snow did little to brighten the spirits of boston 's residents - but it did have one silver lining . in the wake of blizzard season , a costumed joker who dubbed himself the boston yeti started cropping up around the blanketed city . and now the figure , whose __@bostonyeti2015__ twitter account has amassed 8,500 followers , has received his just reward . king of winter : the so-called boston yeti , who was pictured around the city amidst relentless snowstorms , was jokingly made mayor on st patrick 's day . in the midst of the city 's st patrick 's day parade on sunday , mayor marty walsh invited the masked figure to pose in front of a city of boston backdrop and declared him ` interim mayor ' . however , walsh did feel compelled to step in moments after the prank and clarify ' i love boston and am here to stay ' . only kidding : boston 's actual mayor marty walsh , left , soon stepped in to clarify that he was n't being replaced by a mythical figure . snow : a woman walks past high snow banks and deep puddles as she walks through the chinatown neighborhood of boston .

' the judge ordered aims plumbing & building services limited to pay the couple almost # 290,000 for the destruction of their edwardian home . mr __goldswain__ and ms hale were forced to move out of their dream property , along with their neighbour , and subsequent checks by finchley council revealed the house would have to be pulled down . broken home : workers dismantle the property in north london after the botched basement extension . a judge today ruled that it was the builders ' ` incompetence ' which led to the collapse . in tatters : the builders were ordered to pay # 290,000 in compensation to mr __goldswain__ and ms hale , but the couple were told they may not see a penny because the firm has gone bust . all gone : the couple were forced to live a nomadic existence after the house was taken down -lrb- pictured -rrb- , moving through a string of temporary homes , but have now settled in __harpenden__ . there is now nothing more than a hole where their old house used to be , with supporting beams used to keep the neighbouring properties up . edward __goldswain__ and his partner jacqueline hale , who was eight months pregnant at the time , had to run from their flat as the house collapsed . but the court heard aims is ` believed to be __insolvent__ ' , so the couple may well never see any of the money . describing it as ' a sad case ' , the judge said the couple bought a lease of the ground floor of 4 stanhope avenue in 2011 . they needed more space for their growing family and decided to extend into the basement , aims starting work in september 2012 . however , it all went horribly wrong on november 24 2012 after a heavy rain storm , said the judge . cracks which the couple had already noticed began to widen fast and ` they could actually hear the fabric of the house tearing apart ' . the couple and the upstairs tenant , who had a baby , hastily evacuated and watched as the building crumbled . ` deeply shocked ' , mr __goldswain__ and miss hale escaped with little more than the clothes they stood up in , the court heard . they watched as the flank wall first ballooned outwards before collapsing in on itself . the next door house was also badly damaged . heavily pregnant miss hale went into premature labour due to the trauma , although her baby was happily delivered unharmed . the council took emergency steps to __shore-up__ what remained of the building and it has remained derelict ever since . since the destruction of their home , the couple have led a nomadic existence , moving between temporary homes , but have now settled in __harpenden__ . and they suffered yet another blow when they discovered that the loss was not covered by their home insurance . they now face paying off the remaining 23 years of the mortgage , while dealing with the heart-breaking loss of their house , according to the evening standard . the couple 's lawyers argued that aims was ` completely out of its depth ' and ` not competent to do the job which it had been employed to do ' . and the judge ruled : ` the overwhelming probability is that aims failed to carry out their work with reasonable care and skill ' . ` the firm had taken no effective steps to to prop up the flank wall or to lay a concrete floor slab which could have averted disaster . ' however , the judge said aims had ` played no part ' in the case and was believed to be __insolvent__ . the couple also sued engineering firm , __beltec__ limited , who designed the essential structure of the basement extension . however , whilst expressing ` the greatest sympathy ' for the couple , the judge ruled that the company had not been negligent and bore no responsibility for the disaster . aims was ordered to pay # __287,754__ damages - although the couple are likely to face an uphill struggle in getting hold of any of that . denying claims they opted for the cheapest service on offer , miss hale said she considered quotes from a number of builders before selecting aims . she and mr __goldswain__ checked references and chose a firm that said it had carried out basement extensions in the past . she added : ` the builder did have insurance , which i made him get , and checked before he started . i also called the company to make sure he had it . but they also declined to cover him . ' some neighbouring houses were damaged by the collapse , including one that the wall fell against . some of those neighbours ' sued the couple . ` they will be paid , ' miss hale said . ` everyone but us gets paid , basically .

ARTICEL:     twitter has admitted it needs to get tougher on trolls and has already introduced new ways to report abuse to weed out the perpetrators . but now it 's taking aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the site . its rules now say that users must not ` post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject 's consent ' . twitter 's rules have been updated in an attempt to clamp down on revenge porn . under ` private information ' -lrb- pictured -rrb- the guidelines now say that users must not ` post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject 's consent ' . the site said it will verify complaints and suspended abusive users . the changes were spotted by __buzzfeednews__ , which recently submitted a q&a to reddit when the community site took a similar stance against pornographic posts . twitter has used these questions to address the changes . both twitter 's rules and abusive behaviour policy have been updated to reflect these changes . twitter said that an affected user can report a post if they believe it contains photos or videos posted without their consent . in february a law was passed that made posting revenge porn images and videos a criminal offence in england and wales . both scotland and northern ireland are considering similar laws . under the rules , revenge porn is considered : ` photographs or films which show people engaged in sexual activity or depicted in a sexual way or with their genitals exposed , where what is shown would not usually be seen in public ' . it covers images shared without the subject 's permission and ` with the intent to cause harm . offenders face up to two years in jail . this follows laws in sixteen us states - including alaska , california , new jersey and texas - explicitly relating to revenge porn . under copyright laws the video or photos technically belong to the person who took it and who can , in theory , distribute it as they see fit but twitter 's rules additionally considers the people in the footage . it will ask the person reporting the abuse to verify they are the person in the post and that it was posted without their permission . twitter said ` agents will then act on content posted in violation of the policy ' , including removing the post or suspending the accounts of repeat offenders . ` users who believe that content they post has been incorrectly identified is violating the policy can appeal the decision and agents will review that request as well , ' said the firm . ` content that is identified as violating our policy will be hidden from public view and users posting it will have their accounts locked ; those users will be required to delete the content in question before being able to return to the platform . ` users posting such content with an intent to harass will be subject to suspension from twitter . ' the changes follow reports twitter would start banning users who violate its rules by tracking email addresses and phone numbers . this means that if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details twitter will be able to intervene . reports recently claimed twitter will start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers . when people sign up by email they are also given the option to add a phone number -lrb- pictured -rrb- . in the future , twitter may ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide this number . stories of abuse , threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on twitter in recent years . robin williams ' daughter , zelda williams , left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father 's suicide . feminist critic anita __sarkeesian__ was threatened with rape , sexual violence and death by twitter trolls during the ` __gamergate__ ' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games . in the uk , journalist caroline criado-perez also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce jane austen as the new face of the # 10 note . twitter users isabella __sorley__ and john nimmo admitted sending the messages to ms criado-perez and both were jailed last year . when people sign up to twitter they are required to provide an email address , which is then validated . adding a phone number is an optional step and is predominantly used if people want to receive text notifications or setup two-step verification . under the reported plans , once a user is banned these email addresses and phone numbers will be stored and __cross-referenced__ each time a new user signs up to the site . last month an internal memo sent by twitter 's chief executive dick costolo revealed the 51-year-old thinks his site ` sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls ' . in the memo , mr costolo said he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future . mr costolo 's comments were posted on an internal forum among twitter employees , after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse . in december , a blog post titled ` building a safer twitter ' revealed twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse . the site has since improved the reporting process to make it more __mobile-friendly__ , and it now requires less initial information . in december , a blog post titled ` building a safer twitter ' revealed twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse . the site has since improved the reporting process to make it more __mobile-friendly__ , and it now requires less initial information . it has also made it simpler to flag tweets and accounts for review . these enhancements similarly improved the reporting process for people who see abuse but are n't directly receiving it . more recently the site posted a follow-up blog updating users on its new safety features . mailonline has contacted twitter for more information about how users details will be stored . under the malicious communications act 1988 , any ` indecent or grossly offensive ' message that causes ` distress or anxiety ' to the recipient can lead to prosecution . the maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than # 2,500 . since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet , e-mail and social networking , prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge twitter trolls . student liam stacey , who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer fabrice muamba collapsed , was charged under the crime and disorder act . two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the serious crime act , and paul chambers , who joked he would blow doncaster airport ` sky high ' was charged under the communications act 2003 . it has also made it simpler to flag tweets and accounts for review . these enhancements similarly improved the reporting process for people who see abuse but are n't directly receiving it . more recently , the site posted a follow-up blog updating users on its new safety features . tina __bhatnagar__ , twitter 's vice president of user services said : ` over the last six months , in addition to the product changes , we have overhauled how we review user reports about abuse . ` overall , we now review five times as many user reports as we did previously , and we have tripled the size of the support team focused on handling abuse reports . ` we are also beginning to add several new enforcement actions for use against accounts that violate our rules . these new actions will not be visible to the vast majority of __rule-abiding__ twitter users - but they give us new options for acting against the accounts that do n't follow the rules and serve to discourage behavior that goes against our policies . the safety of our users is extremely important to us . it 's something we continue to work hard to improve . ' in recent years twitter has come under fire for failing to protect its users from trolls . robin williams ' daughter , zelda williams , left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father 's death . she made an appeal to her followers to report two users on twitter -lrb- shown above -rrb- .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     twitter updated its rules and behaviour policy to tackle revenge porn . users can no longer ` post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject 's consent ' it said it will carry out checks to verify the people making the complaints . and if a post is found to breach its rules , the user could be suspended . twitter boss dick costolo recently said site ` sucks ' at dealing with trolls . in an internal memo he also took responsibility for twitter 's problems . twitter streamlined its abuse reporting system in december .

ARTICEL:     poorer families are more likely to eat chicken nuggets and chips for dinner , while wealthier households consume more salad and rice , new research has revealed . the latest figures from roy morgan show that socioeconomic status and family income have a significant impact on foods consumed . at the top end of the scale , children eat more salad and rice , but as income decreases more chips , wedges , chicken nuggets and noodles are consumed . new research shows children from lower income families are more frequently consuming chips than they are salads . in the wealthiest households , 62 per cent of kids aged __6-13__ will eat rice every week , while 55 per cent will also have salad at some stage . less than half will eat hot chips , fries , or wedges , while just over a third will consume noodles . around a quarter of these children will eat chicken nuggets during an average week . however at the other end of the spectrum childrens ' eating habits change quite dramatically . with each successive drop in socioeconomic status , children in the household are less likely to eat rice or salad , and more likely to eat noodles or chicken nuggets . kids from wealthier families will see more salad on the table , with 55 per cent consuming the greens in an average week . at the lower end of the scale 60 per cent of children will consume chips , wedges or fries , but only 44 per cent will eat a salad during an average week . noodles are on the menu for 55 per cent of these kids , chicken nuggets are eaten by 40 per cent , and just half of these children will see rice on their table . ` while the food that parents buy and give to their children is heavily influenced by the affordability of groceries , there may be many other issues at play such as the number of children -lrb- and parents -rrb- in the household , working hours , accessibility of fresh produce in the local area , as well as underlying attitudes and tastes , ' michele levine , ceo , roy morgan research said . the presence of rice at __mealtimes__ has increased , and 62 per cent of kids at the higher end of the spectrum have it each week . ` for example , price alone does not fully explain the __inverse__ changes in popularity for rice and noodles among children across socio-economic __quintiles__ . ' the research also revealed that more parents are trying to make a conscious choice about purchasing __additive-free__ food , which is up to 50 per cent from 45 last year . however figures in this section also show that as socioeconomic status declines , so does the amount of parents making the decision to buy __additive-free__ foods . noodles and hot chips are eaten more frequently than salads in lower socioeconomic households . despite this , increasing numbers of parents are paying closer attention to what they put on the table for their children . ` more than five million australians are parents with children under 16 in the home . our research into health attitudes shows that over the last five years an increasing proportion of parents are mindful of their own calorie , fat , dairy , and red meat intake , but are slightly less likely to be trying to limit how much sugar their kids eat , ' michele levine said . ` our single source survey can connect parents ' demographics and household status with their health attitudes , grocery shopping behaviours , exercise habits and food consumption rates to deliver a 360-degree view of the changing lifestyles of australian families .

' jonny evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the newcastle united striker , who then __retaliates__ . evans and papiss cisse clash near the half-way line at st james ' park following the unpleasant exchange . manchester united defender evans has received a __six-match__ ban from the fa after the ugly incident . cisse already served a three-match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing everton 's seamus coleman in december . as a result , the newcastle striker gets an additional one-match suspension after admitting his guilt , while evans gets six . the incident , during united 's 1-0 win at st james ' park on wednesday , was not seen by referee anthony taylor or his assistants , but was caught on tv . a three-man panel of former referees reviewed the footage on thursday and agreed the players should have been sent off , prompting the fa to bring a charge . an independent regulatory commission heard the charge and decided both players should be banned . cisse , 29 , pleaded guilty and issued an apology for his part in the incident . he is suspended for an extra game as he was banned in december for elbowing everton 's seamus coleman . by contrast , evans , 27 , had denied the charge on thursday , saying : ` i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at papiss cisse .

' mourinho believed a __wrongly-awarded__ penalty denied his side an eight-point lead over manchester city at the top of the league . the portuguese coach was fined # 25,000 for saying there was a ` clear campaign ' against his side after cesc fabregas was denied a penalty and booked for diving instead in the december 28 draw at st mary 's . mourinho says that arsenal are a danger to chelsea , although he is happy with his current strong position . on sunday mourinho was frustrated nemanja matic was penalised - allowing dusan tadic to score from the spot and cancel out diego costa 's first premier league goal for almost two months - while branislav ivanovic was not awarded a spot kick at the other end . ` i 'm happy with the situation . i 'm happy with the six-point lead , but i 'm not happy with the result , ' mourinho said . ` if you remember our two matches against southampton : in one game , one penalty that is not a penalty and in another game a penalty that was not given . you are speaking about six points transformed into two points . ' mike dean -lrb- right -rrb- gave southampton the penalty for their equaliser , mourinho said that it ` is not a penalty ' thibaut courtois could not keep out dusan tadic 's spot-kick and the playmaker secured a point for saints . mourinho was clearly upset with the penalty decisions , but bit his tongue on this occasion . he said : ` my opinion is not important . important is mr mike dean -lrb- the referee -rrb- . ` his decision was a penalty and his decision was no penalty on ivanovic . ' ivanovic may have been clipped by tadic , but fell __theatrically__ , __dissuading__ dean from pointing to the spot . nemanja matic brought down saido mane for southampton 's equaliser but mourinho was clearly upset . branislav ivanovic went down in search of a penalty but dean did not give the desired spot-kick . asked about the fall , mourinho deferred to his media officer sitting alongside , saying : ` you have to control me , if not ... ' mourinho was told television pundit graeme souness - with whom he had a public exchange of views this week after the scot criticised chelsea 's conduct in the champions league exit to paris st germain - thought matic had conceded a penalty . ` graeme souness says also that it 's more a reason to criticise a player who asks for a yellow card than a player who kicks somebody in the chest , ' mourinho added . ' i went to sky and they told me their pundits said it 's a penalty . i went to bbc and they told me it 's not a penalty . i went to the radios and they told me it 's not a penalty . mourinho was told television pundit graeme souness thought matic had conceded a penalty , and responded . mourinho said that pundits ` win every game ' due to their position of being critical but exempt from criticism . ` pundits are paid to wear my suit , but i 'm not paid to wear their suit or to comment on their comments . ` if one day i become a pundit , i will wear a manager 's suit . i will win every game , because pundits win every game , and then i can be critical and i can be phenomenal like they are . ' matic was replaced by ramires soon after a second-half foul on sadio mane which could have seen him booked for a second time - after his initial yellow when giving away the penalty - and sent off for a second successive premier league game . ` when that penalty is given you have to believe that the second yellow card can come , ' said mourinho . matic was substituted for ramires in the second half but could have seen a second yellow card for one foul . video arsenal still not in title race - wenger .

' i feel ridiculous and i have n't wanted to leave the house since . i thought i was saving money but it 's cost me a fortune in make-up trying to cover it up . ` my lips looked great after - but only for about three minutes until the bruising started and then my lips went down anyway .

' so keen to keep up with her peers , gail planned to have the procedure , too . she explains : ` it was n't that i was unhappy with my lips , i 've never had an issue with them , but i liked the way enhanced lips look , especially around the __cupids__ bow . ' but at # 200 a time she was struggling to save the cash . she said : ` i wanted it done earlier this year but i 've been saving for a holiday and then my laptop broke so when heard about a cheaper way i decided to try it . ' gail is warning other women who may have heard about diy lip jobs to steer well clear after her botched attempt that left her in serious pain . however , her thrifty attempt has left her worse off than she was before and she 's turned to make-up to try and cover the bruising and says she wo n't be able to model again until it 's healed completely . ' i thought i 'd saved money but it 's probably cost me that in foundation trying to cover it , ' she added . gail posted a warning on her own facebook page at the weekend and says she has since been thanked by other women who were planning to perform diy lip jobs . she said : ` i have been lucky . i 've since heard of other women who have actually burst blood vessels doing this . it 's just not worth it .

ARTICEL:     have i said too much ? by carole white . -lrb- century # 20 -rrb- . does carole white 's name sound vaguely familiar ? it is probably because you saw her in the model agency , channel 4 's 2011 __fly-on-the-wall__ documentary series about premier , which she founded in 1981 . her colleagues ' affectionate nickname for her was ` the witch ' . fag in hand , with a voice like a __corncrake__ , a vocabulary that would make a __navvy__ blush and a skin tanned to the texture of a prada handbag , she made ab fab 's patsy and __edina__ look like maiden aunts . and her new autobiography confirms that the real world of high fashion is more outrageous than any tv drama . supermodel , linda evangelista -lrb- pictured -rrb- , was one of the internationally renowned models on premier 's books in the eighties . as a teenager in the swinging sixties , carol had a brief career as a lucie clayton model , but gave it up because she felt self-conscious in front of the camera . at 19 , she took up with an unsuitable boyfriend -lrb- she admits to a weakness for handsome bad boys -rrb- and became pregnant with her daughter simone . having met a more suitable chap , she married him and landed her dream job as a booker at her former model agency , lucie clayton . the marriage did n't last , but the job did . leaving her daughter in kent with her parents -lrb- ` i did n't get to see much of my poor little simone at that time ' -rrb- , carole flung herself into a bohemian world of models , rock stars and endless wild parties . just before christmas 1981 , __bobtons__ , the king 's road agency where she had been working , went bust , leaving ` about 20 __worry-faced__ models currently without representation ' . ten days later , with # 10,000 loaned by her brothers , carole signed up the __bobtons__ girls and premier was born . a week after that , eileen ford , the tough __doyennne__ of the new york modelling world , swept into the office to take a look at the new upstart agency , and suggested they do business . ` it was like meeting maggie thatcher ' , carole recalls . ` her hair was __honey-blonde__ and stiff and she was very straight-talking ... we were officially on our way . ' the eighties saw the rise of the supermodel , and , with linda evangelista and naomi campbell on its books , premier was ` really rocking ' . in 1990 , after evangelista , christy turlington , campbell , cindy crawford and __tatjana__ __patitz__ appeared together on the cover of british vogue , premier brokered the deal for the models to appear in george michael 's ` freedom ' video , in which they __lip-synched__ the lyrics . it was n't all glamour , though . ` those top girls could be difficult ' , carole recalls . ` they liked to test people to see if they could magic up whatever crazy request they might have that __day/hour/second__ ... i saw it as a challenge . ' the list of ` challenges ' posed by her supermodels ranged from the truly bizarre , including __peremptory__ demands for sex toys , llama curry and an urgent supply of ` special green candles from tibet that were something to do with a witch doctor that had special energy ' , to the mundane : persuading them to get out of bed , or trying to ensure they were no more than three hours late for their auditions . the more you read , the more nightmarish the task of dealing with these __highly-strung__ freaks of beauty sounds . but even after so many years , carole still seems captivated by the excitement of finding the next new face . ` when they 're really special ... they 're like thoroughbred horses , ' she writes . ` they sort of __quiver__ . ' she claims not to believe in regret : ` but i 'd say turning down kate moss was probably the closest i came to one . ' the future supermodel came to the premier offices ` and i stupidly said : `` no , she 's too short for me , '' and off she trotted ... i know , shoot me now ! ' she is unrepentant about the hedonistic excesses of the nineties when , as she puts it , ` the industry was full of __nutters__ ' , remarking __cheerily__ that ` it 's a very good job __camera-phones__ were n't around ' . and her views on the size zero debate are __trenchant__ : . ` why does modelling have such a bad rep ? i think ... it 's probably because there are so many overweight people in this country . it 's like we want to __mollycoddle__ anyone who is n't thin . ' have i said too much ? is n't an easy read -- and not just because of carole 's abrasive views and __attention-deficit__ prose style , which reads as though she had dictated her book in 30-second bursts between phone calls . still , in a world of elaborate __artifice__ , there is something rather refreshing about someone who simply does n't care that her nickname is ` the witch ' . you might not like her by the end of this book , but you ca n't help admiring her -- just a bit .

' mourinho believed a __wrongly-awarded__ penalty denied his side an eight-point lead over manchester city at the top of the league . the portuguese coach was fined # 25,000 for saying there was a ` clear campaign ' against his side after cesc fabregas was denied a penalty and booked for diving instead in the december 28 draw at st mary 's . mourinho says that arsenal are a danger to chelsea , although he is happy with his current strong position . on sunday mourinho was frustrated nemanja matic was penalised - allowing dusan tadic to score from the spot and cancel out diego costa 's first premier league goal for almost two months - while branislav ivanovic was not awarded a spot kick at the other end . ` i 'm happy with the situation . i 'm happy with the six-point lead , but i 'm not happy with the result , ' mourinho said . ` if you remember our two matches against southampton : in one game , one penalty that is not a penalty and in another game a penalty that was not given . you are speaking about six points transformed into two points . ' mike dean -lrb- right -rrb- gave southampton the penalty for their equaliser , mourinho said that it ` is not a penalty ' thibaut courtois could not keep out dusan tadic 's spot-kick and the playmaker secured a point for saints . mourinho was clearly upset with the penalty decisions , but bit his tongue on this occasion . he said : ` my opinion is not important . important is mr mike dean -lrb- the referee -rrb- . ` his decision was a penalty and his decision was no penalty on ivanovic . ' ivanovic may have been clipped by tadic , but fell __theatrically__ , __dissuading__ dean from pointing to the spot . nemanja matic brought down saido mane for southampton 's equaliser but mourinho was clearly upset . branislav ivanovic went down in search of a penalty but dean did not give the desired spot-kick . asked about the fall , mourinho deferred to his media officer sitting alongside , saying : ` you have to control me , if not ... ' mourinho was told television pundit graeme souness - with whom he had a public exchange of views this week after the scot criticised chelsea 's conduct in the champions league exit to paris st germain - thought matic had conceded a penalty . ` graeme souness says also that it 's more a reason to criticise a player who asks for a yellow card than a player who kicks somebody in the chest , ' mourinho added . ' i went to sky and they told me their pundits said it 's a penalty . i went to bbc and they told me it 's not a penalty . i went to the radios and they told me it 's not a penalty . mourinho was told television pundit graeme souness thought matic had conceded a penalty , and responded . mourinho said that pundits ` win every game ' due to their position of being critical but exempt from criticism . ` pundits are paid to wear my suit , but i 'm not paid to wear their suit or to comment on their comments . ` if one day i become a pundit , i will wear a manager 's suit . i will win every game , because pundits win every game , and then i can be critical and i can be phenomenal like they are . ' matic was replaced by ramires soon after a second-half foul on sadio mane which could have seen him booked for a second time - after his initial yellow when giving away the penalty - and sent off for a second successive premier league game . ` when that penalty is given you have to believe that the second yellow card can come , ' said mourinho . matic was substituted for ramires in the second half but could have seen a second yellow card for one foul . video arsenal still not in title race - wenger .

ARTICEL:     have i said too much ? by carole white . -lrb- century # 20 -rrb- . does carole white 's name sound vaguely familiar ? it is probably because you saw her in the model agency , channel 4 's 2011 __fly-on-the-wall__ documentary series about premier , which she founded in 1981 . her colleagues ' affectionate nickname for her was ` the witch ' . fag in hand , with a voice like a __corncrake__ , a vocabulary that would make a __navvy__ blush and a skin tanned to the texture of a prada handbag , she made ab fab 's patsy and __edina__ look like maiden aunts . and her new autobiography confirms that the real world of high fashion is more outrageous than any tv drama . supermodel , linda evangelista -lrb- pictured -rrb- , was one of the internationally renowned models on premier 's books in the eighties . as a teenager in the swinging sixties , carol had a brief career as a lucie clayton model , but gave it up because she felt self-conscious in front of the camera . at 19 , she took up with an unsuitable boyfriend -lrb- she admits to a weakness for handsome bad boys -rrb- and became pregnant with her daughter simone . having met a more suitable chap , she married him and landed her dream job as a booker at her former model agency , lucie clayton . the marriage did n't last , but the job did . leaving her daughter in kent with her parents -lrb- ` i did n't get to see much of my poor little simone at that time ' -rrb- , carole flung herself into a bohemian world of models , rock stars and endless wild parties . just before christmas 1981 , __bobtons__ , the king 's road agency where she had been working , went bust , leaving ` about 20 __worry-faced__ models currently without representation ' . ten days later , with # 10,000 loaned by her brothers , carole signed up the __bobtons__ girls and premier was born . a week after that , eileen ford , the tough __doyennne__ of the new york modelling world , swept into the office to take a look at the new upstart agency , and suggested they do business . ` it was like meeting maggie thatcher ' , carole recalls . ` her hair was __honey-blonde__ and stiff and she was very straight-talking ... we were officially on our way . ' the eighties saw the rise of the supermodel , and , with linda evangelista and naomi campbell on its books , premier was ` really rocking ' . in 1990 , after evangelista , christy turlington , campbell , cindy crawford and __tatjana__ __patitz__ appeared together on the cover of british vogue , premier brokered the deal for the models to appear in george michael 's ` freedom ' video , in which they __lip-synched__ the lyrics . it was n't all glamour , though . ` those top girls could be difficult ' , carole recalls . ` they liked to test people to see if they could magic up whatever crazy request they might have that __day/hour/second__ ... i saw it as a challenge . ' the list of ` challenges ' posed by her supermodels ranged from the truly bizarre , including __peremptory__ demands for sex toys , llama curry and an urgent supply of ` special green candles from tibet that were something to do with a witch doctor that had special energy ' , to the mundane : persuading them to get out of bed , or trying to ensure they were no more than three hours late for their auditions . the more you read , the more nightmarish the task of dealing with these __highly-strung__ freaks of beauty sounds . but even after so many years , carole still seems captivated by the excitement of finding the next new face . ` when they 're really special ... they 're like thoroughbred horses , ' she writes . ` they sort of __quiver__ . ' she claims not to believe in regret : ` but i 'd say turning down kate moss was probably the closest i came to one . ' the future supermodel came to the premier offices ` and i stupidly said : `` no , she 's too short for me , '' and off she trotted ... i know , shoot me now ! ' she is unrepentant about the hedonistic excesses of the nineties when , as she puts it , ` the industry was full of __nutters__ ' , remarking __cheerily__ that ` it 's a very good job __camera-phones__ were n't around ' . and her views on the size zero debate are __trenchant__ : . ` why does modelling have such a bad rep ? i think ... it 's probably because there are so many overweight people in this country . it 's like we want to __mollycoddle__ anyone who is n't thin . ' have i said too much ? is n't an easy read -- and not just because of carole 's abrasive views and __attention-deficit__ prose style , which reads as though she had dictated her book in 30-second bursts between phone calls . still , in a world of elaborate __artifice__ , there is something rather refreshing about someone who simply does n't care that her nickname is ` the witch ' . you might not like her by the end of this book , but you ca n't help admiring her -- just a bit .

ARTICEL:     a great-grandfather left with a gaping hole in his face due to cancer treatment has been given the devastating news his condition is terminal . raymond martin , 64 , has facial __angiosarcoma__ , a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels . he has already undergone a series of operations , the first of which took surgeons 12 hours to remove a tumour from his face . but the cancer returned and he required more treatment , as well as procedures to remodel his nose and face . a few months ago he developed a huge wound under his right eye , and doctors planned surgery to remove another tumour . raymond martin , 64 , has been told the cancer that has destroyed his face is incurable and there is nothing more doctors can do . he is pictured before being diagnosed -lrb- left -rrb- and afterwards -lrb- right -rrb- . mr martin developed a spot on his face in 2012 , which began to spread . he was diagnosed with facial __angiosarcoma__ , a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels in 2013 . the cancer returned and mr martin developed a gaping hole under his right eye . he is pictured with his family -lrb- from left to right -rrb- , grandson dean martin , 17 , wife alice , 63 and daughter julie martin . but surgeons discovered the cancer had spread to such an extent that there is nothing more that can be done . all they can do is help change his bandages and keep him as comfortable as possible . now , mr martin and his family are speaking out to raise awareness of __angiosarcoma__ , in the hope his story can help others . mr martin 's daughter nicola borthwick , 42 , said : ` they 've told us nothing more can be done now . ` we only hope that marty 's story raises awareness and prevents anyone else undergoing what he has had to suffer . ' mr martin is now housebound at his home in __scotswood__ , newcastle , where he is cared for by wife alice , 63 . his problems began when he noticed a spot on his cheek in 2012 , but thought nothing about it . ` it all started with just a spot and it was nothing special so i did n't worry about it , ' mr martin said . ` but the spot started to spread so i went to see a gp and it was first thought that it could be a rash or infection and i was given a course of antibiotics . ' however , the antibiotics did not work and because his face got worse , he was sent to hospital for tests . __angiosarcoma__ is a relatively rare soft tissue tumour . it usually occurs in the head , neck , and especially in the scalp of elderly people . its presentation varies from a small plaque to __multifocal__ __nodules__ . the treatment depends on the extent of the disease , but most cases are treated with wide __excision__ - a surgical procedure to remove a small area of diseased or problematic tissue with a margin of normal tissue - and reconstruction . radiotherapy and chemotherapy are advocated in recurrent or extensive abnormalities in tissue . source : national centre for biotechnology information . ` never in a hundred years , could i have imagined that i would be told i had cancer , ' mr martin said . medics at newcastle 's royal victoria infirmary took a skin biopsy from mr martin and experts identified that he had a rare form of cancer that was affecting a large part of his face . there was no other option than to perform a __12-hour-long__ life-saving surgery to remove the tumour . this involved taking skin from mr martin 's thigh , grafted onto his face . the operation completely changed his appearance . ' i knew that the operation had to be done , so i just had to get on with it , ' he said . ` when i was going home from hospital i thought ' i do n't want to look in the mirror ' . it was a few weeks before i had a proper look at myself and i did get frightened as it looked like i had a bandage on my face . ' following the operation , doctors were optimistic that they had removed the whole tumour and mr martin underwent an intensive course of chemotherapy in the hope of killing any remaining cancer cells . but , just six months later , the facial __angiosarcoma__ returned and once again he required further treatment at the region 's northern centre for cancer care . in 2014 mr martin underwent a 12-hour operation where surgeons removed a cancerous tumour and took skin from his thigh to graft on to his face . mr martin is now cared for at his home by his wife alice , 63 . he hopes that through telling his story he will raise awareness to this rare form of cancer . after a series of operations to remodel his face and nose , mr martin believed his life was back on track and he could accept his new appearance . but in recent months a wide and painful hole began to develop under his right eye , as the cancer had once again returned . after initially preparing for surgery to remove another tumour , mr martin was dealt the devastating blow that the cancer had spread too rapidly for treatment to be successful . the wound has grown and deteriorated rapidly over recent weeks mr martin 's eyes bleed constantly , and he has to have his bandages changed regularly . his family have rallied around him to support him , and he now hopes , through telling his story , that others will become more aware of __angiosarcoma__ and its devastating effects .

ARTICEL:     the man who invented the coffee pods used by millions of americans in their __keurig__ instant brewing machines has admitted he regrets ever coming up with the design . in an interview with the atlantic , john __sylvan__ , who came up with the idea for the coffee pods and the machine in the early 1990s , revealed that he ` feels bad ' about the negative impact that the pods are having on the environment . __sylvan__ , who no longer uses the plastic pods himself , also confessed he wishes he had never created them in the first place . ' i feel bad sometimes that i ever did it , ' said mr __sylvan__ , who sold his share of the company in 1997 for $ 50,000 . scroll down for video . regrets : john __sylvan__ -lrb- pictured -rrb- says that he often wishes he had never invented the __keurig__ coffee pods . __keurig__ is currently thought to be one of the most popular at-home brewing systems in america . last year the company sold 9.8 billion __keurig-brewed__ portion packs and earned $ 4.7 billion . the design is simple - a small plastic capsule containing ground beans that can be put into a machine to produce a cup of coffee at the touch of a button . however despite the multi-billion pound success of the company nothing has been done to try and make the packaging of the popular __keurig__ pods recyclable . and mr __sylvan__ insists this will never happen . ` no matter what they say about recycling , those things will never be recyclable , ' he said . ` the plastic is a specialized plastic made of four different layers . ' mr __sylvan__ , who co-founded the company with peter __dragone__ , added that the unique plastic used in the __k-cups__ - known as plastic # 7 - is only recyclable in a small number of cities in canada , and can not as yet be processed yet in the united states . unfortunately the plastic is also integral to the unique design of the pods . it ensures that the coffee inside stays completely protected from any outside elements and remains completely intact while the coffee is being brewed . the popularity of the simplistic coffee pods has also come across the shores to the uk . adverts for __k-cup__ featuring the slogan ` brew the love ' , enticed american audiences . and in england thousands of customers have been lured into buying __nespresso__ machines following similar adverts featuring george clooney . __nespresso__ is now the most prominent capsule company in the uk . the machines do not take the __keurig__ capsules but take similar plastic ones and __nespresso__ has established its own sustainability advisory board . mr __sylvan__ also confessed that despite his earlier dedication to the brand , he no longer drinks coffee made using the capsules . in 1995 he had to go to hospital with heart palpitations after testing up to 40 cups of his coffee a day . he now no longer even owns a __k-cup__ machine and only drinks filter coffee . george clooney has helped __popularise__ the __nespresso__ brand in the uk , a similar version of the __k-cups__ . damaging : __keurig__ has come under fire on numerous occasions from environmentalists who claim that the number of __k-cups__ sold in 2014 alone would circle the earth 12 times if they were laid down end-to-end . __keurig__ has come under fire on numerous occasions from environmentalists who claim that the number of __k-cups__ sold in 2014 alone , and subsequently put into landfills , would circle the earth a staggering 12 times if they were laid down end-to-end . they have started a kill the __k-cup__ campaign , which features a youtube video showing the world being destroyed by the plastic coffee capsules . but despite the continued criticism , __keurig__ green mountain , the brewing system 's parent company , has yet to come up with a viable solution to the problem , despite insisting that they have been trying to find an environmentally-friendly alternative since 2006 . ` it 's a warranted criticism , ' monique __oxender__ , chief sustainability officer for __keurig__ green mountain , told the salt earlier this year . ` we 're not proud of where we are right now , and we 're committed to fixing it . ' alternative option : mr __sylvan__ insists that he has managed to create a new design for the __k-cups__ which would be far more environmentally-friendly than the ones currently being used . not according to mr __sylvan__ . the entrepreneur insists that he has come up with an alternative design to his original creation which would involve relying on the same kinds of materials used for foil ketchup packets . but while mr __sylvan__ is convinced that he holds the answer to __keurig__ 's ongoing environmental concerns , he added that the company have thus far refused to trial his new design . ' i told them how to improve it , but they do n't want to listen , ' he added to the atlantic . ` there 's a much better way of doing it . ' ironically , mr __sylvan__ 's current work , running energy efficient solar energy company __zonbak__ , requires him to be much more mindful of the environment , which is perhaps why he is suffering from such feelings of guilt over his most infamous creation .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     john __sylvan__ created the __keurig__ instant coffee system in the early 1990s . one in three homes in america is thought to have coffee brewing system . mr __sylvan__ said __keurig__ 's own-brand __k-cup__ pods can not be recycled . he admitted he no longer drinks __keurig__ coffee or owns a __k-cup__ machine . __sylvan__ drinks filter coffee after __keurig__ testing caused heart palpitations . americans were charmed by ` brew the love ' adverts to buy a __k-cup__ . similar adverts in uk for __nespresso__ were fronted by george clooney . this has boosted popularity of __nespresso__ capsule coffee in the uk .

' but the harper issue does bring back memories of a __depressingly__ frank admission from billy stark , then scotland under-21 boss , in june 2009 . a month earlier , xavi and iniesta had passed manchester united to death during the 2009 champions league final at rome 's stadio olimpico . recalling a community coaching forum at hampden 24 hours before , stark said : ' i was asked whether iniesta and xavi would have flourished and come through the scottish system . ` it 's hard to say because you 're looking at two different cultures but the answer is - probably not . the spanish place an emphasis on sheer technique and movement . our game is based more on power and pace . so there 's an argument that they would n't have come through in this country to become the players they are now . scotland under __19s__ manager ricky __sbragia__ claimed harper is not big enough physically . harper is currently midway through a five-year deal with real madrid and is tipped to have a big future . ` but the spanish approach is working for them and it deserves to be copied , ' he added . former scotland manager craig brown has urged caution in the rush to condemn the under-fire __sbragia__ . ` i 've the greatest of admiration for ricky as a man and a coach , ' said the 74-year-old . ` my friend archie knox speaks highly of him and he 's also worked under sir alex ferguson at manchester united . so i 'd like to hear more on the context of the words spoken by him -lrb- about jack harper -rrb- . ` but i would say this : people are saying this young lad is a real madrid player . he 's not ; he 's never played for real madrid . i was a rangers signing but i never played for rangers . ` real madrid will have hundreds of kids in their system . i 'm not for a minute saying jack harper is not a good player . i have n't seen him so i do n't know . former scotland boss craig brown -lrb- second right -rrb- revealed his admiration for under 19 coach __sbragia__ . ` but i think people get hypnotised by the name real madrid . there 's a frenzy going on but if -lrb- the same player -rrb- played for another club would there be the same impact ? ' brown admitted it is an occupational hazard of a national youth selector to end up looking foolish . ` you ca n't get every player right , ' he said . ` here 's my example : when i was scotland under 21 manager , i got a phone call from the late alex wright , manager of dumbarton , saying he had a good player for me . it was owen coyle , and he was good , but i did n't think he was as good as kevin gallacher and gordon __durie__ . ' i told alex the only reason i would be picking owen would be solely to prevent ireland getting him -- and that would be unfair . he would have been a bench player for scotland . ` so the irish picked him instead and our next game was against ireland at easter road . my __over-age__ centre half that day was alex mcleish and owen knocked the ball past alex and stuck it in the roof of his net . ' i remember thinking ` i 've messed up here ' . but we ended up winning 4-1 and i think __durie__ scored three . but you can get egg on your face ... '

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- the gift of an inquiring mind can be both exhilarating and torturous . my job is to ask tough questions , but when it comes to faith , god , and religion , the more questions i ask in my quest for truth and understanding , the more complex the answers become . i was a bit of a rebellious child . my mom might tell you differently , but i never saw that as a bad trait . i felt that if i questioned authority , fought for the underdog , battled for the things that people told me were impossible , i would be different . change the world maybe . that same rebellious spirit also led to things that definitely were not good for me , like hanging with the wrong crowd and getting into the type of trouble that i would rather not put in print . that 's when i `` found god . '' i became a `` born-again '' christian when i attended a young life camp in high school . my home life was n't exactly going __swimmingly__ , and this group really embraced me . i loved the christian notion of community , giving back , praying for others and making friends that cared more about doing good than getting drunk , smoking pot and having sex . i opened my arms to jesus and fully embraced christian morals and principles . i decided that i was going to be `` that good girl '' and go on to do great things . i started off at __westmont__ , a beautiful christian college nestled in the heart of santa barbara , california . what a safe place that was . it was also extremely nurturing . the professors dedicated bountiful amounts of time to our individual spiritual development , and regularly prayed with us . my peer group was all about what ministry you signed up for , not what sorority you were rushing . we lifted each other up , had intimate sunrise bible studies on the beach and spent hours hanging out with friends , talking about how to lead a __godly__ life . as glorious and fulfilling as all that appeared , two years into college , the world became much larger to me . more complex , diverse , intellectually and spiritually challenging . it became the world of church , religion and faith versus the world of ideas , cultures , and philosophies . i found myself more drawn to carl jung than the book of corinthians . a good friend gave me a book , the myth of certainty . it posed these questions : . `` do you ever feel somewhat schizophrenic about the relationship of your faith to the rest of your life ? do you find yourself __compartmentalizing__ different aspects so that tensions between them are minimized ? '' the answer to all of these for me was : yes . i started to read a lot . i wanted to mesh with a myriad of thinkers , and religious scholars . i needed to make a change . i left __westmont__ after my sophomore year and transferred to usc 's school of journalism . i discovered i had too many questions about faith to pursue a life of ministry , but i felt good about this transition . to me , it made perfect sense , because like ministers , true journalists love people , listen well and want to make a difference within this universe . meet the friendly atheists next door . the key difference is , in journalism , if we gather the `` facts , '' we can usually find the answers to what we 're looking for . when it comes to god , jesus and the holy spirit , those answers rest in faith . as a journalist , i seek intellectual certainty . when it came to my faith , i felt intellectually embarrassed . there was so much i just could n't explain . when i started working on a documentary about the growth of atheism , i found myself in a profound place of reflection . in the days when i thought i was going to pursue a life of ministry , i experienced and felt many things that were __unexplainable__ . what was that ? god ? a higher power ? energy ? or just good karma for trying to lead such a generous and selfless life ? there is no way to know . my stepfather , who grew up in -- but later left -- the mormon church has a perspective on religion that i find intriguing . he does n't believe in a god with a long white beard and flowing robes who sits upon a cloud guiding our daily lives . that concept is too abstract . but while he may not embrace `` __god-liness__ , '' he does believe in `` __good-liness__ . '' god , he told me in one of our many colorful spiritual discussions , is the `` good '' in humankind . he and i definitely agree that the concept of god should not be dismissed as having no meaning . to the contrary , it has a very important meaning , for it refers in symbolic language to the highest dimension of human existence , our spirituality . after years of spiritual reflection and inquiry , i am at a place where i do n't want to feel guilty , hypocritical , judgmental , __closed-minded__ or arrogant . so , where do i stand now -- 30 years after `` finding god , '' questioning my faith , committing sins , seeking hazardous adventure and trying to love life and people to the best of my ability ? i am a `` seeker . '' a constant seeker within this world , among people and , of course , for spiritual enlightenment of all kind . because if i did possess the truth -- the `` final answer '' -- i am convinced i would spend the rest of my years missing out on the enrichment and surprise of seeking it . i guess i just love my exhilarating and torturous life .

ARTICEL:     more than a dozen homes were raided on tuesday in a crackdown on so-called ` maternity tourism ' operators who arrange for pregnant chinese women to give birth in the u.s. , where their babies automatically become american citizens . the crackdown on three alleged maternity tourism rings may be the biggest yet by federal homeland security agents who say that , while pregnant women may travel to the u.s. , they can not lie about the purpose of their trip when applying for a visa . birth tourism has been reported from a range of countries , but authorities say the most recent cases in california have catered to wealthy chinese amid a boom in tourism from mainland china . it is unclear how many women travel to the united states for maternity tourism . scroll down for video . federal agents serve warrants and question several residents at the pheasant ridge apartment complex in rowland heights , california , while investigating alleged ` birth tourism ' centers on tuesday . a woman appears shocked as she takes to a federal agent on tuesday in what was described as one of the biggest ever raids on ` maternity tourism ' in the u.s. . a federal agent looks through a disposable diaper box while executing search warrants during the ongoing investigation into alleged birth tourism centers . shortly after sunrise on tuesday , federal agents swarmed an upscale apartment complex in the orange county city of irvine where authorities say a birth tourism business charged pregnant women $ 50,000 for lodging , food and transportation . according to the la times , during the raid pregnant women were seen opening doors to apartments , looking confused and then slamming them shut . one agent announced ` baby here ' and then called over a colleague to go inside . crying babies could be heard from several apartments , according to the la times . investigators said women were coached to lie about their travel plans when applying for tourist visas and were promised they would receive social security numbers and u.s. passports for their babies before returning to china . in one instance , a trainer in china helped fabricate employment and income information for an undercover federal agent posing as a pregnant client to secure a tourist visa and encouraged her to fly through hawaii , where customs officers were believed to be more lenient than in los angeles , according to a copy of an affidavit in support of a search warrant . the business netted its owners hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past two years and helped chinese tourists deliver more than 400 american babies at orange county hospitals , the court papers said . no arrests were made or charges filed . investigators conducted the searches in orange , los angeles and san bernardino counties , hoping to collect evidence of crimes tied to three separate maternity tourism operations , including visa and tax fraud , u.s. immigration and customs enforcement said . ice agents from the u.s. department of homeland security look into the window of a luxury apartment in rowland heights , orange county . federal agents enter an upscale apartment complex on tuesday in irvine , california . shortly after sunrise , federal agents swarmed the complex in orange county where authorities say a birth tourism business charged pregnant women $ 50,000 for lodging , food and transportation . a website that advertises the services of a u.s. company catering to women from china who want to give birth in the u.s. federal agents undertook a massive raid at a complex in irvine , california on tuesday . the key draw for travelers is that the united states offers birthright citizenship . maternity tourists believe citizenship will help their children secure a top-notch u.s. college education and provide a sort of insurance policy should economic conditions crumble in their home country -- especially since the tourists themselves can apply for a green card once their american child turns 21 . bill __ong__ __hing__ , professor of the university of san francisco school of law , said wealthy foreigners from across the world often travel to the united states for medical care and are allowed to do so on visitor visas , provided they do n't __overstay__ . u.s. customs and border protection warns on its website that officers at airports and on the border will consider a pregnant woman 's due date , travel plans and medical insurance to determine whether she can enter the country . in the irvine case , investigators said another undercover officer posing as a pregnant traveler was told not to apply for her visa too late as she would be denied if she were noticeably pregnant . a pregnant woman who was questioned at the airport said she was told to say she was simply a tourist , court papers said . investigators also tracked the movements of a couple who arrived in february 2014 , had their baby in april and returned in may . while the couple 's bank account recorded charges at luxury stores including louis vuitton and rolex , they paid $ __4,080__ -- less than 15 per cent of the billed amount -- to the hospital for medical services after stating the mother was not employed , the affidavit said . federal agents started investigating the business after an anonymous tip last year . in 2013 , los angeles county cited more than a dozen maternity hotels for code violations after an uproar in a nearby suburban community about a hotel operating in a residential neighborhood . jon __feere__ , legal policy analyst for the center for immigration studies , said he believes birth tourism will grow along with international travel . ` there is a sense the foreigner has control over our immigration policy rather than the american people , ' said __feere__ , who wants stricter limits on immigration . the business netted its owners hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past two years and helped chinese tourists deliver more than 400 american babies at orange county hospitals , according to court papers .

ARTICEL:     the world is finally in the grip of a long-awaited el niño event that could alter global weather patterns - but the phenomenon is far weaker than expected . scientists have announced that sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central pacific ocean and have started to alter wind patterns . the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance el niño will continue through the summer . the us national oceanic and __atmosopheric__ administration has detected warmer than average water surface temperatures around the equator of the pacific ocean -lrb- shown above -rrb- which indicates the arrival of el niño . however , they say that the el niño conditions are currently ` extremely weak ' and come at a time of the year when the influence of el niño on weather patterns usually declines . this means that while el niño conditions normally brings wetter weather to the northern hemisphere in the summer , it is unlikely to be bring substantially more rainfall than this spring . el niño is caused by a shift in the distribution of warm water in the pacific ocean around the equator . usually the wind blows strongly from east to west , due to the rotation of the earth , causing water to pile up in the western part of the pacific . this pulls up colder water from the deep ocean in the eastern pacific . however , in an el niño , the winds pushing the water get weaker and cause the warmer water to shift back towards the east . this causes the eastern pacific to get warmer . but as the ocean temperature is linked to the wind currents , this causes the winds to grow weaker still and so the ocean grows warmer , meaning the el niño grows . this change in air and ocean currents around the equator can have a major impact on the weather patterns around the globe by creating pressure anomalies in the atmosphere . the noaa said that it was unlikely the phenomenon would bring enough rain this spring to break the three-year record-breaking drought that is currently affecting california . some meteorologists , however , have warned that this el niño could combine with another slow movement of water temperature in the pacific ocean called the pacific __decadal__ __osciallation__ -lrb- __pdo__ -rrb- . the __pdo__ reached record levels in december last year and january this year , and should it stay strong , it may combine with el niño to increase global temperatures . mike __halpert__ , deputy director of noaa 's climate prediction centre , said : ` based on the persistent observations of above-average sea surface temperatures across the western and central equatorial pacific ocean and consistent pattern of sea level pressure , we can now say that el niño is here . ` many climate prediction models show this weak el niño continuing into summer . ' the arrival of this el niño is considered to be late after scientists last year predicted they were expecting one last year , but the conditions failed to materialise . according to the met office el niño conditions generally bring warmer temperatures to europe during the autumn and colder winter temperatures . the above diagram shows the sea surface temperature -lrb- __sst__ -rrb- in the pacific ocean on 25 __feburary__ 2015 and it can be seen that around the equator the temperature was above average -lrb- marked by red -rrb- on that date . it can also make __sourthern__ europe wetter during the late summer and autumn . perhaps the greatest impact is felt in the monsoon regions of south east asia where the climate is usually drier than normal in el niño years . el niño is one of the most powerful climate altering __phenonoma__ on the planet . it is the result of the el niño southern __oscillation__ , which is the cycle of warm and cold water across the pacific ocean . this cycle occurs at intervals of between two to seven years and can last for nine months to two years . when the ocean is warmer than average for seven to nine months , the noaa officially classes it as el niño conditions . california is in the midst of the worst drought in 1,200 years and has caused severe drying of the stevens creek reservoir -lrb- shown above -rrb- . it is unlikely the el niño will bring enough spring rain to ease the drought . the last el niño , in 2009-2010 , was a moderate to strong event . this brought freezing weather to northern europe in the winter of __2009/2010__ and the uk was exceptionally cold . the vancouver winter olympics also suffered a far warmer than average winter during the same event . other recent el niño 's in __2002-2003__ , __2004-2005__ and __2006-2007__ have been weak to moderate in strength . the last very strong el nino was __1997-1998__ and was known for providing heavy rainfall in the west of the united states , especially california . the noaa said that last week the sea temperature across much of the equatorial pacific ocean has been above average . they also found that unusually weak easterly winds have persisted across the eastern pacific ocean . in late january and february there were a couple of westerly wind bursts of over the central tropical pacific and forecasts for march suggest these will continue . the noaa said that this mean the equatorial southern __oscillation__ index , which is uses to monitor the el niño , has been a negative value for the second month in a row . the above diagram shows the impacts of a typical el niño on seasonal temperatures around the world . the above diagram shows how a typical el niño is expected to change seasonal rainfall around the world . in a blog post on the onset of el niño , the noaa said : ` at this time , these are extremely weak el niño conditions , during a time of year when the influence of el niño on weather patterns in north america or other locations outside of the tropics is weakening . ` from an impacts perspective , this is not particularly momentous , as el niño impacts are weak in the spring and summer . ` still , after months of hovering under the threshold , we can now say that el niño conditions have arrived . ' noaa scientists are to continue monitoring the situation and will issue an update in april . however , eric __holthaus__ , a meteorologist writing for new scientist , warned that the arrival of el niño could result in this year being especially warm . he said : ` el niño transfers huge amounts of heat from the oceans to the atmosphere , and there are hints that this el niño , combined with the already very warm global oceans , could bring about a new phase in global warming . ` an associated slow-moving indicator of pacific ocean temperatures , called the pacific __decadal__ __oscillation__ -lrb- __pdo__ -rrb- , reached record levels in december and january . ' a persistently strong __pdo__ is associated with cold winters in the eastern us and drought in california -- we 've had both in abundance this year . ` should the __pdo__ stay strong , it will essentially join forces with el niño and increase the odds that 2015 will rank as the warmest year on record globally . '
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     us national oceanic and atmospheric administration declares warmer than average water in pacific ocean signal the arrival of el niño conditions . they predict there is a 50 % __-60__ % chance el niño will continue this summer . however this year 's el niño is currently far weaker than in previous events . some meteorologists warn el niño could combine with another 10 year ocean warming cycle to produce record global temperatures this year . experts had expected el niño to start last year but it did not materialise .

ARTICEL:     the world is finally in the grip of a long-awaited el niño event that could alter global weather patterns - but the phenomenon is far weaker than expected . scientists have announced that sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central pacific ocean and have started to alter wind patterns . the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance el niño will continue through the summer . the us national oceanic and __atmosopheric__ administration has detected warmer than average water surface temperatures around the equator of the pacific ocean -lrb- shown above -rrb- which indicates the arrival of el niño . however , they say that the el niño conditions are currently ` extremely weak ' and come at a time of the year when the influence of el niño on weather patterns usually declines . this means that while el niño conditions normally brings wetter weather to the northern hemisphere in the summer , it is unlikely to be bring substantially more rainfall than this spring . el niño is caused by a shift in the distribution of warm water in the pacific ocean around the equator . usually the wind blows strongly from east to west , due to the rotation of the earth , causing water to pile up in the western part of the pacific . this pulls up colder water from the deep ocean in the eastern pacific . however , in an el niño , the winds pushing the water get weaker and cause the warmer water to shift back towards the east . this causes the eastern pacific to get warmer . but as the ocean temperature is linked to the wind currents , this causes the winds to grow weaker still and so the ocean grows warmer , meaning the el niño grows . this change in air and ocean currents around the equator can have a major impact on the weather patterns around the globe by creating pressure anomalies in the atmosphere . the noaa said that it was unlikely the phenomenon would bring enough rain this spring to break the three-year record-breaking drought that is currently affecting california . some meteorologists , however , have warned that this el niño could combine with another slow movement of water temperature in the pacific ocean called the pacific __decadal__ __osciallation__ -lrb- __pdo__ -rrb- . the __pdo__ reached record levels in december last year and january this year , and should it stay strong , it may combine with el niño to increase global temperatures . mike __halpert__ , deputy director of noaa 's climate prediction centre , said : ` based on the persistent observations of above-average sea surface temperatures across the western and central equatorial pacific ocean and consistent pattern of sea level pressure , we can now say that el niño is here . ` many climate prediction models show this weak el niño continuing into summer . ' the arrival of this el niño is considered to be late after scientists last year predicted they were expecting one last year , but the conditions failed to materialise . according to the met office el niño conditions generally bring warmer temperatures to europe during the autumn and colder winter temperatures . the above diagram shows the sea surface temperature -lrb- __sst__ -rrb- in the pacific ocean on 25 __feburary__ 2015 and it can be seen that around the equator the temperature was above average -lrb- marked by red -rrb- on that date . it can also make __sourthern__ europe wetter during the late summer and autumn . perhaps the greatest impact is felt in the monsoon regions of south east asia where the climate is usually drier than normal in el niño years . el niño is one of the most powerful climate altering __phenonoma__ on the planet . it is the result of the el niño southern __oscillation__ , which is the cycle of warm and cold water across the pacific ocean . this cycle occurs at intervals of between two to seven years and can last for nine months to two years . when the ocean is warmer than average for seven to nine months , the noaa officially classes it as el niño conditions . california is in the midst of the worst drought in 1,200 years and has caused severe drying of the stevens creek reservoir -lrb- shown above -rrb- . it is unlikely the el niño will bring enough spring rain to ease the drought . the last el niño , in 2009-2010 , was a moderate to strong event . this brought freezing weather to northern europe in the winter of __2009/2010__ and the uk was exceptionally cold . the vancouver winter olympics also suffered a far warmer than average winter during the same event . other recent el niño 's in __2002-2003__ , __2004-2005__ and __2006-2007__ have been weak to moderate in strength . the last very strong el nino was __1997-1998__ and was known for providing heavy rainfall in the west of the united states , especially california . the noaa said that last week the sea temperature across much of the equatorial pacific ocean has been above average . they also found that unusually weak easterly winds have persisted across the eastern pacific ocean . in late january and february there were a couple of westerly wind bursts of over the central tropical pacific and forecasts for march suggest these will continue . the noaa said that this mean the equatorial southern __oscillation__ index , which is uses to monitor the el niño , has been a negative value for the second month in a row . the above diagram shows the impacts of a typical el niño on seasonal temperatures around the world . the above diagram shows how a typical el niño is expected to change seasonal rainfall around the world . in a blog post on the onset of el niño , the noaa said : ` at this time , these are extremely weak el niño conditions , during a time of year when the influence of el niño on weather patterns in north america or other locations outside of the tropics is weakening . ` from an impacts perspective , this is not particularly momentous , as el niño impacts are weak in the spring and summer . ` still , after months of hovering under the threshold , we can now say that el niño conditions have arrived . ' noaa scientists are to continue monitoring the situation and will issue an update in april . however , eric __holthaus__ , a meteorologist writing for new scientist , warned that the arrival of el niño could result in this year being especially warm . he said : ` el niño transfers huge amounts of heat from the oceans to the atmosphere , and there are hints that this el niño , combined with the already very warm global oceans , could bring about a new phase in global warming . ` an associated slow-moving indicator of pacific ocean temperatures , called the pacific __decadal__ __oscillation__ -lrb- __pdo__ -rrb- , reached record levels in december and january . ' a persistently strong __pdo__ is associated with cold winters in the eastern us and drought in california -- we 've had both in abundance this year . ` should the __pdo__ stay strong , it will essentially join forces with el niño and increase the odds that 2015 will rank as the warmest year on record globally . '
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     us national oceanic and atmospheric administration declares warmer than average water in pacific ocean signal the arrival of el niño conditions . they predict there is a 50 % __-60__ % chance el niño will continue this summer . however this year 's el niño is currently far weaker than in previous events . some meteorologists warn el niño could combine with another 10 year ocean warming cycle to produce record global temperatures this year . experts had expected el niño to start last year but it did not materialise .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- denmark has slammed as `` unacceptable '' comments by russia 's envoy to denmark that joining nato 's missile defense shield would make danish warships `` targets for russian nuclear missiles . '' in august last year , denmark said that at least one of its frigates would be equipped with a radar that would allow it to contribute to nato 's missile defense shield . in an opinion article published in the danish newspaper __jyllands__ __posten__ on saturday , russian ambassador mikhail __vanin__ said he did not think the danes fully understood the consequences of joining the missile shield . `` if this happens , danish warships become targets for russian nuclear missiles , '' he wrote . denmark 's minister for foreign affairs martin __lidegaard__ said __vanin__ 's remarks were unacceptable . `` russia knows full well that nato 's missile defense is defensive and not targeted at them -lrb- russia -rrb- , '' __lidegaard__ said . `` however , i would not __over-dramatize__ this . right now we disagree with russia on many important issues , but we also cooperate , for example , in the arctic and it is important that the tone between us does not escalate . we certainly are not contributing to that . '' tensions between russia and nato member countries have been mounting since russia 's annexation of crimea in 2014 and claims its military has been involved in the ongoing violence in eastern ukraine . moscow has repeatedly denied its military is involved . in april 2014 , nato foreign ministers said they had `` decided to suspend all practical civilian and military cooperation between nato and russia '' over the issue . the united states and nato allies have been conducting military exercises as part of `` operation atlantic resolve , '' which the united states describes as `` a demonstration of our continued commitment to the collective security of nato and dedication to the enduring peace and stability in the region , in light of the russian intervention in ukraine specifically . '' on march 2 , nato deputy secretary general alexander __vershbow__ told the alliance 's annual meeting on arms control : `` russia 's illegal annexation of crimea and its continuing __destabilization__ of eastern ukraine have put the european security system -- and all the rules and agreements that underpin it -- under severe strain . '' last monday , state-run russian media reported that russian president vladimir putin had ordered his northern fleet `` to full alert in a snap combat readiness exercise '' in the arctic . at least one russian leader described the drill as routine and unrelated to the `` international situation . '' conversely , deputy foreign minister alexey __meshkov__ told __tass__ news agency that russia was `` deeply concerned '' about nato drills near its border . nato says the long-term goal of its missile shield is `` to merge individual allies ' missile defense assets into a coherent defense system , providing full protection for nato european populations , territory and forces against ballistic missiles threats .

' the announcement came as another of russia 's leading opposition figures vowed that he and his supporters will not be intimidated by as he walked free from a __15-day__ spell in jail . alexei navalny , who had been convicted of handing out leaflets calling for an opposition rally , said he would continue his staunch criticism of vladimir putin 's government despite the mr nemtsov 's murder seven days ago . emerging unshaven from a moscow detention centre this morning , mr navalny said : ` this act of terror has n't achieved its goal , it will not frighten me or my comrades . we will not reduce our efforts , we will not step back . ' a key figure in boris yeltsin 's 1990s government , mr nemtsov was the most prominent figure in russia 's liberal opposition to be killed during president vladimir putin 's 15-year rule . the 55-year-old was shot four times in the back by a gunman in a passing car as he walked hand-in-hand with miss __duritskaya__ on a bridge across the __moskva__ river on friday night , in the shadow of central moscow 's st basil cathedral . the ukrainian woman - physically unhurt in the attack - revealed the death threats to police in kiev , who said today they were providing her with protection . ` on march 5 , anna __duritskaya__ , who is a witness in the case in the murder of russian opposition politician boris nemtsov , turned to the ukrainian police in the kiev region with a statement on a threat to her life from unidentified individuals , ' said the __prosecutor-general__ 's office in ukraine . the statement offered no information on who might have issued the threats , according to the associated press . the model was staying with her parents since returning to her home country . a relative in ukraine said she was ` in a bad mental state ' . in the aftermath of mr nemtsov 's assassination , miss __duritskaya__ was repeatedly questioned by russian investigators , and she complained that she was held under armed guard and unable to leave the country . however , she returned to ukraine last week . ` this act of terror will not frighten me or my comrades ' : opposition leader alexei navalny said he would continue his staunch criticism of vladimir putin 's government despite the mr nemtsov 's murder . gunned down : boris nemtsov , 55 , -lrb- left -rrb- and 23-year-old miss __duritskaya__ -lrb- right -rrb- were walking hand-in-hand through moscow after having dinner on friday night when he was shot four times in the back . as thousands gathered in moscow to pay their last respects at mr nemtsov 's funeral , putin insisted the russian law enforcement authorities would do ` everything ' to solve the crime . however , nemtsov 's eldest child , __zhanna__ __nemtsova__ , 30 , revealed that investigators had not spoken to a single member of his close family six days after the murder . they believe his ` cruel and __barefaced__ murder ' was because of his political opposition to the kremlin . yesterday a top nato official suggested putin was responsible for mr nemtsov 's death as he accused the russian president of silencing dissent at home while seeking to turn ukraine into a failed state . ` we 've seen that the victims are not just in eastern ukraine , with the brutal murder of boris nemtsov last friday , ' nato deputy secretary general alexander __vershbow__ said . speaking to members of parliament from eu countries at a conference in riga , mr __vershbow__ went on : ` while we do n't know who pulled the trigger , we do know that boris nemtsov was a powerful voice for democracy and against russia 's involvement in ukraine ... -lrb- and -rrb- was among those vilified as `` traitors '' and `` fifth columnists '' in russia 's official propaganda .

' putin has claimed mr nemtsov 's murder - yards from the kremlin - was a ` provocation ' .

' lately , it 's become a symbol for me too , of three islands . there 's the island i 've called home for the past 11 years , the island i write about in my novels , and somewhere in between , perhaps , a deeper truth about this beautiful rock in the middle of the irish sea . independent spirit : the harbour at ramsey , the isle of man 's second biggest town . legend : a carving of the sea god __manannan__ . can a place with a reputation for being safe and sleepy really also be home to spies , killers and evil spirits that feature in my books ? i like to think so , and here are a few reasons why . the weather might be mixed but the landscape is dramatic , whether seen from the sea , walking the coast path , or taking the electric railway to the top of the island 's solitary mountain , __snaefell__ -lrb- from where , on a clear day , you can see the distant __humped__ __blurs__ of scotland , england , ireland and wales -rrb- . the rich variety of locations is something i 've grown to appreciate in my books , and something the isle of man film industry has thrived on during the past decade . need a spooky cottage ? the island has plenty . the same goes for lush __glens__ and lonely __coves__ . but the island provides more than great backdrops . it 's compact , with a population in the region of 85,000 , and while that makes it ideally manageable for a weekend visit , it also fosters something all writers rely on - rumours and hearsay . my first isle of __man-set__ thriller , safe house , grew out of a rumour i heard almost as soon as i moved here - namely , that it 's used as a place to relocate people enrolled in uk witness protection schemes . is the rumour true ? i do n't know for certain , but it seems credible to me . the island is isolated and has lots of __out-of-the-way__ spots . the isle of man also its own very distinct identity . where else could the population swell for a fortnight every june in celebration of a controversial motorbike festival that pits man against machine over a course run on almost 38 miles of public roads ? the isle of man is isolated , with some out of the way spots , lush __glens__ and lonely __coves__ . racing glory : every summer the island hosts the world-famous tt races , with motorbikes reaching 200mph . the tt -lrb- tourist trophy -rrb- races have been in existence since 1907 , with recent competitors recording top speeds of 200mph . but while most islanders are proud of the long tradition of racing greats who have tamed the course , the event is not without its critics . like many others , i find it hard to reconcile the number of fatalities that have occurred with the racing glory , but i ca n't fail to admire how brave the riders must be . another local oddity is __hop-tunaa__ - the isle of man 's version of halloween . taking place every october 31 , it shares many similarities with halloween , but is still marked by some unique __manx__ twists . for example , __hop-tu-naa__ traditionalists carve lanterns from __turnips__ instead of pumpkins , and children call from door-to-door singing nonsense songs instead of trick-or-treating . in fact , one of the songs was striking enough to become the basis for my new thriller , dark tides . it 's a short step from rumours and hearsay to myths and legends , and the isle of man has some of the most interesting i 've ever heard : from the sea god , __manannan__ , who cloaks the isle in a veil of mist to protect it from outside threats , to the __moddey__ __dhoo__ , a big black hound that haunts peel castle . do n't believe me ? why not come to visit and experience it all for yourself ? isle of man steam packet co __steam-packet__ . com __01624__ __661661__ offers crossings from liverpool and __heynsham__ to douglas . one-way fares start at # 62 for a car and two passengers . for further information go to __visitisleofman.com__ dark tides by chris ewan is out now .

ARTICEL:     a woman whose eczema covered her entire body and caused a ` snowstorm ' when she walked says porridge oats have dramatically improved her skin . __amy-louise__ james , 25 , had such severe eczema she had to change her bed sheets every day because of her weeping wounds . she also scratched so much that flakes of skin fell from her body - forcing her to apologise to strangers for being ` disgusting ' . now she has treated her eczema using quaker 's oats -- bought from tesco for # 1.99 . __amy-louise__ james , 25 , had such severe eczema she had to change her bed sheets every day because of her weeping wounds . she also scratched so much that flakes of skin fell from her body - forcing her to apologise to strangers for being ` disgusting ' now , miss james , with her partner nicola , says one of the best remedies she has tried is quaker oats -- bought from tesco for # 1.99 . miss james said spreading porridge over her body has improved her skin - and she is healthier than she has been in years . she said : ` people do n't realise how serious eczema is , they think it 's just red skin that 's a bit itchy . ' i had to change my bed every day because there would be so much skin and my eczema wept so much the sheets got all sticky . ' i __itched__ constantly and there would be blood on the sheets too . it was just permanently painful . ' miss james , who works for a recovery firm in northampton , first suffered from a small flare up aged three . she said : ' i ca n't remember not having eczema . it started in the creases of my arms when i was little . ' the eczema gradually spread over her arms and patches appeared on the back of her knees , followed by her hands , stomach and over her legs . in her teens , the eczema progressed and by aged 15 , it had spread to her neck and her face . she said : ' i was teased for having ` __lovebites__ ' on my neck but it was the eczema . ' i used scarves to try and cover it up but then people thought i was covering the __lovebites__ . ' and while most distraught teenagers would reach for the foundation , miss james had no idea how to use cosmetics . she said : ' i was n't one of those girls who knew how to use make up . i did n't know how to cover it up . ` when i got to college and started going out , i just saw so many girls on nights out who were beautiful and i looked disgusting . ' i just could n't even hide it , so on a bad day i would n't even leave my room . ' i thought it was down to stress with exams . ' miss james ' eczema used to cover her entire body and caused a ` snowstorm ' when she walked . even sat at her desk , miss james was faced with problems . she said : ` at the office i would have to go to the bathroom and have a scratch for 20 minutes . ` my fashion sense went downhill because i could n't wear anything that was n't cotton . ' despite trying countless treatments , nothing worked . skin diseases such as eczema are the most common reason we go to the gp , according to figures from the british skin foundation . the condition , characterised by dry , itchy red skin , is now estimated to affect up to 20 per cent of school children and up to 10 per cent of adults . eczema is an inflammatory condition of the skin characterised by dryness and itching . the skin barrier is unable to function properly , which leads to water loss from the skin , triggering itching . bacteria readily gain entry to the skin - especially if it has been scratched - and cause infection . __moisturisers__ or __emollients__ are the first line in treatment and contain __humectants__ . these contain ingredients that draw water from the lower levels of skin to __rehydrate__ the upper levels and those which prevent further water loss from the surface while the barrier repairs . the inflammation is treated by topical steroids . oatmeal baths have long been recommended for people with sensitive skin conditions including eczema . oats have properties which meant they are able to naturally __moisturise__ the skin and relieve itching . they also contain antioxidants which have an anti-inflammatory effect . ` i 'd used light treatment , different creams , medication , herbal remedies - i 'd tried everything , ' she said . and in desperation to keep her condition at bay , she became reliant on steroid cream , which if used incorrectly , can thin skin and increase the risk of skin infections . miss james said : ` if i had a flare up , i would use the cream all over then it would be at bay for two weeks . ` but when it came back it would be worse than ever . ' eventually , miss james came across the international topical steroid awareness network -lrb- __itsan__ -rrb- which has research showing a link between steroid cream and worsening eczema . ' after discussing with her doctor , miss james stopped using the treatment in may 2014 and is now using other skin creams to calm the eczema . but one of the most surprising and effective treatments she has found is porridge oats . she said : ` now i make a face mask using goat 's milk and porridge oats , it 's really soothing . ' i have __oat__ baths , you just use a pair of old tights to put the oats inside . ` the water looks disgusting but it works for me . ' her home treatment , along with __anti-histamines__ from her gp , have cleared up her eczema on some of her body . she said : ` my face is much better now , and my stomach and legs you ca n't even tell i 've got it . ' however she still has severe eczema on her hands , neck and arms but is hopeful she will have further recovery . despite porridge having helped her , she still wears cotton whenever she can . miss james also credits her the support of her partner of six years , nicola wilson , 26 , with her progress . she said : ` people do n't realise how serious eczema is , they think it 's just red skin that 's a bit itchy ' she said : ` nicola is a teacher so she works long hours and then she comes home and looks after me . ' i ca n't bathe myself because of the condition so she washes me . ` we joke that she 's become my carer . ' however , due to the stress her body is under , and because she scratches patches of eczema on her head , for the past nine months miss james ' hair and eyebrows have been falling out . she now washes her hair just once a week -- with shampoo for thin hair and to stimulate hair growth -- so not to irritate her scalp further and cause more hair loss . she said : ' i have to be careful with my hair as it 's holding on by a thread . i think others in my condition would have shaved their heads . ` it upsets me as i got my hair really long and healthy and then one day it started to fall out . i __back-comb__ it to cover up bald patches . i 'm trying to make the best of it . ' she added : ' i started a blog to document my journey and so many people have been supportive . ` i 'm no longer just the girl with the eczema .

ARTICEL:     scared for her life : model anna __duritskaya__ , 23 , is under police protection in ukraine after reporting a ` threat to her life from unidentified individuals ' ukraine has put the girlfriend of slain russian opposition politician boris nemtsov under state protection after she received death threats . model anna __duritskaya__ , 23 , is now under the guard of __sbu__ secret services and the police . kiev also said today that she would not return to moscow over the probe into the death of the vladimir putin foe . ` we will not let her go back to russia , ' said anton __geraschenko__ , an aide to the interior minister . ` if russian investigators need to talk to her , they will have to come to ukraine . ' the announcement came as another of russia 's leading opposition figures vowed that he and his supporters will not be intimidated by as he walked free from a __15-day__ spell in jail . alexei navalny , who had been convicted of handing out leaflets calling for an opposition rally , said he would continue his staunch criticism of vladimir putin 's government despite the mr nemtsov 's murder seven days ago . emerging unshaven from a moscow detention centre this morning , mr navalny said : ` this act of terror has n't achieved its goal , it will not frighten me or my comrades . we will not reduce our efforts , we will not step back . ' a key figure in boris yeltsin 's 1990s government , mr nemtsov was the most prominent figure in russia 's liberal opposition to be killed during president vladimir putin 's 15-year rule . the 55-year-old was shot four times in the back by a gunman in a passing car as he walked hand-in-hand with miss __duritskaya__ on a bridge across the __moskva__ river on friday night , in the shadow of central moscow 's st basil cathedral . the ukrainian woman - physically unhurt in the attack - revealed the death threats to police in kiev , who said today they were providing her with protection . ` on march 5 , anna __duritskaya__ , who is a witness in the case in the murder of russian opposition politician boris nemtsov , turned to the ukrainian police in the kiev region with a statement on a threat to her life from unidentified individuals , ' said the __prosecutor-general__ 's office in ukraine . the statement offered no information on who might have issued the threats , according to the associated press . the model was staying with her parents since returning to her home country . a relative in ukraine said she was ` in a bad mental state ' . in the aftermath of mr nemtsov 's assassination , miss __duritskaya__ was repeatedly questioned by russian investigators , and she complained that she was held under armed guard and unable to leave the country . however , she returned to ukraine last week . ` this act of terror will not frighten me or my comrades ' : opposition leader alexei navalny said he would continue his staunch criticism of vladimir putin 's government despite the mr nemtsov 's murder . gunned down : boris nemtsov , 55 , -lrb- left -rrb- and 23-year-old miss __duritskaya__ -lrb- right -rrb- were walking hand-in-hand through moscow after having dinner on friday night when he was shot four times in the back . as thousands gathered in moscow to pay their last respects at mr nemtsov 's funeral , putin insisted the russian law enforcement authorities would do ` everything ' to solve the crime . however , nemtsov 's eldest child , __zhanna__ __nemtsova__ , 30 , revealed that investigators had not spoken to a single member of his close family six days after the murder . they believe his ` cruel and __barefaced__ murder ' was because of his political opposition to the kremlin . yesterday a top nato official suggested putin was responsible for mr nemtsov 's death as he accused the russian president of silencing dissent at home while seeking to turn ukraine into a failed state . ` we 've seen that the victims are not just in eastern ukraine , with the brutal murder of boris nemtsov last friday , ' nato deputy secretary general alexander __vershbow__ said . speaking to members of parliament from eu countries at a conference in riga , mr __vershbow__ went on : ` while we do n't know who pulled the trigger , we do know that boris nemtsov was a powerful voice for democracy and against russia 's involvement in ukraine ... -lrb- and -rrb- was among those vilified as `` traitors '' and `` fifth columnists '' in russia 's official propaganda . ' ` we will not let her go back to russia ' : anton __geraschenko__ , an aide to ukraine 's interior minister , said miss __duritskaya__ would not return to moscow over the probe into the death of the vladimir putin foe . honoured : people applaud as workers carry the coffin of kremlin critic boris nemtsov during a ceremony at the __sakharov__ centre in moscow , where his body was laid in state after he was shot dead on friday . mr nemtsov , a father of four , first gained an international profile after being spotted by former british prime minister margaret thatcher as a future leader of russia . he was russia 's deputy prime minister from 1997 to 1998 during boris yeltsin 's presidency , but found himself on the fringes of the country 's politics after a __tanking__ economy forced yeltsin 's resignation . the politician founded a number of opposition movements after leaving the russian parliament in 2003 and he had served as the co-chair of the opposition republican party of russia - people 's freedom party since 2012 . it has been reported that nemtsov angered putin 's government two years ago when he charged that billions of dollars had been stolen from funds designated for the 2014 winter olympics in sochi , his hometown . in january 2011 , he was sentenced to 15 days in jail after being arrested at a new year 's eve protest rally for ` disobedience towards police ' . murder : flowers lie at the scene of mr nemtsov 's murder , while police divers search the __moskva__ river for the gun that was used to gun him down . he was a key figure in russia 's liberal , __pro-west__ opposition . __pro-west__ in his ideology , mr nemtsov had told u.s. diplomats he wanted to take russia on a pro-eu , __pro-nato__ course , including eventual membership of both organisations , according to a diplomatic cable released by wikileaks . ` the key , nemtsov argued , was to present this strategy as the only viable choice for russia , ' wrote a u.s. embassy __attaché__ in the note dated february 2006 . but , the diplomat continued , ` nemtsov also realizes that his association with the yeltsin era will probably limit support for any initiative with his name on it , and he is counting on the next generation of politicians to carry the liberal banner . ' putin has claimed mr nemtsov 's murder - yards from the kremlin - was a ` provocation ' .

ARTICEL:     everywhere you go on the isle of man , you 'll see __manx__ flags - three conjoined white legs on a red background . for the __manx__ , the __triskelion__ is a powerful symbol of independent spirit and endurance , the motto being : ` whichever way you throw , it will stand . ' lately , it 's become a symbol for me too , of three islands . there 's the island i 've called home for the past 11 years , the island i write about in my novels , and somewhere in between , perhaps , a deeper truth about this beautiful rock in the middle of the irish sea . independent spirit : the harbour at ramsey , the isle of man 's second biggest town . legend : a carving of the sea god __manannan__ . can a place with a reputation for being safe and sleepy really also be home to spies , killers and evil spirits that feature in my books ? i like to think so , and here are a few reasons why . the weather might be mixed but the landscape is dramatic , whether seen from the sea , walking the coast path , or taking the electric railway to the top of the island 's solitary mountain , __snaefell__ -lrb- from where , on a clear day , you can see the distant __humped__ __blurs__ of scotland , england , ireland and wales -rrb- . the rich variety of locations is something i 've grown to appreciate in my books , and something the isle of man film industry has thrived on during the past decade . need a spooky cottage ? the island has plenty . the same goes for lush __glens__ and lonely __coves__ . but the island provides more than great backdrops . it 's compact , with a population in the region of 85,000 , and while that makes it ideally manageable for a weekend visit , it also fosters something all writers rely on - rumours and hearsay . my first isle of __man-set__ thriller , safe house , grew out of a rumour i heard almost as soon as i moved here - namely , that it 's used as a place to relocate people enrolled in uk witness protection schemes . is the rumour true ? i do n't know for certain , but it seems credible to me . the island is isolated and has lots of __out-of-the-way__ spots . the isle of man also its own very distinct identity . where else could the population swell for a fortnight every june in celebration of a controversial motorbike festival that pits man against machine over a course run on almost 38 miles of public roads ? the isle of man is isolated , with some out of the way spots , lush __glens__ and lonely __coves__ . racing glory : every summer the island hosts the world-famous tt races , with motorbikes reaching 200mph . the tt -lrb- tourist trophy -rrb- races have been in existence since 1907 , with recent competitors recording top speeds of 200mph . but while most islanders are proud of the long tradition of racing greats who have tamed the course , the event is not without its critics . like many others , i find it hard to reconcile the number of fatalities that have occurred with the racing glory , but i ca n't fail to admire how brave the riders must be . another local oddity is __hop-tunaa__ - the isle of man 's version of halloween . taking place every october 31 , it shares many similarities with halloween , but is still marked by some unique __manx__ twists . for example , __hop-tu-naa__ traditionalists carve lanterns from __turnips__ instead of pumpkins , and children call from door-to-door singing nonsense songs instead of trick-or-treating . in fact , one of the songs was striking enough to become the basis for my new thriller , dark tides . it 's a short step from rumours and hearsay to myths and legends , and the isle of man has some of the most interesting i 've ever heard : from the sea god , __manannan__ , who cloaks the isle in a veil of mist to protect it from outside threats , to the __moddey__ __dhoo__ , a big black hound that haunts peel castle . do n't believe me ? why not come to visit and experience it all for yourself ? isle of man steam packet co __steam-packet__ . com __01624__ __661661__ offers crossings from liverpool and __heynsham__ to douglas . one-way fares start at # 62 for a car and two passengers . for further information go to __visitisleofman.com__ dark tides by chris ewan is out now .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- a lawsuit that 's stirring concern among drinkers of some california wine starts with a history lesson . the deaths of napoleon bonaparte , simon bolivar , king george iii , king faisal i and other prominent figures have been attributed to arsenic poisoning , the first paragraph of the __30-page__ complaint says . and , now , drinkers of some california wine have become `` unwitting ` guinea pigs ' of arsenic exposure , '' thanks to the negligent and misleading actions of dozens of california wineries , according to the class action complaint filed march 19 on behalf of two california couples . the lawsuit does not include any allegations of physical injury or death due to arsenic consumption associated with drinking the wines named in the complaint . the plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and a court order requiring the defendants disclose on the bottles the risks of consuming __inorganic__ arsenic in wines and engage in `` corrective advertising '' regarding their conduct . news of the lawsuit , which broke last week , struck fear in the hearts of frugal wine consumers nationwide , prompting many to share lists on social media of labels named in the lawsuit , all but declaring the outcome a foregone conclusion . the complaint names 28 companies that represent 83 low-cost labels familiar to supermarket wine aisle shoppers : cupcake , __franzia__ , __flipflop__ , rex goliath and __korbel__ , among others . even the maker of trader joe 's charles shaw __zinfandel__ __varietal__ -lrb- affectionately known among fans as `` __two-buck__ chuck '' -rrb- , was called out for allegedly failing to warn consumers that it contained `` dangerously '' high levels of __inorganic__ arsenic . but should consumers start looking to other __winemakers__ or other __wine-producing__ states for __gallon-sized__ bottles of __zinfandel__ ? or is the lawsuit a __fearmongering__ tactic being used to drum up business for the __beverage-testing__ company used for the lawsuit , as some defendants and industry insiders have __insinuated__ ? most of the defendants said their wine was safe to drink when contacted by cnn . some declined to comment , citing the pending litigation . others referred cnn to the wine institute , a california trade group that called the claims `` false and misleading . '' `` we are concerned that the irresponsible publicity campaign by the __litigating__ party could scare the public into thinking that wine is not safe to consume , which is patently untrue , '' said the group , which represents 1,000 california wineries , including 10 of the defendants . the lawsuit alleges that three separate labs `` skilled in arsenic testing '' independently confirmed that the defendants produce wines containing `` dangerously '' high levels of __inorganic__ arsenic , in some cases up to 500 % more than what is considered acceptable . `` put differently , '' the complaint states in bold letters , `` just a glass or two of these __arsenic-contaminated__ wines a day over time could result in dangerous arsenic toxicity to the consumer . '' a spokesman from the public relations firm representing the plaintiffs and __beveragegrades__ , which performed the analysis , said the company is confident that its data is `` based on sound scientific research . '' because the company expects testing methodology to be at issue in litigation , it declined to reveal specific data or testing methods . `` we understand the public interest in this story and look forward to resolving the litigation to make these products safer for consumers . and we hope the __winemakers__ will take these findings just as seriously and work to make sure their wines are safe , '' spokesman rob feldman said . without seeing the lab results , experts suggest reserving judgment based on the following issues to arise from the lawsuit : . arsenic is found in air , soil and water throughout the world . therefore , it can also found in grains , fruits , vegetables and seafood due to absorption through soil and water . `` plants take up trace amounts of arsenic from the soil , and we have been ingesting these trace amounts for all of human history . generally , these amounts are at levels well below that associated with either acute or chronic toxicity , '' said cornell university 's gavin __lavi__ sacks , director of undergraduate studies for the __viticulture__ and __enology__ program in the college of agricultural and life sciences . arsenic occurs in __inorganic__ and organic forms . the fda describes organic or naturally occurring arsenic as `` essentially harmless . '' __inorganic__ arsenic has been classified as a human __carcinogen__ by the environmental protection agency . the first time the u.s. food and drug administration set limits for arsenic levels in food or drink was in 2013 , when it proposed to limit the amount of __inorganic__ arsenic in apple juice to 10 parts per billion . long-term exposure to __inorganic__ arsenic , mainly through smoking , drinking contaminated water , eating food prepared with contaminated water or eating food __irrigated__ with __arsenic-rich__ water , can lead to health risks such as cancer and skin lesions . according to the lawsuit , __inorganic__ arsenic makes up the `` overwhelming majority '' of arsenic in wines at issue , despite the __winemakers__ ' ability to limit __inorganic__ arsenic through `` responsible __winemaking__ procedures '' and `` sophisticated testing equipment . '' without providing specific data , the plaintiffs said their analysis found __inorganic__ arsenic `` far in excess '' of what 's allowed in drinking water based on the epa 's standard for arsenic in drinking water : 10 parts per billion . but the epa limit for water is based on total arsenic , including both organic and __inorganic__ forms , leading some to question whether it 's the best basis for comparison . this standard is set to protect consumers served by public water systems from the effects of long-term , chronic exposure to arsenic , epa spokeswoman tara johnson said in an email . it 's based on how much water people typically drink daily , which ranges from one to two liters , she said . however , the epa standard for arsenic in drinking water `` is of limited use when considering any potential health risks related to arsenic in wine , '' fda spokeswoman lauren __sucher__ said in an email to cnn . `` people drink far more water than they do wine over their lifetimes , and they start drinking water earlier in life . thus , both the amount and period of exposure are different and would require separate analyses , '' she said . seeing as the usda recommends drinking about 10 cups of water a day and no more than two alcoholic drinks -lrb- about 1 cup of wine -rrb- a day , `` a sensible concentration limit for arsenic in wine should be at least __10-fold__ higher than for drinking water , and possibly higher , since we also use water for cooking and cleaning , '' sacks of cornell university said . this is roughly the case in countries that have established limits for arsenic in wine , which leads to the next point : . the u.s. tax and trade bureau regulates the production of alcoholic beverages , and part of this process is testing wine for arsenic , said erika holmes , spokeswoman for washington state university 's __viticulture__ and __enology__ school . even though the fda has not established a standard for acceptable levels of arsenic in wine , california wine exports are tested and found to be below the established limits for export , holmes said in an email . countries that import california wine also test for arsenic using their own standards : 100 parts per billion in canada and 200 parts per billion in europe -- 10 to 20 times higher than the drinking water limit in the united states . `` it 's certainly appropriate to look to other countries ' regulations for guidance , '' sacks said . `` their regulators are presumably looking at the same body of research that u.s. regulators would look to if they were to establish a mandatory limit for wine . '' the day cbs news aired a segment on the lawsuit , the company that performed the analysis sent out a news release offering its services to provide `` reassurance from arsenic in wine '' through `` a tool for screening their offerings to ensure the quality of their supply chain . '' neither __beveragegrades__ nor its ceo , kevin hicks , is a party to the lawsuit . but hicks ' appearance in the segment prompted detractors to cry conflict of interest . in a statement to cnn , hicks said it was concerning that some __winemakers__ would point to this as a conflict of interest `` instead of focusing on making sure their product contains the lowest amount of contaminants possible . '' he also defended his company 's right to offer its services to retailers , saying he will continue to do so . `` the arsenic data in my testing is based on years of scientific research and operating a commercial chemistry lab for over two years . as a commercial lab no one should be surprised that __beveragegrades__ has been offering lab testing services to the alcohol beverage industry since july 2013 . '' a previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the brand barefoot was a named defendant in the lawsuit . it is not . this story has been corrected . cnn sincerely regrets the error .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     a class-action lawsuit alleges some california wines contain unsafe levels of arsenic . __winemakers__ respond that their wines are safe and the suit amounts to __fearmongering__ . arsenic can be dangerous in high concentrations .

ARTICEL:     jenson button found a glimmer of hope in mclaren 's dismal start to the formula one season when he at least finished sunday 's australian grand prix . the briton was last of the 11 cars that completed the race , and was twice lapped by race winner lewis hamilton 's mercedes , but the 2009 world champion saw some positives . ` today has been a good day , ' he said . ` we 're still a long way off , but this is a good starting point -- and i enjoyed the race . i even had a good little battle with __checo__ -lrb- sergio perez -rrb- . mclaren driver jenson button finished last at the season-opening australian grand prix . button waves to the crowd ahead of the race . mclaren have endured a difficult start to the season . ` today also really helps in terms of development . if we 'd done three laps , we 'd have learned nothing , so we 've learned a massive amount by completing a race distance . ' button missed out on a championship point but he said that was almost irrelevant after a weekend when everything went wrong for the sport 's second most successful team , who have not won a race since 2012 . ` it was also a good opportunity for me to get used to the car and to play around with it , making adjustments in the cockpit , ' said the briton , whose longest stint before melbourne had been 12 laps . ` there 's a lot of work still needed - on power , __driveability__ , __downforce__ and set-up - but we can make big strides . and , by improving one area , it tends to snowball . ' mclaren had low expectations after button and kevin magnussen were the slowest qualifiers . things only got worse on sunday when the dane failed to make the grid after his honda power unit blew up on the way to the grid . kevin magnussen is presented to the crowd before the race , but the dane failed to make the start after his honda engine blew on the way to the grid . ` even though i could n't make the start , the team can learn something from my car 's problem , ' said magnussen , who was recalled after fernando alonso was ruled out on medical advice following a crash in testing . ` we can take positives from jenson finishing the race , too - we came here to learn , and that 's what we did . finishing is a small victory for the team - i do n't think we expected to be able to do that . `` now we can get a car to the finish line , we can start to accelerate our learning . ' racing director eric boullier also found a silver lining from a dark weekend . ` it 's not easy to find positives , but in fact there are some , ' he said . ` we can take positives from jenson finishing the race , too -- we came here to learn , and that 's what we did .

ARTICEL:     damaging splits have opened in the upper ranks of the tory party over david cameron 's plan to make a manifesto commitment to slash immigration . the prime minister and home secretary theresa may have become increasingly isolated in their determination to fix a new measure for bringing net migration under control . mr cameron is considering including two different targets in next month 's manifesto -- including a specific target to slash net migration from outside the eu , which , unlike eu migration , ministers can fully control . tory rift : splits have opened in the upper ranks of the tories over david cameron 's plan to make a manifesto commitment to slash immigration - with the prime minister and theresa may becoming increasingly isolated . he is also expected to __re-state__ his commitment to sharply reducing overall net migration . but senior figures , including chancellor george osborne , health secretary jeremy hunt and communities secretary eric pickles are understood to have voiced doubts about the idea . it follows the failure of mr cameron 's 2010 pledge to reduce overall net migration to the ` tens of thousands ' . last week , the figure hit 300,000 -- fuelled in large part by net migration from outside the eu of 190,000 . left-wing tories outside of the cabinet , who are in favour of a more relaxed borders policy , have seized on the figures as their moment to strike . they believe that , in the wake of this __shuddering__ failure , it is easier to make the case for scrapping the target altogether . yesterday , __ex-cabinet__ minister kenneth clarke said : ` we will have to drop the target . it would not be possible to achieve it without damaging our economy quite severely . i 'm afraid that the net migration target has proved to be a mistake . ' george osborne is said to be among __thoseto__ to have voiced doubts about the prime minister 's idea . baroness warsi , a former foreign office minister , added : ` if you set yourself unrealistic targets , you are setting yourself up to fail and , in the long term , turn the whole thing into a bigger issue by fuelling the perception that the government ca n't get a grip . ' but mrs may is understood to believe that giving up on the target would be a huge error , not least because immigration still ranks in the top two concerns of voters . she recently resigned from the advisory board of a prominent conservative think tank , called bright blue , which has publicly criticised the idea of a migration target . in a report , the __right-of-centre__ organisation declared : ` putting an unreliable cap on net migration __centre-stage__ has meant that other measures of competency have been missed and unnoticed . ' its findings were given positive coverage in both the left-wing guardian and independent newspapers . one senior government source , who supports the migration target , said : ` this is the coming fight in the party -- liberal __metropolitans__ versus people who have lived in the real world . ' illegal migrants run on october 29 , 2014 behind a truck to try to board it in calais last october . over the past five years , mrs may has introduced a series of policies to bring migration from outside the eu under control . these included a crackdown on bogus students and sham marriages . however , plans to go further -- including the introduction of bonds for visitors -- were blocked by the treasury and the department for business , innovation and skills . yesterday , immigration minister james brokenshire , an ally of mrs may , dropped strong hints a target would feature in the manifesto so that ` people can measure ' progress made in cutting immigration . he said : ` we do believe very strongly that net migration matters . long-term figures will show you that net migration to this country over the long term has been in that below the 100,000 figure . so , we 're looking very carefully and we will be coming back so people can measure us on what success looks like in terms of our migration policy . ' he added : ` the prime minister has said that we will come back and set out what you can measure us on -- because that 's the key thing -- on how we perform , on controlling our immigration system . ' the number of migrants in calais has dropped by two thirds in recent weeks -- suggesting many have managed to dodge border controls and reach britain . the latest figures reveal that some 2,500 african , asian and eastern europeans were in the french port town over the christmas period but that number has now fallen to around 1,000 . break for the border : migrants try to get into a lorry as it fills up with fuel near calais . last night it emerged that on one day in january alone a fire in the town caused chaos and allowed 300 migrants to sneak through the channel tunnel . a winter storm also caused major problems for border officials when a large section of fencing was blown down near the truck parking area . hundreds more have succeeded in __stowing__ away on trucks and vehicles from french ports such as caen and __cherbourg__ where border controls are less stringent . in recent weeks albanian people smugglers have moved their profitable operations down the coast from calais and managed to load a number of migrants on to lorries at motorway rest areas . a recent head count in calais revealed that only around 1,000 africans , asians and eastern europeans are now sleeping rough and in squats and at three open air camps in calais . shortly after christmas when a similar survey was carried out the number was put at some 2,500 . the french newspaper nord __littoral__ reported over the weekend : ` it is difficult to estimate the number of migrants present in calais but one thing is certain -- it has decreased significantly . '
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     pm is expected to __re-state__ commitment to sharply reduce net migration . but senior figures including george osborne , are voicing doubt over idea . in 2010 campaign mr cameron pledged to reduce overall net migration to ` tens of thousands ' last week the figure hit 300,000 - with 190,000 from outside the eu .

ARTICEL:     youngsters who get themselves saturday jobs like brooklyn beckham or jamie oliver 's kids may end up harming their grades , a report has found . while it may do celebrity children -- like david and victoria beckham 's son , who grabbed a few weekend shifts at a coffee shop -- the world of good to get some work experience , research suggests it could come at a cost to young people 's education . celebrity chef jamie recently revealed he intends to keep his daughters ` real ' by having them work in his pub on the weekends . youngsters who get themselves saturday jobs may end up harming their grades , a report has found . jamie oliver -lrb- pictured with his wife and children -rrb- says he will encourage his kids to work in his pub on weekends . but a new study by the institute for social and economic at the university of essex found teenagers who take on part-time jobs experience a slip in their gcse results . this is because earning extra cash makes it more likely for youngsters to spend it __unwisely__ -- including on alcohol , cigarettes and and cannabis . and the effect was found to be more drastic for girls . despite having millionaires for parents , brooklyn beckham took on weekend shifts at a coffee shop . results showed an extra hour of work per week in year 10 saw their results drop around one grade in one subject the following year . the study analysed the hours these young people spent working and the impact of this on time spent on study time , other activities and their grades at gcse level . dr angus __holford__ , who wrote the report called youth employment and academic performance , says approximately a quarter of 13 to 16-year-olds take on some form of formal paid employment during term time . ` this can be a good thing -- they earn their own money and can pick up useful skills , which might help them find full-time work in the future , ' he said , according to the observer . ` however , they may spend that hard-earned money on less than useful things , or fall in with a different group of people . ` we did find that schoolchildren who worked became more likely to drink alcohol regularly , smoke or consume cannabis . ' he added the long-term effect of employment would be particularly damaging for ` borderline students ' -- those who are at risk of not achieving the targets needed -lrb- five a * - c grades , including english and mathematics -rrb- to progression into further education . dr __holford__ added that as academic results at 16 have such a great influence over future careers , the results of his study should come as a warning to parents who want children to achieve their full potential .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- when american writer __avijit__ roy was hacked to death on a dhaka , bangladesh , street in full view of horrified onlookers , blogger __washiqur__ rahman doubled down . fundamentalists were choking free thought in his secular nation , he wrote . but they could n't silence it . his friends warned him to be careful , to watch what he posted online . but rahman dismissed those concerns , saying his facebook profile page did n't even bear his picture . they do n't even know what i look like , he told them . on monday , the 27-year-old rahman fell victim to the same brazen act that killed roy , hacked to death by two men with knives and meat __cleavers__ just outside his house as he headed to work at a travel agency . he was so maimed -- with wounds to his head , face and neck -- that police identified him through the voter identification card he was carrying . his death was the second time in five weeks that someone was killed in dhaka for online posts critical of islam -- but they are hardly the only two who 've paid a steep price . in the last two years , several bloggers have died , either murdered or under mysterious circumstances . `` the despicable murder of __avijit__ roy last month should have led authorities to step up protection measures for bloggers and others at risk . the killing of __washiqur__ rahman today is another clear example of the bangladeshi government 's utter failure to ensure the safety of those at risk , '' said abbas __faiz__ of amnesty international . `` how many more bloggers will have to be attacked before action is taken ? '' as shocking as rahman 's death was , the reaction from some quarters was equally disturbing . on his facebook page -lrb- for which he picked a custom url that translates to `` __unbeliever__ '' -rrb- , rahman had posted a picture with the hashtag __#iamavijit__ . after his death , someone left a comment , `` now you are . '' another wrote , `` i felt sorry when i first learned of your death . but then i saw what you wrote and i am not . '' on his page , rahman reposted a cartoon depicting prophet mohammed from the french satire magazine charlie hebdo . he wished a happy birthday to author __taslima__ __nasreen__ , who was forced to flee bangladesh due to death threats from fundamentalists . and he `` liked '' a picture of sausages wrapped in crescent rolls that someone had captioned , `` pigs in __burqas__ . '' posts threatening him were numerous . `` get ready for the afterlife , '' one person commented on one of his posts . `` see you in hell , '' said another . he used to write under the pseudonym `` stupid man '' on a blog but switched to posting on facebook after 2011 . on facebook , he is credited for a series , `` __jaw-crushing__ answers to insulting comments of atheists . '' there , he posted questions that critics of islam often raised and then answered them . but he paired the answers in such a way that they highlighted the contradiction within islam . for example , one question asked what proof was there that the quran was the word of god . the answer , `` mohammed said in his own words that the quran is the word of god . since mohammed is the messenger of allah , his claims are true . '' he placed the question next to one that asked , `` what is the proof that mohammed was the messenger of allah ? '' the answer , `` the quran claims that mohammed was the messenger of allah . and since the quran is god 's word , its claims must be true . '' asif __mohiuddin__ , a blogger who himself was wounded by __machete-wielding__ attackers in 2013 but survived , remembered rahman as a great __satirist__ . `` i named him the george carlin of bangladesh , '' he told the international humanist and ethical union . `` he wanted with all his heart , a true secular country , where everyone can practice their freedom . '' the irony is that the people who killed rahman were n't even familiar with his writings ; they were simply following orders , police said . of the three involved in the monday morning attack , two were quickly caught by bystanders . in confessions to police , the pair -- both students at islamic schools -- said they did n't know what a blog was , nor had they seen rahman 's writing . they said they were acting on orders from another person who told them killing rahman was a religious duty , police commissioner __biplob__ kumar __sarkar__ told reporters . the third person is still to be apprehended . that appears to be par for the course in the killings of bloggers in bangladesh . the only person arrested in the killing of roy , the u.s. blogger , is __farabi__ __shafiur__ rahman , who had called for his death in facebook posts . there has been no conviction in the january 2013 attack on __mohiuddin__ . and no convictions in yet another case -- the hacking death of blogger ahmed __rajib__ haider , also in 2013 . `` the bangladeshi government must urgently establish accountability in this murder case and others , '' the committee to project journalists said after rahman 's death . `` otherwise the rest of the country 's bloggers , commentators and journalists covering sensitive topics remain at grave risk of being attacked as well . '' bloggers , unlike political parties , are n't an organized force -- and that makes them an easy target for radicals , said imran __sarker__ , who heads the blogger and online activists network in bangladesh . `` they want peace , they talk of humanity . if you strike them with stones , they do n't strike back . they try to reach you with flowers , '' he said . `` so , if you want to sow fear and stifle progressive thought , they are easy to pick on . '' but the deaths -- of rahman , of roy , of haider -- have emboldened the movement , rather than chill them into silence . `` no one is cowering in their homes because this is happening . because this has been happening regularly for a long time , '' he said . `` we want to take the society forward . we know we have a lot left to accomplish . '' cnn 's omar khan , __kunal__ __sehgal__ and ravi agrawal contributed to this report .

ARTICEL:     jenny __ramage__ , 35 , had nine organs removed in an operation dubbed the ` mother of all surgeries ' after doctors discovered she was suffering a rare form of cancer . over the course of a gruelling nine-hour operation , surgeons meticulously removed 10 organs from jenny __ramage__ 's __cancer-ravaged__ body . one by one they worked to rid the then 32-year-old 's abdomen of a rare and aggressive cancer invading her stomach cavity . her right colon , spleen , gall bladder , ovaries , fallopian tubes , appendix and __umbilicus__ or belly button were removed in their entirety . parts of her liver and diaphragm followed . the drastic operation , dubbed the ` mother of all surgeries ' , left ms __ramage__ with a __14-inch__ scar running down the centre of her body - her ` survival trophy ' . she repeatedly consulted doctors complaining of painful stomach cramps . and she was repeatedly dismissed , the finger pointed at period pains , bloating , appendicitis and irritable bowel syndrome . but the true diagnosis was a grave one - a rare and aggressive cancer was invading ms __ramage__ 's body . a doctor finally noticed a tumour on her appendix , which had burst , and covered her internal organs with __jelly-like__ cancerous cells . experts diagnosed the rare disease __pseudomyxoma__ __peritonei__ -lrb- __pmp__ -rrb- - the same disease which claimed the life of hollywood icon audrey hepburn . she spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics , after making a full recovery . ms __ramage__ , now 35 , and from bristol , said : ` the scar does n't really bother me - i see it as a survival trophy . ' i have been very lucky , i have made a full recovery . ` there 's nothing i ca n't do , nothing i ca n't eat or drink . ` but obviously my fertility was compromised , but i still hope to have children someday with the eggs that were frozen just in time . ' ms __ramage__ 's ordeal began in the spring of 2011 when her periods became very irregular . in late summer of that year , she became very __constipated__ and had a constant feeling like trapped wind on her right side , around her appendix . she later discovered this was the tumour on her appendix pressing against her insides . surgeons removed her colon , spleen , gall bladder , ovaries , fallopian tubes , appendix and __umbilicus__ or belly button as well as part of her liver , kidney and diaphragm . she spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics , after making a full recovery . she went to see a doctor several times but was given a range of different diagnosis - including trapped wind and bad digestion . ' i kept on being fobbed off and told it was ibs , they did n't really know what was wrong with me , ' she said . ` one day i took myself to a&e , because i thought i might have appendicitis . ` they said it was probably just wind , and so i felt silly , as if i was a __hypochondriac__ . ' the cancer was finally discovered after a doctor noticed dozens of abnormal white spots covering her insides during a keyhole investigative test . she said : ` then doctors thought my pains were caused by ovarian cysts , so i had scans which showed i did have cysts on my ovaries . ` but it turns out that 's part and parcel of the disease . ` then they inserted cameras into either side of my tummy to see what was in there . ` when i came around after the procedure , i saw little white spots on the pictures , all over my bladder , uterus and bowel . they were everywhere in my body . hollywood icon audrey hepburn died from the rare disease in switzerland in january 1993 . ` but after that , i did n't hear anything , so i thought it had just been the ovarian cysts , which were removed . ' i was still feeling funny and not well , but i thought it must be nothing . ' i went to the follow up appointment months later and the doctor said it was nothing , but about 30 minutes later i got a frantic call from him . ` he said nurses had been chasing me down the corridor to catch me before i left . ` he had spotted the photographs and noticed the white spots , luckily he 'd seen them . ` for noticing them , i owe him my life really . it all happened very quickly after that . ' ms __ramage__ went under the knife at basingstoke hospital , one of only two hospitals in the country that specialise in treating __pmp__ . ` they discovered when they opened me up that the extent of my disease was much greater than the ct scan had suggested - the tumour was scattered everywhere , from my diaphragm , right down to my bladder , ' she said . the 35-year-old now lives a normal life . but she faces the prospect of not being able to have children , after her fallopian tubes were removed . ` they removed all the visible tumour along with the worst-affected organs including my spleen , half my large bowel , my appendix , gall bladder , ovaries and fallopian tubes , the __peritoneum__ , a bit of my liver and they stripped the surface of my diaphragm . ` they scraped some bits of disease off my bladder and uterus . ` they then pumped a heated chemotherapy solution into my abdominal cavity to kill of any remaining microscopic cancer cells . ' the organs removed in their entirety are not essential to sustain life . __pseudomyxoma__ __peritonei__ -lrb- __pmp__ -rrb- is a rare cancer , affecting around one in 500,000 people a year . it typically begins in the appendix , presenting as a small growth , known as a __polyp__ . in more rare cases it is first detected in other parts of the bowel , the ovary or bladder . the __polyp__ eventually spreads through the wall of the organ from where it has __orginated__ . the disease spreads cancerous cells to the lining of the abdominal cavity - the __peritoneum__ . the cancerous cells produce mucus , which collects in the abdomen as a __jelly-like__ fluid called __mucin__ . that fluid __invades__ the abdominal cavity , causing tumours to spread . there are a number of possible origins of __pmp__ , but the most common source is appendix cancer . there is no known underlying cause of __pmp__ . many patients lack clearly defined symptoms , making the disease difficult to spot until the later stages . the most common symptoms are : . source : __pmp__ research foundation . and from the critical and affected organs , the liver , kidney and diaphragm , doctors only removed what was absolutely necessary . following the surgery , ms __ramage__ underwent another radical procedure , a chemotherapy bath . this is where the stomach cavity is filled with hot chemotherapy liquid for around 90 minutes , while the patient remains under anaesthetic . bathing the inside of the stomach with the heated chemotherapy increases the chances of the cancer cells being killed . heat at 42 °c kills cancer cells without affecting normal , healthy cells . the 35-year-old has made a __full-recovery__ and now lives a normal life . but she faces the prospect of not being able to have children , after her fallopian tubes were removed . as a precaution she did have two sets of eggs frozen a few weeks before her life-changing surgery . determined to help others afflicted by the rare disease , ms __ramage__ has now turned her focus to raising awareness of the condition . she warned the bloating of the abdomen that is one of the symptoms caused as the tumour spreads can be mistaken for ` middle-aged spread ' . ` the more people who know about __pmp__ the more lives can be saved , the more people can be diagnosed and get treatment . it 's all down to a lack of awareness , ' she said . ` if i had n't been diagnosed , it would have suffocated my organs and i would have died . it can be a slow growing cancer or it can kill quite quickly , it depends person to person . ' ms __ramage__ is releasing a music video which she has filmed with other __pmp__ survivors and supporters of the condition . her creation is a 21st-century version of billy joel 's we did n't start the fire . the video will be released on youtube next week and her story can be followed on twitter with the hashtag __#pmponeinamillion__ . for more information about __pmp__ visit the charity __pseudomyxoma__ survivor .

ARTICEL:     british no 1 andy murray is finally __back-to__ his best after an __injury-plagued__ and frustrating 2014 , and is on the verge of __rediscovering__ his best form -- that 's according to mum judy murray . it has been an electric start to the new season for murray -- his quarter-final win against spaniard feliciano lopez last month was enough to see him pass tim henman for the most wins by a british player in the open era -- it was the __497th__ victory of his career at the bnp paribas open in indian wells . murray was also a beaten finalist in this year 's australian open by world no 1 novak djokovic back in january , while after reaching the semi-final in indian wells last week , murray is now the second highest points scorer on the atp tour this year . andy murray poses with fans after his practice at the __crandon__ park in miami . murray practices for his first match at the 2015 miami open at the __crandon__ park . a look at the ` race for london ' confirms this has been a decent start to the year for murray , with him ahead of tomas berdych , stan wawrinka and roger federer , in that order . mum judy -- the current captain of the women 's fed cup team and star of reality television show strictly come dancing -- is convinced murray 's back operation in late 2013 severely hampered his performances across the last 12 months . and she feels son andy , who is marrying kim sears on april 11 in dunblane cathedral , is only just starting to move as he did in 2013 when he lifted the wimbledon title and challenged the supremacy of djokovic as the world 's best player on a near weekly basis . murray is put through his paces ahead of the miami open . murray had a difficult 2014 due to a back injury but is back to his best now according to mum judy . ' 2014 was a difficult year for andy because he was returning from back surgery and any kind of surgery you just do n't recover quickly from , ' said judy murray , speaking at the sse arena at wembley , where she is a mentor for sse 's next generation programme , which provides vital financial and development support to 100 young athletes from across the uk and ireland . ` but i think when it 's in your back it takes a long time to get it to the stage where you can put it through what you need to , to play tennis at the very top level and i think once he got into the back end of the season he finished it very strong . ` he won three tournaments , he qualified for the end of year finals and finished the year at six in the world , which is an incredible achievement considering he had what he would say was an inconsistent season . amelie mauresmo watches murray during practice in miami . ` but then he had a really good off season with his coach amelie mauresmo and played incredible tennis all the way through australia and the preparation events . ` that was a really good sign and it was good to see him back moving well and happy and healthy and playing his best tennis . ` and i think we saw some of his best tennis again at indian wells , which was great to see , so i think he 's back on track and he 's happy and he 's healthy . ' murray is hopeful of adding to his coaching team this week ; with the appointment of former world number four jon __bjorkman__ . the swede will join as an assistant to amelie mauresmo sometime after he finishes his involvement in a swedish television dance show . the arrival of __bjorkman__ to team murray is timely after djokovic dismantled the world no. 4 at indian wells ; the defeat sparked a twitter row with a disgruntled fan and highlighted the urgent improvements needed if the scot is to challenge for grand slam titles again . but mum judy has called on fans to be patient as murray __rebuilds__ his career ; while she is convinced another major title is only just around the corner . ' i think you have to remember that novak is the best player in the world presently and no match against him is ever going to be easy , ' she added . ` andy made the semi-finals of the french open last year and has a good game for clay because he is a great athlete and has a great engine on him . ` growing up , we trained a lot on clay in barcelona . he played a lot on hard courts in scotland , albeit indoors , so that will always be in my opinion his best surface . ` the grass season is very short and less of the top players play well on grass because they do n't have grass courts in their country , so they are not used to it . ` so i think grass always presents itself a big opportunity for any british player . ` but i think andy 's goal is the same as it was when he was a little boy , he wants to win grand slams and he wants to be the best . ` he has a very good record in grand slams over the last four or five years so he will be out there and doing his best . ' sse 's next generation programme partners with __sportsaid__ to provide financial support and training to the sports stars of the future . keep up to date with the latest __@ssenextgen__ .

ARTICEL:     the nfl have fined the atlanta falcons and stripped them of a draft pick following the team 's use of fake crowd noise at home games . in a statement released on monday , the league announced that the falcons have been fined $ 350,000 -lrb- # __237,000__ -rrb- and will forfeit their fifth-round selection in the 2016 draft . if the falcons have multiple picks in that round , the highest selection will be forfeited . team president rich mckay has also been suspended from the league 's competition committee beginning april 1 . atlanta falcons have been fined # __237,000__ for their use of fake crowd noise at the georgia dome . owner arthur blank acknowledged the team 's wrongdoing and described the incident as embarrassing . the nfl noted throughout the 2013 season and into the 2014 season the falcons violated league rules that state ` at no point during the game can artificial crowd noise or amplified crowd noise be played in the stadium . ' the league also said roddy white , the team 's former director of event marketing , was directly responsible for the violation and would have been suspended without pay for the first eight weeks of the 2015 regular season had he still been with the club . the falcons fired him . the league determined that falcons ownership and senior executives , including mckay , were unaware of the use of an audio file with artificial crowd noise . but as the senior club executive overseeing game operations , mckay bears some responsibility for ensuring that team employees comply with league rules . mckay can petition commissioner roger goodell for reinstatement to the committee no sooner than june 30 . the falcons played fake crowd noise during the 2013 and 2014 seasons . falcons president rick mckay has been suspended from his position on nfl competition committee . falcons owner arthur blank said in early february that he had seen enough of the nfl 's investigation to acknowledge wrongdoing by his club . ` it 's not really a fine line , ' blank said . ' i think what we 've done in 2013 and 2014 was wrong . anything that affects the competitive balance and fairness on the field , we 're opposed to , as a league , as a club and as an owner . it 's obviously embarrassing but beyond embarrassing it does n't represent our culture and what we 're about . ' the falcons say 101 of 103 games have been __sellouts__ since blank bought the team in 2002 . actual __turnouts__ declined during losing seasons the last two years . atlanta ranked 10th among the 32 nfl teams with its average home attendance of __72,130__ in 2014 . construction is underway for a new $ 1.4 billion stadium that will replace the georgia dome in 2017 . the new stadium will have a similar seating capacity .

ARTICEL:     a dominatrix based in scotland is challenging a new law in northern ireland that will make it illegal to pay for sex . laura lee , 37 , believes the legislation will put women 's lives in danger by driving prostitution underground . in response , she 's assembled a ` crack team ' of legal experts to fight the legislation all the way to the european court of justice . for the past 18 years , laura has earned her living as a sex worker , travelling between scotland and ireland and juggling the job with motherhood , studying and activism . laura lee , 37 , has worked in the sex industry for 18 years and believes new legislation will put lives in danger . ` the work i do is very diverse , ' laura said . ` i 'm a dominatrix , i provide a `` girlfriend experience '' and i also work with the disabled and terminally ill . ' laura says her clients fall into three categories . ` the first group are what i call my __duracell__ bunnies , ' she said . ` these are the young guys who watch a lot of porn and think that good sex is just how long you can pound away for , which of course it 's not . they can be difficult to deal with but they 're good fun . ' i see a lot of guys in their 50s who got married at 20 and found the sex died off . it can be because they drifted apart from their wife but , in some cases , it 's __sadder__ ; the wife may have developed a degenerative condition like alzheimer 's or ms or parkinson 's . ` sometimes it 's on their conscience for a long time before they contact me but they 've come to the conclusion that it 's better for everybody . laura says her clients fall into three categories - including ` __duracell__ bunnies ' who ` pound away ' until june 1 , laws governing prostitution in northern ireland remain similar to the rest of the uk and the republic of ireland . this means that prostitution itself is legal , but most activities associated with it -lrb- such as soliciting in a public place or running a brothel -rrb- are illegal . once the human trafficking and exploitation act comes into force , it will be illegal for consenting adults to pay for sex in northern ireland . ` the third category are my older guys . they 're usually widows , terribly lonely , and they just want cuddles and company more than anything else . ' laura is careful when choosing her clients , ensuring that she 's safe and that men are clear about what the session will involve , especially when they 're booking her as a dominatrix . ' i get a good grasp __before-hand__ of what they 're expecting , ' she said . ` we pretty much agree a scenario but part of my job as a dominatrix is encouraging people to push their boundaries . this could be through things like spanking , __caning__ , cross-dressing or role play . ' at the moment , transactions like this between laura and her northern irish clients are legal . however , from june 1 , a new law will mean that men who pay laura for sex could be arrested . the legislation is being championed by democratic unionist peer lord morrow . it will make northern ireland the first region in the uk to ban payment for sex between consenting adults . laura says she is a dominatrix providing a ` girlfriend experience ' the so-called ` swedish model ' -- which makes it illegal to buy sex , but not to sell it -- has been heavily criticised by groups including the world health organisation and amnesty international . they say there 's no evidence it works and that , instead , it causes real harm to women . police in northern ireland are not backing the legislation and the justice minister , david ford , has said to will be hard to enforce . importantly , a department of justice commissioned survey revealed that 98 per cent of sex workers are opposed to the law . ` even women who 've suffered terribly within the trade agreed that sometimes what 's needed is refuge and rehab not the __criminalisation__ of clients , ' laura said . the law is being brought in as a solution to sex trafficking , although the department of justice report suggested that less than 1 percent of those involved in the sex trade had been forced into it . last year , there were no recorded incidents of sex trafficking in northern ireland but there were 70 recorded incidences of violence against sex workers . laura is worried this violence is about to increase as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest . the main fear is of an increase in violence and vulnerability as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest . ` lord morrow has effectively said that he really could n't care less about the welfare of sex workers , ' she said . once the law comes in , the __crusading__ dominatrix and her team of expert lawyers will take their case first to northern ireland 's high court and finally to the european court of human rights . the team will challenge the legislation on several articles . they are hoping to prove that lord morrow 's law __contravenes__ the european convention on human rights , including the rights to privacy , health and protection from degrading treatment . the law may even flout the human right to life . if prostitution becomes more hidden and dangerous , laura has no doubt that deaths will follow . ` sex workers are going to suffer , ' she said . ' i witnessed the effects of the 1993 legislation when i was working in dublin . as soon as legislation came in making it an offence to solicit , violence against sex workers skyrocketed and it was n't too long before -lsb- 21-year-old sex worker -rsb- sinead kelly was stabbed to death by a client . ' last year , a similar law was proposed in the uk by mp fiona __mactaggart__ . but after a campaign by the english collective of prostitutes -lrb- __ecp__ -rrb- , the sex worker open university and the women 's institute the bill was dropped without even going to a vote . laura watson of the __ecp__ said they are behind laura lee 's fight in northern ireland . ` internationally , sex workers are challenging discriminatory prostitution laws which force us to work in isolation and increased danger , ' she said . ` legal challenges , spearheaded by sex workers , are a vital tool in our armoury to win justice and protection .

ARTICEL:     jenny __ramage__ , 35 , had nine organs removed in an operation dubbed the ` mother of all surgeries ' after doctors discovered she was suffering a rare form of cancer . over the course of a gruelling nine-hour operation , surgeons meticulously removed 10 organs from jenny __ramage__ 's __cancer-ravaged__ body . one by one they worked to rid the then 32-year-old 's abdomen of a rare and aggressive cancer invading her stomach cavity . her right colon , spleen , gall bladder , ovaries , fallopian tubes , appendix and __umbilicus__ or belly button were removed in their entirety . parts of her liver and diaphragm followed . the drastic operation , dubbed the ` mother of all surgeries ' , left ms __ramage__ with a __14-inch__ scar running down the centre of her body - her ` survival trophy ' . she repeatedly consulted doctors complaining of painful stomach cramps . and she was repeatedly dismissed , the finger pointed at period pains , bloating , appendicitis and irritable bowel syndrome . but the true diagnosis was a grave one - a rare and aggressive cancer was invading ms __ramage__ 's body . a doctor finally noticed a tumour on her appendix , which had burst , and covered her internal organs with __jelly-like__ cancerous cells . experts diagnosed the rare disease __pseudomyxoma__ __peritonei__ -lrb- __pmp__ -rrb- - the same disease which claimed the life of hollywood icon audrey hepburn . she spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics , after making a full recovery . ms __ramage__ , now 35 , and from bristol , said : ` the scar does n't really bother me - i see it as a survival trophy . ' i have been very lucky , i have made a full recovery . ` there 's nothing i ca n't do , nothing i ca n't eat or drink . ` but obviously my fertility was compromised , but i still hope to have children someday with the eggs that were frozen just in time . ' ms __ramage__ 's ordeal began in the spring of 2011 when her periods became very irregular . in late summer of that year , she became very __constipated__ and had a constant feeling like trapped wind on her right side , around her appendix . she later discovered this was the tumour on her appendix pressing against her insides . surgeons removed her colon , spleen , gall bladder , ovaries , fallopian tubes , appendix and __umbilicus__ or belly button as well as part of her liver , kidney and diaphragm . she spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics , after making a full recovery . she went to see a doctor several times but was given a range of different diagnosis - including trapped wind and bad digestion . ' i kept on being fobbed off and told it was ibs , they did n't really know what was wrong with me , ' she said . ` one day i took myself to a&e , because i thought i might have appendicitis . ` they said it was probably just wind , and so i felt silly , as if i was a __hypochondriac__ . ' the cancer was finally discovered after a doctor noticed dozens of abnormal white spots covering her insides during a keyhole investigative test . she said : ` then doctors thought my pains were caused by ovarian cysts , so i had scans which showed i did have cysts on my ovaries . ` but it turns out that 's part and parcel of the disease . ` then they inserted cameras into either side of my tummy to see what was in there . ` when i came around after the procedure , i saw little white spots on the pictures , all over my bladder , uterus and bowel . they were everywhere in my body . hollywood icon audrey hepburn died from the rare disease in switzerland in january 1993 . ` but after that , i did n't hear anything , so i thought it had just been the ovarian cysts , which were removed . ' i was still feeling funny and not well , but i thought it must be nothing . ' i went to the follow up appointment months later and the doctor said it was nothing , but about 30 minutes later i got a frantic call from him . ` he said nurses had been chasing me down the corridor to catch me before i left . ` he had spotted the photographs and noticed the white spots , luckily he 'd seen them . ` for noticing them , i owe him my life really . it all happened very quickly after that . ' ms __ramage__ went under the knife at basingstoke hospital , one of only two hospitals in the country that specialise in treating __pmp__ . ` they discovered when they opened me up that the extent of my disease was much greater than the ct scan had suggested - the tumour was scattered everywhere , from my diaphragm , right down to my bladder , ' she said . the 35-year-old now lives a normal life . but she faces the prospect of not being able to have children , after her fallopian tubes were removed . ` they removed all the visible tumour along with the worst-affected organs including my spleen , half my large bowel , my appendix , gall bladder , ovaries and fallopian tubes , the __peritoneum__ , a bit of my liver and they stripped the surface of my diaphragm . ` they scraped some bits of disease off my bladder and uterus . ` they then pumped a heated chemotherapy solution into my abdominal cavity to kill of any remaining microscopic cancer cells . ' the organs removed in their entirety are not essential to sustain life . __pseudomyxoma__ __peritonei__ -lrb- __pmp__ -rrb- is a rare cancer , affecting around one in 500,000 people a year . it typically begins in the appendix , presenting as a small growth , known as a __polyp__ . in more rare cases it is first detected in other parts of the bowel , the ovary or bladder . the __polyp__ eventually spreads through the wall of the organ from where it has __orginated__ . the disease spreads cancerous cells to the lining of the abdominal cavity - the __peritoneum__ . the cancerous cells produce mucus , which collects in the abdomen as a __jelly-like__ fluid called __mucin__ . that fluid __invades__ the abdominal cavity , causing tumours to spread . there are a number of possible origins of __pmp__ , but the most common source is appendix cancer . there is no known underlying cause of __pmp__ . many patients lack clearly defined symptoms , making the disease difficult to spot until the later stages . the most common symptoms are : . source : __pmp__ research foundation . and from the critical and affected organs , the liver , kidney and diaphragm , doctors only removed what was absolutely necessary . following the surgery , ms __ramage__ underwent another radical procedure , a chemotherapy bath . this is where the stomach cavity is filled with hot chemotherapy liquid for around 90 minutes , while the patient remains under anaesthetic . bathing the inside of the stomach with the heated chemotherapy increases the chances of the cancer cells being killed . heat at 42 °c kills cancer cells without affecting normal , healthy cells . the 35-year-old has made a __full-recovery__ and now lives a normal life . but she faces the prospect of not being able to have children , after her fallopian tubes were removed . as a precaution she did have two sets of eggs frozen a few weeks before her life-changing surgery . determined to help others afflicted by the rare disease , ms __ramage__ has now turned her focus to raising awareness of the condition . she warned the bloating of the abdomen that is one of the symptoms caused as the tumour spreads can be mistaken for ` middle-aged spread ' . ` the more people who know about __pmp__ the more lives can be saved , the more people can be diagnosed and get treatment . it 's all down to a lack of awareness , ' she said . ` if i had n't been diagnosed , it would have suffocated my organs and i would have died . it can be a slow growing cancer or it can kill quite quickly , it depends person to person . ' ms __ramage__ is releasing a music video which she has filmed with other __pmp__ survivors and supporters of the condition . her creation is a 21st-century version of billy joel 's we did n't start the fire . the video will be released on youtube next week and her story can be followed on twitter with the hashtag __#pmponeinamillion__ . for more information about __pmp__ visit the charity __pseudomyxoma__ survivor .

ARTICEL:     -lrb- cnn -rrb- as a november dawn breaks over an irish bar in downtown new york , the early __risers__ inside are hunkered down to watch lewis hamilton begin his chase for a second formula one world title . it 's mid-morning in brazil and melissa , her husband alex and their four-year-old daughter are also glued to the tv to watch their hero in the season-ending abu dhabi grand prix . on the verdant reunion island in the indian ocean , three thousand miles from the desert showdown , another hamilton fan anxiously waits for the mercedes man to race to his fate . these supporters , and others around the world from estonia to south africa , had voiced their hopes in video messages and their __supplications__ on social media . when hamilton flicked down his visor , revved the mercedes ' engine and hit the throttle , a global surge of support roared . `` we came out at 6am on sunday morning to watch the race in a bar in manhattan , '' new yorker , and self confessed no. 1 hamilton fan , christopher thomas told cnn . `` we met up with fans from all over ; we had a guy from the uk and one guy even took a bus from boston just to watch the race . `` we also made videos and sent them to lewis ' website using the hashtag __teamlh__ . '' in brazil , self-styled melissa `` hamilton , '' who is married to alex `` senna , '' also used the hashtag to communicate with her idol . she told cnn : `` i support lewis every day but during the races i am aware of everything , even practice and all the interviews . `` at all times he knows he can count on our support , in good times or bad . i am extremely proud to be a fan of his . '' when hamilton won in abu dhabi -- in easier circumstances than expected thanks to an engine problem for rival nico rosberg -- and sealed the 2014 championship he was quick to thank his fans in the post-race media conference . `` i always say we win and lose together , '' he smiled . `` the love and energy that i get from my fans ... it really made me believe that i can do anything . '' racing in a global championship has helped hamilton gain fame across international borders . in 2015 , the f1 series will visit an __air-mile__ clocking 20 countries . but when the 30-year-old briton lines up for sunday 's season-opening australian grand prix , he will do so as the most famous face on the grid . `` lewis has over three million facebook fans -- with a third of those coming from the uk -- and he has 2.6 million twitter followers , '' explained jon __stainer__ , managing director of leading sports and entertainment market research company __repucom__ . `` he has a very strong following . compared to other f1 drivers , lewis is also right up there in most of the sport 's key markets in terms of celebrity awareness . `` in the big markets -- brazil , china , india and the uk -- he scores in the top three . fernando alonso is the only other -lsb- ever-present -rsb- driver . '' tom __roope__ , whose company __rumpus__ room runs hamilton 's digital media , decided to tap into the racing star 's global appeal in the build-up to the sizzling abu dhabi finale . `` we saw that lewis ' fans were talking to one another and so we came up with the protocol __#teamlh__ , '' explains __roope__ . __rumpus__ room then devised a real time app , which enabled them to record and upload video messages of support . these twin projects enabled __roope__ and his team to have a better understanding of the geography and demographic of hamilton 's followers . `` his fanbase is enormously international , '' he said . `` around 50 % of them are from the uk but then there are a lot in asia , brazil and the u.s. 30,000 fans uploaded videos from 50 countries . `` there was also a surprisingly high female following , which is probably connected to -lsb- his former girlfriend popstar -rsb- nicole scherzinger . '' the video messages was then edited into four films , which were broadcast daily on hamilton 's social platforms over the race weekend . the final film on race day had a million views on facebook in one day alone . our story . here it is . __#teamlhmovie__ . thank you all so much __#teamlh__ __@mercedesamgf1__ . __https://t.co/hbuit4jrrw__ . hamilton himself explained the concept , and the emotional response it generated within him , after the race . `` this weekend the guy who does my website put together a collage of different clips of messages from people , '' he said . `` i really did n't know what to expect . when i got it there was something happening in my heart . i ca n't really explain it . '' thomas and his fiancée __julliana__ sanchez , as well as melissa and her family and the reunion island fan , were featured in the films . `` it was important to us personally , '' thomas said . `` it 's a big deal for us making a video and seeing him acknowledge his fans . '' thomas , who is originally from guyana in south america , has also been __galvanizing__ global support for hamilton through social media for the last five years . he explained : `` the idea __percolated__ at the canadian grand prix in 2010 . my brother-in-law __shaka__ had a huge painted banner -- it looked like something a five-year-old did -- but at the bottom it said ' __#lewisnation__ -- we believe . ' `` we started using it and twitter was soon blown up with __#lewisnation__ . the initial idea was to unite crew members in north america but when i go on twitter and facebook i see people from india , the philippines , the uk and germany . `` it 's a global base and we are trying to make it bigger . right now , we use __#lewisnation__ to meet up at races but we 've started work on a website . '' hamilton 's mass appeal is not just because he 's an f1 driver and now a double world champion . he has something the other 17 drivers simply do n't have -- a narrative to rival a bestselling novel , a blockbuster script . born in stevenage , a commuter town 30 miles north of london , he broke boundaries when he debuted in 2007 as f1 's first black driver . he revealed on his website when his career began he `` tried to ignore that fact '' but has now `` really started to appreciate the implications . '' hamilton 's mixed heritage -- his mother is white british and his father 's family have roots in the caribbean -- and a __rags-to-riches__ success story have both helped him connect with a wider fanbase . `` there 's a crossover that appeals to many , many backgrounds , '' said thomas . `` he 's diverse , but not just -lsb- in -rsb- race but in his social __likings__ too . `` he hangs out with top celebrities like jay-z and kanye west . this hip-hop style and the fact that he spends a lot of time in the u.s. make him one of the few drivers who actually appeals to americans . '' __roope__ agreed : `` lewis is a bit different . he invites a whole new set of people into f1 , people who might be put off by the rich , white , __middle-classness__ of it all . '' hamilton has also always worn his heart on his sleeve against a backdrop of fierce racing rivalry -- usually with his teammates -- and an on-off romance with scherzinger . there have been some mesmerizing moments on track , and some famous meltdowns off it . perhaps most remembered was his outburst at the 2011 monaco grand prix . hamilton had been penalized by race stewards after finishing sixth and exclaimed to the media : `` it 's an absolute __frickin__ ' joke . maybe it 's because i 'm black . that 's what ali g says . '' many of hamilton 's fans -- though not all -- warm to these moments of human frailty as much as his __derring-do__ on the racetrack , and draw inspiration from both . melissa races go __karts__ in brazil and , although she credits her husband alex for his practical support , she also takes heart from hamilton . `` lewis is a fighter , he faced many prejudices and difficult days but he never gave up on his dream ; he teaches us that , '' melissa explained . `` in addition to his talent as a wonderful driver , he has a big heart , a great willpower . `` many friends are astonished to see me kart racing because i dispute championships with many men , and women on the track are in the minority . `` i win often but women suffer some kind of prejudice . i do not really care , i care to always do my best and be inspired by the best drivers . '' melissa has met hamilton at many brazilian grands prix . `` all my meetings with lewis are fantastic and happy . he is a charismatic and kind person . he really loves his fans . '' thomas , like melissa , has met hamilton `` tonnes of times '' in and around grand prix weekends . `` he seems like a down to earth guy , '' thomas revealed . `` he 's not one of those guys who signs an autograph and __shoves__ it back to you . he actually talks and spends time with you . '' thomas and his fiancée sanchez are so impressed with the british racer that they graced him with a special honor . `` the first person we invited verbally to our wedding was lewis , '' thomas explained . `` we met him in the pit lane at the u.s. grand prix last year , he hung out with us , took selfies and we alluded to the fact that we were getting married and said ` hey you 're the first invite . ' `` we are trying to set a date around the summer break . we ca n't set the date on a race weekend !

ARTICEL:     traveling is meant to be one of the most exciting events in a person 's life . but more and more frustrated australians are ditching their travel plans and spending more time searching than they are on their actual holiday , a new study has found . a survey of 1000 people across the country by travel search engine kayak found that one in four aussies spend the equivalent of more than half their annual leave researching and planning their trip . travel agents ' interests , the overload of information online , hidden costs and fluctuating prices were found to be making __holiday-bookers__ extra cautious with their plans . about 38 per cent of people admitted they spend more time looking for flights and hotels then researching the activities they hope to do on the trip . one in four aussies , like sydney marketing manager sam kelly -lrb- pictured on his last trip to bali -rrb- , spend the equivalent of more than half their annual leave researching and planning their holidays . sydney marketing manager sam kelly , admitted that the number of hours it took him to plan his last trip to bali amounted to two weeks worth of working hours . ' i spend a lot of time - hours and hours - it 's a big process . i do n't go on budget holidays , but i 've saved thousands of dollars by going through this process , ' he told daily mail australia . the 27-year-old said that he spent the time researching potential hotels and destinations by looking at various booking sites and reviews , adding that despite enjoying the process , he found it took up a ` ridiculous amount of time ' . ` it 's the amount of information out there . one website that will do that __legwork__ for you and get you the best hotel prices , show you reviews and airfares all in the one currency - one true source of truth - would be ideal , ' he said . mr kelly admitted that it was during office hours that most of his searching and booking occurred , and he 's not alone . according to kayak 26 per cent of those surveyed from canberra did the same thing - a figure which almost three times the national average . it also found that 31 per cent of people have resorted to completely abandoning their travel plans and bookings due to their frustration . investment banker todd __fortescue__ came close to doing so himself when he and his girlfriend found themselves constantly bickering after becoming frustrated with travel agents helping them with their trip to canada earlier this year . the 27-year-old said there was an information overload online and admitted that he did a lot of research for his flights and hotels while at work . instead , the couple ditched their travel agent , choosing to find their own booking deals online . ` we were getting frustrated that we were n't getting anywhere with booking and that it was costing more than we had anticipated and were thinking that maybe we should postpone it for a year when we had more time and knew exactly what we wanted , ' mr __fortescue__ told daily mail australia . ` we went to a travel agent to get assistance and gave them an outline of what we wanted but some of them would give us all these different stories about why they did n't have accommodation in certain areas . it seemed like they were working on commission with hotels because when we looked into the areas ourselves , we found plenty of options . ` there was this constant back and forth of emails and some agents were in different time zones and the more time we wasted the more money we wasted as we got closer to the dates . it was much cheaper when we did it ourselves . ' hidden costs were found to be one of the highest ranked frustrations for __holiday-bookers__ , worse than fluctuating prices and information overload . overall , kayak found that 86 per cent of the people they surveyed ` spend the same amount of time or more planning and booking holidays than they did three years ago ' , but that more than half reported their holiday satisfaction had declined or stayed the same .
REFERENCE SUMMARY:     a quarter of 1000 __holiday-bookers__ surveyed take two weeks to plan a trip . meanwhile 31 per cent admitted to ditching their bookings in frustration . travel agents ' interests , the overload of information online , hidden costs and fluctuating prices were found to be making aussies extra cautious .

' researchers examined bmi , healthy diet , total cholesterol and blood pressure -- four of the seven components of heart health -- in children aged two to 11 . in the sample of __8,961__ children , the researchers found that all children had at least one ideal measure , but none had all four . an ideal diet score was the least prevalent health indicator , with less than one per cent of children having four or five of the five components of a healthy diet . the experts warned people are losing a lot of ` intrinsic ' heart health very early in life , setting them up to be unhealthy adults . the five indicators of a healthy diet include low intake of __sugar-sweetened__ drinks and salt , and high intake of __wholegrains__ , fish , plus fruit and vegetables . fewer than 10 per cent ate the recommended amounts of fruit and veg of more than 4.5 cups or more per day or fish , and __wholegrains__ were the least frequently achieved component with just three per cent of boys and 2.4 per cent of girls hitting the target . ninety per cent ate more salt than recommended , and more than half consumed more than the recommended number of calories from __sugar-sweetened__ drinks . around four out of ten of the children had ` poor ' or ` intermediate ' cholesterol levels , according to the findings published in the journal circulation : cardiovascular quality and outcomes . researchers found ideal blood pressure was the most common favourable measure of cardiovascular health , ranging from 88 per cent to 93 per cent across sex and racial groups . previous studies have shown worsening indicators of cardiovascular health , starting in adolescence and continuing through adulthood . dr __lloyd-jones__ added : ` we really need better surveillance data , especially in children . ` information on physical activity , blood glucose and smoking or exposure to second-hand smoke are not available for younger children . ` without knowing how much physical activity a child is doing , and therefore how many calories are needed , we ca n't scale the diet metrics to a child 's needs . ` so we used the adult metrics , but understand that it would be difficult for a five-year-old to take in as many fruits and vegetables as an adult . ` the bottom line is that we need even better data , but what we do see is that we are losing an awful lot of our intrinsic cardiovascular health very early in life , which sets us up to be unhealthy adults . '

ARTICEL:     this is the dramatic moment four fearless indian bison managed to avoid certain death by chasing a giant tiger away from their herd . __praveen__ __siddannavar__ , 47 , captured the stunning shots as the indian bison , also known as __gaurs__ , teamed up to frighten away their would-be killer at the __nagarahole__ tiger reserve in the __karnataka__ state of india . the photographer , from bangalore , says he looked on with amazement as the animals clashed near a water puddle - with the __gaurs__ standing their ground before the tiger made a run for it . the chase : the group of indian bison teamed up to frighten away their would-be killer at the __nagarahole__ tiger reserve in india . on the prowl : the tiger was walking in the open , heading straight towards a water pipe where the group of bison were having a drink . on high alert : one of the __gaurs__ picked up on the scent of the approaching tiger and made all the others aware of its presence . speaking of the incident , mr __siddannavar__ said : ' i was enjoying a late afternoon drive and after scanning the forest and i drove to the sunset point on the __backwaters__ of river __kabini__ that had gone completely dry due to poor __monsoons__ ' . ' i was fortunate to spot a huge tiger resting underneath the shade of dried bamboo bushes , ' he added . ` after a while the tiger started walking in the open and loud alarm calls were given by spotted deer and also the __sambar__ deer . the tiger ignored these calls and headed straight towards the __culvert__ -lsb- water pipe -rsb- to cool himself in a puddle , ' he went on to say . mr __siddannavar__ said that a herd of __gaurs__ were heading the same way to __quench__ their thirst - a sight that ` really excited ' him as he knew he was going to see some action . one of the __gaurs__ then picked up on the scent of the tiger and they were all alerted . ` the __gaurs__ seemed uncomfortable upon seeing the tiger and decided to launch an offensive attack , ' the photographer said . not going easy : the __gaurs__ were uncomfortable at the presence of the massive tiger and decided to launch an offensive attack . running scared : as soon as the four indian bison charged at their would-be killer , the tiger decided he was n't going to hang around . filled with fear : the four bison chased the tiger , who seemed more interested in saving his own life than making a kill . mr __siddannavar__ said the the entire herd of __gaurs__ stormed towards the tiger , after first snorting aggressively . as soon as the animals charged , the photographer said , their would-be killer decided to run away . ' the photographer admitted he was stunned to see the tiger backing away from its prey and said the __gaurs__ proved to be a formidable force . ` what an unbelievable sight this was - i have never seen such action-packed drama before , ' mr __siddannavar__ said . ` tigers are apex predators - meaning they are at the top of the food chain in the forest ecosystem , ' he added . great defence : __praveen__ __siddannavar__ said the the entire herd of __gaurs__ stormed towards the tiger , after first snorting aggressively . safe : after being chased away from the scene , the tiger went back to sheltering under the safety of dry bamboo trees . all in a day 's work : after seeing off the tiger , the __gaurs__ wandered off into the __nagarahole__ tiger reserve , in india 's __karnataka__ state . mr __siddannavar__ said __gaurs__ are not normally scared of other animals , but taking on a tiger showed particular unity , strength and bravery . ` tigers hunt __gaurs__ regularly but it was amazing to see them working together - their strength lies in numbers and unity plays a key role in fending a tiger away , ' he said . ` it really surprised me to see the tiger running away as tigers rarely back off as they are the kings of the jungles , ' he added . ` but because it was a group of four __gaurs__ and they attacked from all ends , the tiger had no option but to run away to save his life . ' photographer : __praveen__ __siddannavar__ , 47 , says he looked on with amazement as the animals clashed near a water puddle - with the __gaurs__ standing their ground before the tiger made a run for it .

ARTICEL:     the probe into an alleged paedophile network at the heart of the british establishment took an explosive turn last night with the revelation that enoch powell 's name has been passed to police . the mail on sunday can reveal that the late tory mp , one of the most prominent and divisive politicians of the 20th century , has been named to scotland yard by the bishop of durham . the claims relate to ` ritual satanic abuse ' . and in a further development to the __sex-ring__ investigations , police are to be given access to secret files held on mps in the house of commons archives as they hunt for evidence on suspected abusers , including former liberal mp cyril smith . scroll down for video . historic : enoch powell 's name was first linked to sex abuse claims in the 1980s . the bishop of durham , paul butler , contacted police after powell 's name was passed to him by a former bishop of monmouth , dominic walker , who first heard the allegation when he was a vicar counselling young adults in the 1980s . the claim is being examined by operation __fenbridge__ , one of a number of police probes into ` establishment paedophile rings ' -- including an investigation by the independent police complaints commission into claims that officers dropped their inquiries under pressure from powerful individuals . a church of england spokesman said : ` the name of enoch powell was passed to operation __fenbridge__ by one of our safeguarding team on the instruction of bishop paul butler . ' mr walker is believed to have warned the right rev butler that at the time he was told of the claims against powell , unsubstantiated allegations of satanic rituals -- often involving the abuse of children -- were widespread . in 1994 , an investigation by the london school of economics into 84 alleged cases of ` satanic abuse ' in the uk between 1987 and 1992 , including notorious cases in rochdale and the __orkneys__ that involved social workers and police forcibly removing children from their homes in dawn raids , found no convincing __corroborative__ evidence . report : paul butler , the bishop of durham , passed the name to scotland yard after hearing it from the former bishop of monmouth . however , the ongoing scandal over how serial paedophile jimmy savile was able to evade detection for decades has led institutions to take a __safety-first__ approach , so the church felt it had no option but to pass on the information to police . enoch powell 's frontline political career ended abruptly in 1968 after he made his infamous ` rivers of blood ' speech warning about the dangers of uncontrolled immigration . tory leader edward heath sacked him from the shadow cabinet the following day , although powell remained an mp until 1974 . shortly after he died in 1998 , aged 85 , it was revealed he had admitted to a friend , canon eric james , that love poetry he had written as a youth had been intended for a man -- but that he did not want the fact revealed while he was alive . although powell became a hero of the right , his intellectual and __oratorical__ skills earned him admirers on both sides of the political divide . a devout member of the church of england , he had two daughters with his wife pamela . sources close to one of scotland yard 's __sex-ring__ investigations say officers contacted lawrence ward , the commons __serjeant__ at arms -- the commons ' most senior security official -- earlier this month to ask him to search the files kept on all mps . it is understood that no information was uncovered implicating mps in abuse , sparking fears at scotland yard that some of the evidence might have been shredded . now mr ward is believed to have told officers that , if they produce a warrant , they can enter the commons to investigate the files themselves on a ` case by case basis ' . last night , simon __heffer__ , powell 's official biographer and former confidante , branded the allegations ` absolute nonsense ' and without foundation .
