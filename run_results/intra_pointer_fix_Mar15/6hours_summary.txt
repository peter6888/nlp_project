INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  true meaning of easter : the eggs were backed by archbishop of york john sentamu , who is urging the supermarkets to rethink . supermarkets have been accused of pursuing an ` __anti-__ christian agenda ' after refusing to sell easter eggs with a religious message . some of britain 's biggest stores are celebrating the most profound event in the church calendar by offering treats featuring everything from darth vader to postman pat -- but turned down products that mention jesus . one chain even asked ` what has easter got to do with the church ? ' , according to the makers of the real easter egg , which features christian crosses on the box and contain a leaflet telling the story of the resurrection . now archbishop of york john sentamu has stepped in -- urging sainsbury 's , asda and the co-op to stock the charity eggs -- while former archbishop of canterbury george carey said he was ` saddened ' by the three supermarket giants ' decision . lord carey said : ` the rest are rubbish . these easter eggs that have nothing to do with easter , all they are trying to do is get more money out of people . they have no meaning . i think it shows ignorance on the part of these supermarkets . ` by not offering an alternative to secular easter eggs they are really undermining the real message of easter . it saddens me because we are living in a land that is completely losing contact with its religious roots and is out of touch with the christian message . ' david marshall , the head of the meaningful chocolate company , said the supermarkets appeared biased against its ` proven seller ' . he said : ` we do wonder at times if there is an __anti-christian__ agenda from some of our supermarkets who just keep turning it down . it is as if some feel christianity is politically incorrect or the easter story , which mentions jesus , might put people off . ` one buyer asked us what easter had got to do with the church , while another simply said , `` i do n't think this is a credible product '' and asked us to leave . ' the __warrington-based__ firm has spent five years trying to persuade stores to sell its # 4 __christian-themed__ eggs , which were launched in 2010 with the backing of archbishop sentamu . at first the supermarkets refused , but two years ago , tesco , morrisons , sainsbury 's , waitrose and the co-op bowed to pressure and agreed . but this year sainsbury 's and the co-op have dropped the eggs , blaming poor sales , while asda has never stocked them . however , the meaningful chocolate company say a million eggs have been sold over the past five years . ` poor sales ' : sainsbury 's and co-op have cited poor sales as the reason they dropped the eggs , while asda said it has not be approached by the makers of the egg . archbishop sentamu , who has lamented ignorance about easter after learning that a third of children thought it marked the birthday of the easter bunny , said yesterday : ` with a million real easter eggs sold i am delighted that morrisons , tesco and waitrose have met the challenge . i call on sainsbury 's , asda , and the co-operative to give their customers the same choice . ' sainsbury 's said their decision was based on ` the popularity of ranges in previous years ' , with the co-op also citing ` poor sales of the real easter egg in previous years ' . asda said it had not been approached this year , a claim disputed by the meaningful chocolate company .
INFO:tensorflow:REFERENCE SUMMARY: several major supermarkets refuse to stock charity 's the real easter egg . the egg features christian crosses and a leaflet on the resurrection . archbishop of canterbury george carey was ` saddened ' by the decision . archbishop of york john sentamu urges supermarkets to sell charity eggs . supermarkets have cited poor sales as reason behind the decision .

' slipped through the net : __germanwings__ co-pilot andreas __lubitz__ had suffered from depression and ` burnout ' which had held up his career . investigators enter __lubitz__ 's house on the outskirts of dusseldorf yesterday as the probe into the crash continues . in a blunt admission , __carsten__ __spohr__ , the head of lufthansa , which owns the budget airline , admitted __lubitz__ had slipped through the safety net . ` the pilot had passed all his tests , all his medical exams , ' he said . ` he was 100 per cent fit to fly without any restrictions . ` we have at lufthansa , a reporting system where crew can report -- without being punished -- their own problems , or they can report about the problems of others without any kind of punishment . ` all the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case . ' __lubitz__ passed one of the most rigorous assessments when he was accepted for flight training by lufthansa , according to the telegraph . the airline said __lubitz__ trained at the lufthansa flight training school in bremen . an assessment required by germany 's civil aviation authority , the __dlr__ , plus standards imposed by lufthansa were needed before he was accepted . however , although the process includes __psychometric__ testing of the candidate 's ability to work under pressure and handle stress , they do not examine personality or lifestyle more closely , the telegraph reported . lufthansa , like other airlines , does not operate a formal vetting process for aspiring pilots . investigation : french prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation for what appears to be a case of suicide involving mass murder . search : teams working in the difficult alpine terrain clear scattered crash debris and search for bodies and belongings . debris from the jet , operated by lufthansa 's __germanwings__ budget airline , was found near __barcelonnette__ . new information about __lubitz__ 's life emerged just hours after police investigating the disaster began a four-hour search of his flat , which he is said to have shared with a girlfriend . officers found ` evidence of mental illness ' but no suicide note , der spiegel reported . it is understood detectives have found significant material on __lubitz__ 's computer , which they are now carefully examining for any explanation for his terrible actions . he reportedly received a year and half of psychiatric treatment and was at one point recommended to be examined by a doctor before flying . however , he passed his psychological assessments and was later considered fit to fly . germany 's federal aviation office confirmed this morning that __lubitz__ had a medical condition noted in his pilot 's records which required him to have a regular examination . doctors giving pilots their regular medical checks assess their psychological __soundness__ at the same time , according to the uk 's civil aviation authority . this is done before they first fly and at regular intervals after that -- once a year for __under-40s__ and every six months for those over that age . pilots are not made to sit detailed psychological tests , but the doctors are qualified to spot problems including signs of stress , fatigue and drug or alcohol abuse . caa standards state : ` during assessment of the applicant 's history , the doctor should make a general inquiry about mental health , which may include mood , sleep and alcohol use . ` the doctor should observe the applicant during the process of the examination and assess the mental state of the applicant . ' a caa spokesman said : ` there is a psychological element to the pilots ' medical assessments . it forms part of the medical examination which pilots have to undergo to get their medical certificate without which they ca n't fly .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  jenny __ramage__ , 35 , had nine organs removed in an operation dubbed the ` mother of all surgeries ' after doctors discovered she was suffering a rare form of cancer . over the course of a gruelling nine-hour operation , surgeons meticulously removed 10 organs from jenny __ramage__ 's __cancer-ravaged__ body . one by one they worked to rid the then 32-year-old 's abdomen of a rare and aggressive cancer invading her stomach cavity . her right colon , spleen , gall bladder , ovaries , fallopian tubes , appendix and __umbilicus__ or belly button were removed in their entirety . parts of her liver and diaphragm followed . the drastic operation , dubbed the ` mother of all surgeries ' , left ms __ramage__ with a __14-inch__ scar running down the centre of her body - her ` survival trophy ' . she repeatedly consulted doctors complaining of painful stomach cramps . and she was repeatedly dismissed , the finger pointed at period pains , bloating , appendicitis and irritable bowel syndrome . but the true diagnosis was a grave one - a rare and aggressive cancer was invading ms __ramage__ 's body . a doctor finally noticed a tumour on her appendix , which had burst , and covered her internal organs with __jelly-like__ cancerous cells . experts diagnosed the rare disease __pseudomyxoma__ __peritonei__ -lrb- __pmp__ -rrb- - the same disease which claimed the life of hollywood icon audrey hepburn . she spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics , after making a full recovery . ms __ramage__ , now 35 , and from bristol , said : ` the scar does n't really bother me - i see it as a survival trophy . ' i have been very lucky , i have made a full recovery . ` there 's nothing i ca n't do , nothing i ca n't eat or drink . ` but obviously my fertility was compromised , but i still hope to have children someday with the eggs that were frozen just in time . ' ms __ramage__ 's ordeal began in the spring of 2011 when her periods became very irregular . in late summer of that year , she became very __constipated__ and had a constant feeling like trapped wind on her right side , around her appendix . she later discovered this was the tumour on her appendix pressing against her insides . surgeons removed her colon , spleen , gall bladder , ovaries , fallopian tubes , appendix and __umbilicus__ or belly button as well as part of her liver , kidney and diaphragm . she spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics , after making a full recovery . she went to see a doctor several times but was given a range of different diagnosis - including trapped wind and bad digestion . ' i kept on being fobbed off and told it was ibs , they did n't really know what was wrong with me , ' she said . ` one day i took myself to a&e , because i thought i might have appendicitis . ` they said it was probably just wind , and so i felt silly , as if i was a __hypochondriac__ . ' the cancer was finally discovered after a doctor noticed dozens of abnormal white spots covering her insides during a keyhole investigative test . she said : ` then doctors thought my pains were caused by ovarian cysts , so i had scans which showed i did have cysts on my ovaries . ` but it turns out that 's part and parcel of the disease . ` then they inserted cameras into either side of my tummy to see what was in there . ` when i came around after the procedure , i saw little white spots on the pictures , all over my bladder , uterus and bowel . they were everywhere in my body . hollywood icon audrey hepburn died from the rare disease in switzerland in january 1993 . ` but after that , i did n't hear anything , so i thought it had just been the ovarian cysts , which were removed . ' i was still feeling funny and not well , but i thought it must be nothing . ' i went to the follow up appointment months later and the doctor said it was nothing , but about 30 minutes later i got a frantic call from him . ` he said nurses had been chasing me down the corridor to catch me before i left . ` he had spotted the photographs and noticed the white spots , luckily he 'd seen them . ` for noticing them , i owe him my life really . it all happened very quickly after that . ' ms __ramage__ went under the knife at basingstoke hospital , one of only two hospitals in the country that specialise in treating __pmp__ . ` they discovered when they opened me up that the extent of my disease was much greater than the ct scan had suggested - the tumour was scattered everywhere , from my diaphragm , right down to my bladder , ' she said . the 35-year-old now lives a normal life . but she faces the prospect of not being able to have children , after her fallopian tubes were removed . ` they removed all the visible tumour along with the worst-affected organs including my spleen , half my large bowel , my appendix , gall bladder , ovaries and fallopian tubes , the __peritoneum__ , a bit of my liver and they stripped the surface of my diaphragm . ` they scraped some bits of disease off my bladder and uterus . ` they then pumped a heated chemotherapy solution into my abdominal cavity to kill of any remaining microscopic cancer cells . ' the organs removed in their entirety are not essential to sustain life . __pseudomyxoma__ __peritonei__ -lrb- __pmp__ -rrb- is a rare cancer , affecting around one in 500,000 people a year . it typically begins in the appendix , presenting as a small growth , known as a __polyp__ . in more rare cases it is first detected in other parts of the bowel , the ovary or bladder . the __polyp__ eventually spreads through the wall of the organ from where it has __orginated__ . the disease spreads cancerous cells to the lining of the abdominal cavity - the __peritoneum__ . the cancerous cells produce mucus , which collects in the abdomen as a __jelly-like__ fluid called __mucin__ . that fluid __invades__ the abdominal cavity , causing tumours to spread . there are a number of possible origins of __pmp__ , but the most common source is appendix cancer . there is no known underlying cause of __pmp__ . many patients lack clearly defined symptoms , making the disease difficult to spot until the later stages . the most common symptoms are : . source : __pmp__ research foundation . and from the critical and affected organs , the liver , kidney and diaphragm , doctors only removed what was absolutely necessary . following the surgery , ms __ramage__ underwent another radical procedure , a chemotherapy bath . this is where the stomach cavity is filled with hot chemotherapy liquid for around 90 minutes , while the patient remains under anaesthetic . bathing the inside of the stomach with the heated chemotherapy increases the chances of the cancer cells being killed . heat at 42 °c kills cancer cells without affecting normal , healthy cells . the 35-year-old has made a __full-recovery__ and now lives a normal life . but she faces the prospect of not being able to have children , after her fallopian tubes were removed . as a precaution she did have two sets of eggs frozen a few weeks before her life-changing surgery . determined to help others afflicted by the rare disease , ms __ramage__ has now turned her focus to raising awareness of the condition . she warned the bloating of the abdomen that is one of the symptoms caused as the tumour spreads can be mistaken for ` middle-aged spread ' . ` the more people who know about __pmp__ the more lives can be saved , the more people can be diagnosed and get treatment . it 's all down to a lack of awareness , ' she said . ` if i had n't been diagnosed , it would have suffocated my organs and i would have died . it can be a slow growing cancer or it can kill quite quickly , it depends person to person . ' ms __ramage__ is releasing a music video which she has filmed with other __pmp__ survivors and supporters of the condition . her creation is a 21st-century version of billy joel 's we did n't start the fire . the video will be released on youtube next week and her story can be followed on twitter with the hashtag __#pmponeinamillion__ . for more information about __pmp__ visit the charity __pseudomyxoma__ survivor .
